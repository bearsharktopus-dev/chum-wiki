## Overview

The Federation of Saharan States is a sovereign political entity encompassing large portions of the Sahara Desert (~9.2 million km2). Formed primarily by Tuareg tribes - historically nomadic Berber pastoralists whose ancestral lands were fragmented across post-colonial African nation-states - the FSS arose from escalating desertification, regional instability, French metahuman policy in West Africa, and the emergence of superhumans with environmentally attuned abilities.

Beginning in the 1980s, desert-born superhumans manifested abilities suited to environmental challenges: water manipulation, accelerated plant growth, soil regeneration, and subterranean resource detection. Over three decades, they converted vast stretches of barren sand into arable land, unlocked underground water reserves, and exposed mineral wealth - providing the economic and political basis for federation.

The FSS represents a fundamentally different model of superhuman integration from Western nations. Metahuman abilities are understood as communal resources and spiritual gifts rather than framed through a hero-villain paradigm. Superhumans are called "miracle workers," not superheroes, and powered criminals are simply "criminals." The federation's environmental achievements have drawn international attention as a potential model for addressing desertification worldwide.

## History

### Pre-Federation (Pre-2015)

The Tuareg inhabited the Sahara for centuries as nomadic pastoralists, organized into confederations governed by a supreme chief (Amenokal) and a council of elders. Their society was structured around clan memberships, caste hierarchies, and generational knowledge of water sources, grazing lands, and desert navigation. The post-colonial era fragmented Tuareg territory across Niger, Mali, Algeria, Libya, and Burkina Faso, forcing them to contend with centralized states often at odds with their nomadic governance.

### Superhuman Emergence (1980s-2010s)

Superhumans began appearing in the Sahara during the 1980s, activated through near-death experiences common in the extreme environment. These individuals were absorbed into existing cultural and spiritual frameworks - regarded as embodiments of ancient myths rather than costumed heroes. Their powers concentrated on environmental applications, and over three decades their cumulative work produced the large-scale greening, agricultural renaissance, and economic foundations for political unification.

### Foundation (2015-2016)

The FSS was formally established in 2015 through a coalition of major Tuareg tribal groups - notably the Kel Ahaggar, Kel Ajjer, and Iwellemmedan - alongside other Saharan communities. It consolidated multiple tribal regions under unified governance while preserving traditional political customs. In 2016, the ISC's Crisis Response Unit conducted the Saharan Agricultural Initiative in support of the FSS's environmental program.

### Contemporary Period

The FSS occupies a unique position as a young nation built on ecological reclamation, navigating international diplomacy, resource-driven foreign interest, and the internal challenge of harmonizing tribal customs with modern governance.

## Structure

The FSS adapts the traditional Tuareg political system for a multi-tribal federation with a superhuman population.

- **Amenokal (Supreme Chief)** - Head of state, inherited from the traditional Tuareg leadership role. The founding Amenokal was Mohamed Ag Echaka (Kel Ahaggar), credited with integrating superhuman capabilities into governance. The current Amenokal is Tarek Ag Ibrahim, who possesses chlorokinesis (fruit growth).
- **Governing Council** - Delegates from constituent tribes and superhuman communities, retaining the elder-council system while incorporating modern roles for superhuman integration.
- **Clan and Caste Considerations** - Traditional Tuareg social hierarchies remain a factor; the governance framework attempts to ensure all constituent groups are represented.

## Members

| Name | Role | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Tarek Ag Ibrahim | Amenokal (Supreme Chief); chlorokinesis (fruit growth) | Active |
| Mohamed Ag Echaka | Former Amenokal (Supreme Chief); Kel Ahaggar tribe | Former |

## Operations

The FSS focuses on environmental transformation and resource development rather than conventional military activity.

- **Desert Greening** - The defining initiative: large-scale moisture retention, soil regeneration, and climate-adaptive plant cultivation converting desert into farmland
- **Water Resource Development** - Superhuman detection and exploitation of underground water reserves for sustained irrigation
- **Agricultural Production** - Greened territories support a growing sector attracting global agribusiness interest
- **Mineral Extraction** - Superhuman abilities have exposed vast deposits previously locked beneath the desert
- **Diplomacy** - Navigating sovereignty disputes and resource competition with neighboring nations and global powers

## Relationships

| Organization | Relationship |
|--------------|--------------|
| International Superhuman Coalition (ISC) | International partner; ISC Crisis Response Unit conducted the 2016 Saharan Agricultural Initiative in support of FSS greening efforts |
| Neighboring African nations (Niger, Mali, Algeria, Libya, Burkina Faso, Mauritania) | Complex; FSS territory was carved from land historically administered by these states; diplomatic relations involve sovereignty disputes and resource competition |
| Global agribusiness interests | Economic partners; attracted by FSS agricultural innovation and newly fertile land |

## Trivia

- The FSS is listed among major geopolitical changes in the Chum world alongside the dissolution of the UAE, Kurdish independence, and the Amazonian Autonomous Zone. It is referred to as the "United Saharan States" in one instance, though "Federation of Saharan States" is the primary designation.
- The in-universe article detailing the FSS was written by Dr. Lena Adebowale for the March 2018 issue of National Geographic.
- Maya Richardson cited the FSS as a model for superpowers being used for the public good upon her resignation from City Council.
- Sam first learned about the FSS while reading in Miasma's safehouse during her time as a fugitive, struck by how much larger metahuman politics was beyond Philadelphia.
