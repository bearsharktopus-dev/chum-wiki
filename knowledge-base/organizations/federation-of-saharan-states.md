# The Federation of Saharan States

> A sovereign federation of Saharan tribal regions established in 2015, formed through superhuman-driven environmental transformation of the Sahara Desert and led by a coalition of Tuareg tribes under a modernized traditional governance system.

## Overview

The Federation of Saharan States is a sovereign political entity encompassing large portions of the Sahara Desert, the world's largest hot desert at approximately 9.2 million square kilometers. The FSS was formed primarily by Tuareg tribes -- historically nomadic Berber pastoralists whose ancestral lands had been fragmented across multiple post-colonial African nation-states -- in response to escalating desertification, regional instability, and the transformative emergence of superhumans with environmentally attuned abilities.

What distinguishes the FSS from most other nations is its foundation in superhuman-driven ecological restoration. Beginning in the 1980s, superhumans born from the harsh near-death conditions of the desert manifested abilities uniquely suited to environmental challenges: water manipulation, accelerated plant growth, soil regeneration, and subterranean resource detection. Over roughly three decades, these individuals converted vast stretches of barren sand into arable land, unlocked underground water reserves, and exposed previously inaccessible mineral wealth. This ecological transformation provided the economic and political basis for federation.

The FSS represents a fundamentally different model of superhuman integration from that seen in Western nations. Metahuman abilities are not framed through a hero-villain paradigm but are instead understood as communal resources and spiritual gifts, woven into the existing cultural and belief systems of the Saharan peoples. The federation's success in environmental restoration has drawn international attention as a potential model for addressing desertification worldwide.

## History

### Pre-Federation (Pre-2015)

The Tuareg people inhabited the Sahara for centuries as nomadic pastoralists, organized into confederations governed by a supreme chief (Amenokal) and a council of elders. Their society was structured around complex clan memberships, social statuses, and caste hierarchies, sustained by an intimate generational knowledge of water sources, grazing lands, and desert navigation.

The post-colonial era of the 20th century fragmented Tuareg ancestral territory across newly independent nations including Niger, Mali, Algeria, Libya, and Burkina Faso. This political reorganization forced the Tuareg to contend with centralized modern states that were often at odds with their traditional nomadic governance and way of life.

### Superhuman Emergence (1980s--2010s)

Superhumans began appearing in the Sahara during the 1980s, their abilities activated through the near-death experiences common in such an extreme environment. Unlike in Western contexts, these individuals were absorbed into existing cultural and spiritual frameworks -- regarded as embodiments of ancient myths or living miracles rather than costumed heroes or villains. Their powers concentrated around environmental applications: water summoning and manipulation, plant growth enhancement, underground resource discovery, and climate adaptation. Over three decades, the cumulative effect of their work produced a large-scale greening of formerly barren desert, an agricultural renaissance, and the economic foundations for political unification.

### Foundation and the Saharan Agricultural Initiative (2015--2016)

The FSS was formally established in 2015 through a coalition of major Tuareg tribal groups -- notably the Kel Ahaggar, Kel Ajjer, and Iwellemmedan -- alongside other Saharan communities. The federation consolidated multiple tribal regions under a unified governance structure while preserving traditional political customs. In 2016, the International Superhuman Coalition's Crisis Response Unit conducted the Saharan Agricultural Initiative, an operation focused on desert greening that intersected with and supported the FSS's broader environmental program.

### Contemporary Period

The FSS now occupies a unique position on the world stage: a young nation built on ecological reclamation, navigating the competing pressures of international diplomacy, resource-driven foreign interest, and the internal challenge of harmonizing centuries-old tribal customs with modern centralized governance. Its environmental achievements have attracted both admiration and strategic scrutiny from neighboring countries and global powers.

## Structure

The FSS governance model adapts the traditional Tuareg political system to accommodate a multi-tribal federation and its superhuman population.

- **Amenokal (Supreme Chief)** -- The head of state, a role inherited from the traditional Tuareg leadership position. The current Amenokal is Mohamed Ag Echaka of the Kel Ahaggar tribe, a hereditary leader credited with integrating superhuman capabilities into the federation's governance and development strategy.
- **Governing Council** -- A representative body comprising delegates from the federation's constituent tribes and superhuman communities. The council retains elements of the traditional elder-council system while incorporating new roles and positions created to address the political realities of superhuman integration and modern statecraft.
- **Clan and Caste Considerations** -- Traditional Tuareg social hierarchies based on clan membership and caste remain a factor in the federation's internal politics. The governance framework attempts to ensure that the voices of all constituent groups -- tribal and superhuman alike -- are represented.

## Operations

The FSS's primary operations center on environmental transformation and resource development rather than conventional military or law enforcement activity.

- **Desert Greening** -- The federation's defining initiative. Superhumans with environmental abilities carry out large-scale moisture retention, soil regeneration, and climate-adaptive plant cultivation across formerly barren territory, converting desert into farmland.
- **Water Resource Development** -- Discovery and exploitation of underground water reserves through superhuman resource-detection abilities, providing the sustained irrigation necessary for agriculture.
- **Agricultural Production** -- The greened territories support a growing agricultural sector that has attracted global agribusiness interest and provides food security for the federation's population.
- **Mineral Extraction** -- Superhuman abilities have exposed vast mineral deposits previously locked beneath the desert terrain, contributing to the FSS's economic base.
- **Diplomacy and Sovereignty Maintenance** -- Navigating international relations with neighboring African nations and global powers, many of whom view the FSS's resources and strategic positioning with competing interests.

## Relationships

| Organization | Relationship |
|--------------|--------------|
| International Superhuman Coalition (ISC) | International partner; ISC Crisis Response Unit conducted the 2016 Saharan Agricultural Initiative in support of FSS greening efforts |
| Neighboring African nations (Niger, Mali, Algeria, Libya, Burkina Faso) | Complex; FSS territory was carved from land historically administered by these states; diplomatic relations involve sovereignty disputes and resource competition |
| Global agribusiness interests | Economic partners; attracted by FSS agricultural innovation and newly fertile land |

## Trivia

- The FSS is listed among major geopolitical changes in the Chum world alongside the dissolution of the UAE, Kurdish independence, and the establishment of the Amazonian Autonomous Zone. The factsheet refers to it as the "United Saharan States" in one instance, though "Federation of Saharan States" is the primary designation used in all detailed sources.
- The superhero-versus-supervillain dynamic that dominates Western metahuman culture is largely absent in the FSS. Superhumans are regarded as extraordinary community members rather than combatants.
- The Sahara's environmental transformation began decades before the FSS's formal founding, with superhuman activity dating back to the 1980s.
- The in-universe article detailing the FSS was written by Dr. Lena Adebowale for the March 2018 issue of National Geographic.
