## Overview

The Boston Red Shocks are a five-member powered cell led by The Colonel, conducting covert operations against corporate and governmental targets. Their activities center on theft and redistribution of documents exposing corruption, gentrification schemes, and collusion between private developers and city officials. The group maintains a strict policy against killing and distinguishes itself from violent accelerationist cells rumored to exist in other cities.

Most members participate in a broader Northeast mutual aid network (food banks, clinics, housing programs) during daylight hours. The Red Shocks' covert operations address what mutual aid cannot: liberating documents, disrupting facilities, and pressuring targets insulated from ordinary political accountability.

Under the PERKS-era legal framework, the Red Shocks would likely be classified as Ideological Power Entities - a subcategory comprising approximately 25% of powered criminals, considered high-priority targets by law enforcement.

## History

The founding history is not established. By the time Clay (Claymore) joined, the other four members had been operating together for an extended period with established routines and references to prior operations.

Clay's recruitment occurred approximately four months after her activation event at the Boston Commons, during which she involuntarily detonated and injured nearly one hundred people. She had been practicing alone in an abandoned shipping facility in South Boston when the existing members located her. The Colonel offered training, framing the group as people who had all experienced loss of control over their powers and learned to manage them collectively. Clay began training at the condemned factory in Everett.

The only detailed operation was the Alcott Properties raid (see Operations), with Clay serving her first field role as breacher.

The Boston Commons explosion may correspond to the widely reported explosions at Boston protests in September 2025, covered in the main narrative as a crisis event (Arc 13). If so, CM.1 would be set approximately January 2026.

## Structure

The Colonel leads with clear authority; other members fill specialized roles based on powers and skills. Operational roles during the Alcott raid:

- **Breach**: Claymore - defeating locks and physical barriers with explosive abilities
- **Overwatch**: Red Scare - elevated position, monitoring approaches, early warning
- **Documents**: Ghostwriter - locating, scanning, and copying target documents
- **Technical Support**: Lavender Girl - alarms, security systems, electronic countermeasures
- **Command**: The Colonel - vehicle, communications, extraction coordination

The group uses a white cargo van disguised as a carpet cleaning service and communicates via earpieces during operations.

| Unknown | The Colonel | Leader, Commander | Active |

### Claymore - Power Details

Clay can detach and explosively detonate her own biological tissue (fingernails, hair, fingers), triggered on impact or by percussive force. Detonations are concussive rather than thermal. Output scales with tissue volume: a fingernail yields approximately 150 joules (enough to breach a deadbolt), a full finger roughly 800 joules, a hand's worth of fingernails approximately 1,000 joules. Ghostwriter estimated her body at roughly two-thirds the explosive density of dynamite, with waste heat surgically removed. Detached tissue regenerates rapidly - fingernails in 30-40 minutes, a severed thumb in one to two hours, with immediate callusing over wound sites. The regeneration requires significant caloric intake.

### Ghostwriter - Power Details

Abilities not fully detailed. Carries a backpack of books he calls his "soldiers" and murmurs to before operations. Wears pristine white archival gloves at all times. During the Alcott raid, ash was observed around his ungloved hand while handling documents, suggesting he absorbs written material through physical contact.

### Red Scare - Power Details

Enhanced agility, speed, and situational awareness. Moves with fluid grace, scales fire escapes silently and near-instantaneously, and tracks multiple targets with preternatural perception he describes as impossible to turn off.

### Lavender Girl - Power Details

Botanical manipulation - can accelerate plant growth in real time and cultivate hybrids (including a potato-onion crossbreed) that survive New England winters. Separately possesses technical proficiency with electronic security systems, using microcomputers to bypass alarm panels. Prepares protein bars, tinctures, and compounds carried in a field kit described as potentially violating the Geneva Convention.

### The Colonel - Power Details

Specific power unknown. Carries a Walther PPK with hazard-yellow spraypaint as a backup for when her power is insufficient, confirming she possesses a combat-capable ability.

## Operations

Members described their activities as "aggressively investigative journalism" with "occasional property damage."

### Alcott Properties Raid (January, approximately 2026)

Targeted Alcott Properties, a real estate developer in a converted warehouse in Boston's Seaport District. Alcott had been buying buildings in East Boston, inflating rents, displacing long-term residents, and coordinating with city officials to expedite evictions.

The team began at approximately 11:30 PM, thirty minutes before the midnight guard shift change. Red Scare took overwatch on a parking garage roof. Lavender Girl bypassed the alarm on the service door, and Claymore breached the steel door by inserting detached fingernails into the deadbolt and detonating them with a hammer strike. On the third floor, Claymore breached the reinforced file room door using fingernails augmented with strands of hair as improvised detonation cord.

Ghostwriter scanned eviction records, city correspondence, and financial transfer documents, and appeared to consume select documents through direct contact. The team exfiltrated when Red Scare reported a guard approaching, departing with approximately ninety seconds to spare. Red Scare exfiltrated independently to a secondary pickup point.

### Mutual Aid Activities

During daylight hours, members contribute to a broader Northeast mutual aid network:

- Lavender Girl grows produce for community food supplies
- Red Scare teaches self-defense at a community center in Jamaica Plain
- The Colonel volunteers at a shelter in Dorchester
- Ghostwriter reads to children at a library on Wednesday afternoons

## Relationships

| Organization | Relationship |
|--------------|-------------|
| Northeast Mutual Aid Network | Affiliated; Red Shocks members participated in the network's food banks, clinics, and housing programs during daytime hours |
| Alcott Properties | Target; the Red Shocks raided Alcott's offices to obtain documents proving collusion with city officials in forced evictions |
| Other powered leftist cells (unnamed) | Aware of but distinct from; the Red Shocks distinguished themselves from violent accelerationist and adventurist cells rumored to operate in other cities |
| Bookstore owner (Allston) | Sympathizer; provided basement space in exchange for inventory help and plausible deniability |

## Trivia

- The bookstore basement was accessed via stairs "not technically up to code." The owner maintained plausible deniability by requesting never to be told what they did down there.
- Ghostwriter described their explosives as "targeted explosives. Artisanal explosives. Small-batch, locally-sourced explosives." He was reading Bulgakov's *The Master and Margarita* during the pre-operation briefing.
- The van was stenciled "SUPERIOR CARPET CLEANING" in faded blue letters.
- Clay's journalist background informed her constant observational narration - she described cataloging details as a "journalism reflex." Her codename references both the antipersonnel mine and the nature of her abilities.
- CM.1 was titled as part of "Arc 15.5: This Side Up."
