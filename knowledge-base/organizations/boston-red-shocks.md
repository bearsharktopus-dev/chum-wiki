## Overview

The Boston Red Shocks were a small, ideologically motivated powered cell operating out of the basement of a used bookstore in Allston, Boston. Led by the woman known as The Colonel, the group consisted of five members who conducted covert operations against corporate and governmental targets. Their activities centered on the theft and redistribution of documents exposing corruption, gentrification schemes, and collusion between private developers and city officials. The group explicitly distinguished itself from violent accelerationist cells rumored to exist in other cities, maintaining a strict policy against killing and minimizing physical harm to people.

The Red Shocks occupied a specific niche within Boston's powered leftist community. A broader mutual aid network of healers, growers, and builders operated across the Northeast, running food banks, medical clinics, and housing assistance programs. Most Red Shocks members participated in this above-board mutual aid work during daylight hours. The Red Shocks' covert operations addressed what the mutual aid network could not: liberating documents, disrupting facilities, and applying pressure to targets who had insulated themselves from ordinary political accountability. Members described their work as "aggressively investigative journalism with unusual access" -- and explosives.

Under the PERKS-era legal framework, the Red Shocks would likely be classified as Ideological Power Entities, a subcategory of criminal superhumans comprising approximately 25% of powered criminals. Groups in this classification possessed specific political or social agendas and were considered high-priority targets by law enforcement.

## History

The full founding history of the Boston Red Shocks was not established in available source material. By the time the narrator, Clay (codename Claymore), joined the group, the other four members -- The Colonel, Ghostwriter, Red Scare, and Lavender Girl -- had been operating together for an extended period, with established routines, inside jokes, and references to prior operations that predated Clay's involvement.

Clay's recruitment occurred approximately four months after her activation event at the Boston Commons, during which she involuntarily detonated and injured nearly one hundred people. She had been practicing alone in an abandoned shipping facility in South Boston when the four existing members located her. The Colonel offered training and membership, framing the group as people who had all experienced loss of control over their powers and had learned to manage them collectively. Clay accepted and began training at the group's secondary facility, a condemned factory in Everett.

The only operation described in detail was a raid on Alcott Properties, a real estate developer in the Seaport District of Boston. Alcott had been buying buildings in East Boston, inflating rents, forcing out long-term residents, and coordinating with city officials to expedite evictions. The Red Shocks infiltrated the company's third-floor offices in a converted warehouse, copied documents proving collusion between Alcott and municipal officials, and exfiltrated without harming anyone. The documents were intended for distribution to journalists. The operation took place in January, with Clay serving her first field role as the team's breacher.

The Boston Commons explosion referenced in Clay's backstory may correspond to the widely reported explosions at Boston protests in September 2025, which were covered in the main narrative as a crisis event witnessed remotely by characters in Philadelphia (Arc 13). If so, the CM.1 interlude would be set approximately January 2026.

## Structure

The Red Shocks operated with a clear but informal hierarchy. The Colonel served as the undisputed leader, issuing orders, assigning roles, and making tactical decisions. Below her, the other members filled specialized operational roles based on their individual powers and skills.

Operational roles for the Alcott Properties raid were assigned as follows:

- **Breach**: Claymore (Clay) -- responsible for defeating locks and physical barriers using her explosive abilities.
- **Overwatch**: Red Scare -- stationed on an elevated position across from the target, monitoring approaches and providing early warning.
- **Documents**: Ghostwriter -- responsible for locating, scanning, and copying target documents.
- **Technical Support**: Lavender Girl -- handled alarms, security systems, and electronic countermeasures.
- **Command**: The Colonel -- drove the vehicle, monitored communications, and coordinated extraction from a mobile position.

The group used a white cargo van disguised as a carpet cleaning service for transport. Communication during operations was conducted via earpieces. The bookstore basement served as the primary planning and meeting space, while the condemned factory in Everett was used for training and practice.

## Members

| Name | Codename | Role | Powers | Status |

| Unknown | Ghostwriter | Document Specialist | Book-related abilities (spoke to and commanded books as "soldiers"; wore archival gloves; appeared to consume documents by touch to absorb their contents) | Active |
| Unknown | Red Scare | Overwatch, Lookout | Enhanced agility, speed, and awareness (moved with liquid grace, scaled fire escapes silently, tracked multiple targets with preternatural perception he could not deactivate) | Active |
| Unknown | Lavender Girl | Technical Support, Medic | Botanical manipulation (accelerated plant growth, cultivated hybrid plants, grew vegetables through New England winters); also possessed technical/electronics skills unrelated to her plant abilities | Active |

### Claymore -- Power Details

Clay's abilities centered on the explosive detonation of her own biological tissue. She could voluntarily detach fingernails, hair, and larger body parts (up to entire fingers), then trigger them to explode on impact or via percussive force (striking with a hammer). The detonations were concussive rather than thermal, producing pressure waves rather than fireballs. Each fingernail yielded approximately 150 joules -- sufficient to breach a standard deadbolt or shatter a window. Larger expenditures scaled accordingly: a full finger produced roughly 800 joules, and a full hand's worth of fingernails approximately 1,000 joules. She described her body as having roughly two-thirds the explosive density of dynamite, with waste heat surgically removed. Detached tissue regenerated rapidly, with fingernails regrowing in 30-40 minutes and a severed thumb in one to two hours. The regeneration process involved immediate callusing over wound sites. Clay required significant caloric intake to offset tissue expenditure, though the energy requirements were partially offset by the anomalous nature of her abilities.

### Ghostwriter -- Power Details

Ghostwriter's abilities were not fully detailed. He carried a backpack full of books described as his "soldiers" and murmured to them before operations. He wore pristine white archival gloves at all times. During the Alcott raid, a small cloud of ash was observed around his ungloved hand while handling documents, suggesting he consumed or absorbed written material through physical contact.

### Red Scare -- Power Details

Red Scare demonstrated enhanced physical capabilities including exceptional agility, speed, and situational awareness. He moved with a fluid quality compared to water finding its level, scaled a fire escape silently and near-instantaneously, and tracked vehicle movements and guard positions with a perception he described as impossible to turn off. He also taught self-defense classes at a community center in Jamaica Plain.

### Lavender Girl -- Power Details

Lavender Girl could accelerate and manipulate plant growth, coaxing leaves to unfurl visibly in real time and cultivating hybrid plants (including an apparent potato-onion crossbreed). She grew vegetables that survived New England winters. Separately, she demonstrated technical proficiency with electronic security systems, using microcomputers to bypass alarm panels. She also prepared protein bars, tinctures, and compounds carried in a field kit described as potentially violating the Geneva Convention.

## Operations

The Red Shocks' operational focus was the covert acquisition and redistribution of documents exposing corruption and institutional abuse. Members described their activities as "aggressively investigative journalism" with "occasional property damage." The group maintained a strict ethical boundary: they did not kill, and they avoided injuring people when possible.

### Alcott Properties Raid (January, approximately 2026)

The only operation described in detail targeted Alcott Properties, a real estate developer occupying the third floor of a converted warehouse in Boston's Seaport District. Intelligence indicated that Alcott had been buying buildings in East Boston, inflating rents, displacing long-term resident families, and coordinating with city officials to expedite evictions. A contact provided the guard rotation schedule prior to the operation.

The team deployed at 11:00 PM, approximately thirty minutes before the midnight guard shift change. Red Scare established an overwatch position on a parking garage roof across the street. Lavender Girl bypassed the electronic alarm on the service door, and Claymore breached the steel door by inserting detached fingernails into the deadbolt mechanism and detonating them with a hammer strike. The team ascended to the third floor, where Claymore breached the reinforced file room door using the same technique augmented with strands of her own hair as improvised detonation cord.

Ghostwriter located and scanned eviction records, city correspondence, and financial transfer documents using a portable scanner. He also appeared to consume select documents through direct contact. The team exfiltrated when Red Scare reported a guard approaching via the east stairwell, departing through the service entrance and extracting by van with approximately ninety seconds to spare. Red Scare exfiltrated independently to a secondary pickup point. The copied documents were intended for distribution to journalists.

### Mutual Aid Activities

During daylight hours, Red Shocks members contributed to a broader Northeast mutual aid network:
- Lavender Girl grew produce for community food supplies.
- Red Scare taught self-defense classes at a community center in Jamaica Plain.
- The Colonel volunteered at a shelter in Dorchester.
- Ghostwriter read to children at a library on Wednesday afternoons.

## Trivia

- The group operated out of a bookstore basement accessed via stairs that were "not technically up to code."
- The bookstore owner maintained plausible deniability by explicitly requesting never to be told what the group did in her basement.
- Ghostwriter described the group's use of explosives as "targeted explosives. Artisanal explosives. Small-batch, locally-sourced explosives."
- The Colonel carried a Walther PPK handgun with the trigger and grip spraypainted hazard yellow, described as a backup for when her primary power was insufficient.
- The group's disguise vehicle was a white cargo van stenciled with "SUPERIOR CARPET CLEANING" in faded blue letters.
- Clay's journalist background informed her constant observational narration; she described cataloging details as a "journalism reflex."
- Ghostwriter was reading Bulgakov's *The Master and Margarita* during the pre-operation briefing.
- Clay's codename "Claymore" referenced both the antipersonnel mine and the nature of her abilities.
- The CM.1 interlude was titled as part of "Arc 15.5: This Side Up."
