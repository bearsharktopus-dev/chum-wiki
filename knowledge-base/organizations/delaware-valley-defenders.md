## Overview

The Delaware Valley Defenders are Philadelphia's original and longest-standing registered superhuman team. As a Registered Superhuman Entity, the DVD operates under federal authority: its members are government employees who receive a paycheck for their superhero work, their identities are public record accessible through FOIA requests, and they enjoy legal protections comparable to those afforded to law enforcement officers. The team's core mandate encompasses rapid response to emergencies, search and rescue operations, disaster relief, and serving as the primary line of defense against hostile superhumans operating within Philadelphia's borders.

The DVD represents the institutional, establishment approach to superheroism in the Chum universe. Its members operate within the system, observe due process, coordinate with law enforcement, and maintain chain of evidence through the guidance of dedicated legal counsel. This philosophy stands in deliberate contrast to the more aggressive, proactive methods employed by younger vigilante teams such as the Auditors. The tension between institutional responsibility and the urgency of direct action is a defining thematic current running through the team's interactions with Sam Small and her allies throughout the story.

In addition to its adult roster, the DVD historically operated the Young Defenders, a training and mentorship program for teenage superhumans that served as a pipeline for future team members. The Young Defenders program was disbanded following the passage of Councilwoman Maya Richardson's Superhuman Activity Regulation Act in March 2025, which banned superhero activities for minors. The DVD remained Philadelphia's sole registered team until the establishment of Argus Corps, a second registered team operating under Richardson's political auspices.

## History

The Delaware Valley Defenders were founded by Professor Franklin (Jeffery Brown), a superhuman with electricity-based powers who led the team during its early years. Under Franklin's leadership, the DVD established itself as Philadelphia's premier superhero institution, combating dangerous villains including Shrike (Niles Nolan) and building a reputation for thoughtful, strategic heroism. Franklin was known for his calm, methodical approach and his commitment to mentoring the next generation of heroes.

Professor Franklin was killed approximately in 2015 while attempting to apprehend the radioactive supervillain Chernobyl (Illya Myronovych Fedorov). His death at the same abandoned PES refinery that would later claim another DVD leader sent shockwaves through the Philadelphia superhero community. Franklin was eulogized at Laurel Hill Cemetery, with superheroes, students, and citizens in attendance.

Leadership passed to Diane Williams, known as Liberty Belle, Franklin's protege who had served under his mentorship. Belle brought superhuman strength, enhanced proprioception, and formidable detective skills to the role, and she continued the tradition of training young heroes through the Young Defenders program. It was Belle who recruited Sam Small to the Young Defenders in August 2023, recognizing the teenager's potential despite Belle's own terminal cancer diagnosis. Belle maintained an aggressive investigative posture toward the Kingdom of Keys and the circumstances surrounding Chernobyl's government connections, a pursuit that drew criticism from some who viewed her as reckless and suicidal in her methods.

On the first night of Hanukkah in December 2023, Liberty Belle confronted Chernobyl at the same abandoned refinery where Professor Franklin had died. Despite Sam's unauthorized intervention, Belle was fatally wounded, dying in Sam's arms. Belle's death -- coming while she was already terminally ill with only months to live -- became a defining event for the DVD and the broader Philadelphia superhero community.

Following Belle's death, Multiplex (Elijah Brooks) assumed effective leadership of the team. Where Belle had been charismatic and inspirational, Multiplex brought a philosophy rooted in systems, structure, and discipline. He had been second-in-command during Belle's tenure and had openly disagreed with her approach to mentoring, favoring institutional frameworks over charismatic leadership. Under Multiplex, the DVD continued its mission while grappling with depleted ranks and the need to promote Young Defenders to the senior roster.

In late July 2024, the Philly Phreaks launched an attack outside the courthouse during Chernobyl's trial, distributing tainted Jump to crowds and causing mass chaos. The DVD and Young Defenders responded jointly, with the aftermath prompting discussions about graduating Young Defenders members to fill gaps in the senior team. Crossroads was promoted to the DVD, and Rampart assumed leadership of the Young Defenders.

The team faced a major blow in March 2025 when Richardson's Superhuman Activity Regulation Act effectively dissolved the Young Defenders. Team members scattered: Rampart joined the DVD officially, Gossamer initially left superhero work before joining the Auditors, and Sam refused to comply with the ban. Shortly after, a Kingdom ambush during a prison transport operation left Captain Plasma incapacitated, further straining the team's resources.

By summer 2025, Multiplex began personally training Sam in boxing and tactical combat at DVD headquarters, marking an evolution in the team's relationship with the young vigilante. Captain Plasma, after recovering from pneumonia caused by the prison transport incident, departed Philadelphia on a federally sponsored tour to combat a nationwide crime wave, leaving the local roster further diminished.

Throughout the story's events, the DVD has maintained a complicated relationship with Sam and the Auditors -- simultaneously serving as mentors, allies, authority figures, and occasionally obstacles. Councilman Davis has provided political cover and intelligence while Crossroads has operated as a key contact between the institutional team and Sam's independent operations.

## Structure

The Delaware Valley Defenders operate with a relatively flat command structure organized around a team leader supported by field operatives, civilian support staff, and a political liaison.

**Leadership:** The team leader serves as both field commander and organizational head. The position has passed through three holders: Professor Franklin (founder), Liberty Belle (successor), and Multiplex (current effective leader). The leader coordinates operations, sets strategic priorities, and represents the team in dealings with federal agencies and local government.

**Field Operatives:** The core combat roster consists of powered individuals who respond to emergencies, conduct patrols, and engage hostile superhumans. Operatives include Bulwark, Fury Forge, Crossroads, Rampart, and Captain Plasma (currently on tour).

**Support Staff:** Non-combat personnel provide essential services. Nurse Sylvia handles medical care and metahuman rehabilitation. Clarissa Parker serves as legal counsel, ensuring chain of evidence is maintained and operations remain above board.

**Civilian Liaison:** Councilman Jamal Davis bridges the gap between the team and Philadelphia's municipal government, providing political cover, resources, intelligence, and coordination with law enforcement.

**Young Defenders (Disbanded):** The team formerly operated a youth training program that mentored teenage superhumans, preparing them for eventual promotion to the senior roster. Members included Sam Small, Jordan Westwood, Lily Chen, Maxwell Martinez, Jason Reynolds, Amelia, Jamila Fayad, Connor, Akilah Washington, and Devonte, among others. The program was dissolved following the Superhuman Activity Regulation Act of March 2025.

## Operations

The DVD's operational mandate centers on four primary functions: rapid response to superhuman emergencies, search and rescue during disasters, disaster relief coordination, and serving as the first line of defense against hostile superhumans. Unlike vigilante teams, the DVD operates within legal frameworks, maintaining chain of evidence and coordinating with law enforcement and emergency services.

**Notable Operations and Events:**

- **Shrike Apprehension (pre-story):** Liberty Belle and Professor Franklin combined efforts to subdue the villain Shrike (Niles Nolan), who had been terrorizing the Strawberry Mansion neighborhood with metal spike attacks, and turned him over to police custody.
- **Kingdom of Keys Investigation (2023-ongoing):** The DVD conducted ongoing surveillance and intelligence-gathering on the Kingdom of Keys criminal organization, coordinating with the Young Defenders and later the Auditors. Sam brought Kingdom intelligence from undercover operations to the DVD for strategic discussion on multiple occasions.
- **Chernobyl Trial Security (August 2024):** The DVD provided security during the trial of Illya Fedorov and responded to the Philly Phreaks' courthouse attack, conducting search and rescue and leading debriefing efforts in the aftermath.
- **Operation Ivory / Zoo Battle (December 2024):** The DVD deployed to the Philadelphia Zoo to counter the Kingdom's attempted theft of rhinos, with Captain Plasma, Multiplex, Fury Forge, and Crossroads engaging Kingdom operatives including Mr. T-Rex. The DVD came to acknowledge Sam's tactical judgment after she identified the true purpose of the attack.
- **Prison Transport (March 2025):** Captain Plasma led security for the transport of Kingdom prisoners Mr. Nothing and Mudslide. The Kingdom ambushed the convoy on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, incapacitating Plasma and liberating both prisoners.
- **Three-Day Hostage Situation (February 2025):** The DVD handled a multi-day hostage crisis in West Philadelphia, which occupied the team's resources and delayed their response to Aaron McKinley's arson campaign.
- **Aaron McKinley Investigation (February 2025):** Multiplex, Captain Plasma, and Crossroads questioned Sam at the hospital following the school fire incident. Crossroads used his precognitive abilities to gather information from Sam about Aaron's identity and powers.
- **Tainted Jump Response (ongoing, 2025):** Bulwark conducted undercover investigations into Rogue Wave's Jump distribution at Temple University, uncovering that the Kingdom was intercepting Rogue Wave shipments, modifying compounds, and releasing tainted pills to street-level distributors.
- **Roxborough Memorial Operation (late 2025):** The DVD responded to an anonymous tip (from Sam) about suspicious activity, resulting in the arrest of 19 individuals including 15 Rogue Wave members and 4 Kingdom operatives, including the high-value target Mr. Polygraph.

The DVD also maintains an anonymous tip line that civilian informants and allied vigilantes -- including Sam -- have used to relay intelligence without creating legally compromising direct contact.

## Relationships

| Organization | Relationship |
|--------------|-------------|
| The Auditors | Complex ally; Sam's independent team frequently shares intelligence with the DVD while operating outside its institutional constraints; philosophical tension over methods |
| Young Defenders (disbanded) | Former subsidiary training program; served as pipeline for DVD recruitment |
| Tacony Titans | Allied; local superhero team that coordinates with the DVD on neighborhood patrols and joint operations |
| Argus Corps | Rival registered team; operates under Maya Richardson's political auspices as a more aggressive counterpart to the DVD |
| NSRA (National Superhuman Response Agency) | Oversight body; the DVD operates under NSRA regulatory authority as a Registered Superhuman Entity |
| Kingdom of Keys | Primary antagonist; criminal organization the DVD has been investigating and combating throughout the story |
| Rogue Wave | Antagonist; drug-trafficking organization distributing Jump and Fly across Philadelphia |
| Philadelphia City Government | Employer and oversight; Councilman Davis serves as liaison; relationship complicated by Richardson's anti-vigilante legislation |

## Trivia

- The DVD's headquarters includes a full gym, medical wing, meeting chambers, and locker rooms, and at one point housed the Young Defenders' obstacle course, which was dismantled and packed away after the team's dissolution.
- Fury Forge chose her codename because it sounded cool rather than for any thematic reason related to her powers.
- Captain Plasma once tacitly approved an unauthorized patrol by Sam and Rampart by asking them to bring him back a turkey sub, which Sam corrected to "hoagie" -- the proper Philadelphia term.
- The Interlude BA.1 provides a rare look at the adult DVD members discussing team dynamics, recruitment, and the aftermath of Liberty Belle and Professor Franklin's deaths without Sam present.
- Bulwark's catchphrase for younger heroes is "young one," and he speaks without compound words due to his Ghanaian speech patterns.
- The DVD's legal counsel Clarissa Parker is described as good at finding loopholes and "a little underhanded but for the greater good."
- Monkey Business of Rogue Wave likely anticipated that Sam would tip off the DVD during the Roxborough operation, suggesting the DVD's movements are at least partially predictable to outside actors.
- Professor Franklin wore a white lab coat over up-to-date Kevlar with fingerless gloves, establishing a distinctive professional aesthetic for the team's founding era.
