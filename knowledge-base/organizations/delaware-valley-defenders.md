## Overview

The Delaware Valley Defenders are Philadelphia's original and longest-standing registered superhuman team. As a Registered Superhuman Entity, members are government employees with public identities (accessible through FOIA requests) and legal protections comparable to law enforcement officers. The team's mandate encompasses rapid emergency response, search and rescue, disaster relief, and defense against hostile superhumans.

The DVD represents institutional superheroism in Chum - operating within the system, observing due process, coordinating with law enforcement, and maintaining chain of evidence through dedicated legal counsel. This philosophy contrasts with the more aggressive methods of younger vigilante teams like the Auditors, creating a recurring tension between institutional responsibility and direct action.

The team formerly operated the Young Defenders, a training and mentorship program for teenage superhumans that served as a pipeline for future members. The program was dissolved following the Superhuman Activity Regulation Act in March 2025. The DVD remained Philadelphia's sole registered team until the establishment of Argus Corps under Richardson's political auspices.

## History

The DVD was founded by Professor Franklin (Jeffery Brown), an electricity-based superhuman known for calm, methodical heroism and commitment to mentoring. Under his leadership the team combated dangerous villains including Shrike (Niles Nolan) and established itself as Philadelphia's premier superhero institution.

Professor Franklin was killed circa 2015 while apprehending the radioactive supervillain Chernobyl (Illya Myronovych Fedorov) at an abandoned PES refinery. He was buried at Laurel Hill East cemetery in the heroes and soldiers section near the flagpoles.

Leadership passed to Diane Williams (Liberty Belle, formerly Breakout), Franklin's protege, who brought superhuman strength, enhanced proprioception, and formidable detective skills to the role. She continued the Young Defenders program and recruited Sam Small in August 2023 despite her own terminal cancer diagnosis. Belle maintained an aggressive investigative posture toward the Kingdom of Keys and Chernobyl's government connections, drawing criticism from some who viewed her methods as reckless.

On the first night of Hanukkah in December 2023, Belle confronted Chernobyl at the same refinery where Franklin died. Despite Sam's unauthorized intervention, Belle was fatally wounded, dying in Sam's arms. She was buried beside Franklin at Laurel Hill East.

Multiplex (Elijah Brooks) assumed effective leadership afterward. Where Belle had been charismatic and inspirational, Multiplex brought a philosophy rooted in systems, structure, and discipline. He had been second-in-command and had openly disagreed with Belle's approach, favoring institutional frameworks over charismatic leadership.

In August 2024, the Philly Phreaks attacked outside the courthouse during Chernobyl's trial. The DVD and Young Defenders responded jointly, prompting discussions about graduating Young Defenders to fill gaps. Crossroads was promoted to the DVD, and Rampart assumed Young Defenders leadership.

The team faced a major blow in March 2025 when Richardson's SARA dissolved the Young Defenders. Members scattered: Rampart joined the DVD, Gossamer left heroism before joining the Auditors, and Sam refused to comply. Shortly after, a Kingdom ambush during a prison transport on I-78 left Captain Plasma incapacitated.

By summer 2025, Multiplex began personally training Sam in boxing and tactical combat at DVD HQ. Captain Plasma departed for New York on Kingdom-related intel, then embarked on a federally sponsored tour, further diminishing the local roster.

In fall 2025, Councilman Davis proposed converting the Auditors' Music Hall base into a legitimate community center. The Tacony Community Center opened in early 2026, with Davis and Sam co-leading a pilot mentorship program serving as an alternative to the disbanded Young Defenders model.

Throughout the story, the DVD has maintained a complicated relationship with Sam and the Auditors - simultaneously mentors, allies, authority figures, and occasionally obstacles. Councilman Davis provides political cover and intelligence while Crossroads operates as a key contact between the institutional team and Sam's independent operations.

## Structure

**Leadership:** The team leader serves as field commander and organizational head. The position has passed through three holders: Professor Franklin, Liberty Belle, and Multiplex. The leader coordinates operations, sets priorities, and represents the team to federal agencies and local government.

**Field Operatives:** The core combat roster responds to emergencies, conducts patrols, and engages hostile superhumans. Current operatives include Bulwark, Fury Forge, Crossroads, Rampart, and Captain Plasma (on tour).

**Support Staff:** Nurse Sylvia Moore handles medical care and metahuman rehabilitation. Clarissa Parker serves as legal counsel, ensuring chain of evidence and legal compliance.

**Civilian Liaison:** Councilman Jamal Davis bridges the team and Philadelphia's municipal government, providing political cover, resources, intelligence, and law enforcement coordination.

**Young Defenders (Disbanded):** Former youth training program that mentored teenage superhumans. Members included Sam Small, Jordan Westwood, Lily Chen, Maxwell Martinez, Jason Reynolds, Amelia Li, Jamila Fayad, Connor, Akilah Washington, and Devonte Harris. Dissolved following SARA in March 2025.

## Operations

**Notable Operations and Events:**

- **Shrike Apprehension (pre-story):** Belle and Professor Franklin combined to subdue Shrike (Niles Nolan), who had been terrorizing Strawberry Mansion with metal spike attacks.

- **Chernobyl Trial Security (August 2024):** Provided security during Illya Fedorov's trial and responded to the Philly Phreaks' courthouse attack with search and rescue.
- **Operation Ivory / Zoo Battle (December 2024):** Deployed to the Philadelphia Zoo to counter the Kingdom's rhino theft. Captain Plasma, Multiplex, Fury Forge, and Crossroads engaged Kingdom operatives including Mr. T-Rex. The DVD came to acknowledge Sam's tactical judgment after she identified the attack's true purpose.
- **Three-Day Hostage Situation (February 2025):** Multi-day hostage crisis in West Philadelphia that occupied team resources and delayed response to Aaron McKinley's arson campaign.
- **Aaron McKinley Investigation (February 2025):** Multiplex, Captain Plasma, and Crossroads questioned Sam at the hospital following the school fire. Crossroads used precognition to gather information about Aaron's identity and powers.
- **Prison Transport (March 2025):** Captain Plasma led security for transporting Kingdom prisoners Mr. Nothing and Mudslide. The Kingdom ambushed the convoy on I-78 near Allentown, incapacitating Plasma and liberating both prisoners.
- **Tainted Jump Response (ongoing, 2025):** Bulwark conducted undercover investigations into Rogue Wave's Jump distribution at Temple University, uncovering that the Kingdom was intercepting and tainting Rogue Wave shipments.
- **Shrike Battle (October 2025):** Fury Forge and Bulwark deployed to the Van Kirk construction site supporting Sam's confrontation with the escaped Shrike, after Lily Chen called for backup. Bulwark was critically injured when Shrike broke free from an NSRA containment vehicle while on Hypeman. Fury Forge was also injured.
- **Roxborough Memorial Operation (late 2025):** Responded to an anonymous tip (from Sam) resulting in arrest of 19 individuals including 15 Rogue Wave members, 4 Kingdom operatives, and the high-value target Mr. Polygraph.
- **Bellwether District Raid (early 2026):** Assisted federal authorities raiding a Kingdom drug-cutting operation in South Philadelphia, following intelligence from multiple channels including Sam's EMT work. Sixteen detained, drug equipment seized, along with explosive devices planted separately by the vigilante Marathon.

The DVD also maintains an anonymous tip line used by civilian informants and allied vigilantes - including Sam - to relay intelligence without legally compromising direct contact.

## Trivia

- The HQ's Young Defenders obstacle course was dismantled and packed away after the program's dissolution.
- Fury Forge chose her codename because it sounded cool, not for any thematic connection to her powers.
- Captain Plasma once tacitly approved an unauthorized patrol by Sam and Rampart by asking them to bring him back a turkey sub, which Sam corrected to "hoagie" - the proper Philadelphia term.
- Interlude BA.1 provides a rare look at the adult DVD members discussing team dynamics, recruitment, and the aftermath of Belle and Franklin's deaths without Sam present.
- Bulwark's catchphrase for younger heroes is "young one," and he speaks without compound words due to his Ghanaian speech patterns.
- Legal counsel Clarissa Parker is described as good at finding loopholes and "a little underhanded but for the greater good."
- Monkey Business of Rogue Wave likely anticipated that Sam would tip off the DVD during the Roxborough operation, suggesting the DVD's movements are partially predictable to outside actors.
- Professor Franklin wore a white lab coat over up-to-date Kevlar with fingerless gloves, establishing a distinctive professional aesthetic for the team's founding era.
