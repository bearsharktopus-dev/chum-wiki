## Overview

The Tacony Titans are a team of young metahuman vigilantes in Tacony, Northeast Philadelphia. Described as "the boy scouts of Tacony," they are good-natured but carry internal friction distinguishing them from the more tightly bonded Auditors. They occupy a deliberate tactical niche as the defensive, reactive half of Northeast Philadelphia's vigilante infrastructure, focusing on community patrol, search and rescue, and protective intervention rather than the Auditors' aggressive investigations.

The five-member roster spans ages fifteen to twenty-two. Their headquarters is a nondescript garage - the kind one drives past without noticing. Despite modest operations, the Titans maintain enough local reputation to have had their own fan-made website before any on-page appearance. Where the Auditors hunt, the Titans defend, making their alliance one of the most effective vigilante partnerships in Northeast Philadelphia.

## History

The Titans were active by September 2023, when Sam's school friend Lilly mentioned them during a sleepover, recalling her father had met the team and they had given him pre-packaged food. Marcus Johnson found their NetSphere website - a basic fan-made page with an early-2000s design and 328 visits, listing five members (Bubble, Compass, Weave, Sandman, Sundial) with most entries noting "powers unknown." Weave was later replaced by Moonshot under unknown circumstances.

First on-page contact came when Sam and Jordan encountered Sundial and Bubble intervening in a drunken dispute at Wissinoming Park. Sundial neutralized the threat with martial arts joint locks, catching a thrown bottle mid-flight. Bubble joked that at least the Titans' name did not make them sound like tax accountants; Jordan accused them of stealing the name from the Teen Titans.

Sundial and Moonshot arrived as reinforcements during the Ricochet battle, with Moonshot tackling the villain mid-flight. Afterward, Sundial's personal familiarity with Crossroads was revealed when she asked about his mother, though he shut her down.

Following the Auditors' failed sting on Squeal, Sundial intercepted Sam and proposed a formal alliance, revealing she had been tracking the drug trade independently with her powers and recognized the problem exceeded what either team could handle alone. The alliance's first major joint operation was the Dobson Mills warehouse battle - a week-long stakeout of Squeal's apartment led to following him to a meeting with Sparkplug. Miss Mayfly's unauthorized intervention forced an unplanned confrontation. During the chaos, Sundial was injured and urged Sam to keep fighting despite being locked in place by "causality stuff." Bubble exhausted herself creating force-field bubbles around enemies. Sandman arrived riding on a pre-tranquilized, transformed Derek (Fenrir), controlling the sleeping werewolf's movements. Compass provided the encrypted earpieces both teams used. The operation succeeded with Squeal captured.

Afterward, the three teams convened at the Music Hall. Sundial used a fake precognitive warning to limit Team Mayfly's role, and Moonshot suggested tech support as a compromise. The combined force assaulted Sparkplug's Dorchester building penthouse on May 30th, with Moonshot providing gravity-assisted exterior infiltration and Sandman handling civilian evacuation.

Bubble represented the Titans at a multi-team DVD/Young Defenders briefing during Arc 5, reporting that Sundial's postcognition showed all drug distribution was land-based via trucks. During Arc 6, the Titans fought alongside other teams as the city descended into chaos from the Jump crisis.

In Arc 8, Sundial and Sandman attended a briefing at Devonte's hospital room after he was shot investigating the Kingdom. When Operation Ivory was revealed, Sundial volunteered to reach out to other street teams. In Arc 9, Sandman accompanied Sam to meet Razor, and Sundial introduced Sam to Manta Rei of the Schuylkill Sirens. During the zoo battle, Sundial fought as a blur of movement, reading seconds into the future.

During the Arc 9 arson crisis, Sundial performed psychometric investigation of a burned coffee shop - in full gear (tattered white gi, padded armor, visor-mask), crouching and running fingers near charred edges. She sketched the perpetrator, confirming Aaron McKinley's identity; the sketch was broadcast on the news and the arsons stopped. She also confirmed Aaron's old gang, the Tacony Coyotes, had been killed roughly eighteen months prior in what appeared to be a random drive-by. Sandman took up covert surveillance outside Sam's house disguised as a homeless person, complete with fake beard and a phone loaded with documentaries. When Sam considered violent methods against Aaron, Sandman challenged her darker impulses - countering that pain does not teach lessons and telling her she was "talking like a killer."

In Arc 11, Sundial joined the Auditors on a raid of an abandoned Sunoco station used for Jump distribution. Her psychometry confirmed product codes JMP-R, JMP-B, JMP-G and identified the dealer Marathon. Sam later used the mere threat of Sundial's psychometry as leverage in dealings - the first tactical deployment of the Titans' capabilities as a deterrent without any member present.

In Arc 12, Patriot's "Safer Streets Initiative" offering $500 bounties for reporting powered youth prompted internal debate. Bubble was caught by police on patrol. Sundial proposed coordinating inter-team mutual protection and reaching out to Pattinson's Pals despite ideological differences.

The Titans reported a Shrike sighting in Rhawnhurst during Arc 14 - a tall, thin figure moving "unnaturally fast" that they lost in the train yard.

In Arc 15, Maya Richardson's manufactured blizzard (sixteen inches targeting Northeast Philadelphia) overwhelmed the full Titans roster with search-and-rescue: car accidents, power outages, and medical emergencies. Sundial requested Auditors support, reporting her calls to other agencies were met with "sounds like a local police matter." A joint communication channel was established, with Moonshot assigned to the Cottman corridor, Sandman coordinating from base, and Compass and Bubble handling residential check-ins. During the fifteen simultaneous Kingdom break-ins, the neighborhood deteriorated with intimidation and civilian vigilante clashes. Sundial texted Sam as Lucy, acknowledging the difficulty.

In Arc 16, when Sam gathered intelligence on the Bellwether drug operation, Sundial was the first to respond: "When and where?"

## Structure

Sundial serves as team leader, managing strategy, investigations, and inter-team diplomacy. Sandman functions as second-in-command, handling tactical planning, finances (drawing on his upper-middle-class household), and nighttime security. Bubble, Compass, and Moonshot fill specialized roles without formal rank distinctions. Compass supplements equipment through scavenged and repurposed gadgets from her working-class DIY background.

The team's small size allows direct, informal coordination based on situational demands rather than rigid protocols.

## Trivia

- Sandman and Derek developed a combat arrangement where Sandman rode the pre-tranquilized werewolf, tied around Derek's neck with dreads bouncing as Derek loped. Arranged a week before Dobson Mills.
- Sam was visibly attracted to Sundial during their first meeting at the Titans' garage, internally noting her cheeks heating up before reminding herself she was there to fight crime.
- Compass claimed she had "dumpster-dived behind the NSRA building" for earpiece parts, though Jordan suggested this was a joke.
- Sundial's psychometric sketches are not admissible as evidence in court, but police still call on her for crime scene work.
- On the HIRC metahuman gossip forum, Sundial is apparently the subject of memes.
- Sundial used a fake precognitive warning to scare Team Mayfly into accepting a limited role, claiming all five would get seriously hurt - though Sam suspected this was not how her power actually worked.
- Sundial was also impressed by Team Mayfly's tech, calling it "seriously advanced tech for a bunch of high school kids."
