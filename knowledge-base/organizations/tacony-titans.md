## Overview

The Tacony Titans are a team of young metahuman vigilantes operating out of Tacony in Northeast Philadelphia. Described as "the boy scouts of Tacony," the Titans are good-natured but carry a degree of internal friction that distinguishes them from the more tightly bonded Auditors. They occupy a deliberate tactical niche as the defensive, reactive half of Northeast Philadelphia's vigilante infrastructure, focusing on community patrol, search and rescue, and protective intervention rather than the aggressive, proactive investigations that characterize the Auditors.

The team's five-member roster spans a range of ages from fifteen to twenty-two, with each member filling a distinct operational role. Their headquarters is a nondescript garage in Tacony -- the kind of building one would drive past without noticing -- which contrasts with the Auditors' more expansive Tacony Music Hall and later Community Center. Despite their modest base of operations, the Titans maintain a local reputation significant enough to have warranted their own website listing team members before any on-page appearance. They have proven themselves capable of operating independently on patrol and investigation while also functioning as effective partners in multi-team operations against organized criminal networks.

The Titans' philosophy prioritizes measured, community-focused responses over confrontation. Where the Auditors hunt, the Titans defend. This complementary dynamic has made the alliance between the two teams one of the most effective vigilante partnerships in Northeast Philadelphia, with each group covering the tactical gaps left by the other.

## History

The Tacony Titans were active by at least September 2023, when Sam Small's school friend Lilly mentioned them as a local superhero team her father had encountered. At that time, the team maintained a basic website listing five members: Bubble, Compass, Weave, Sandman, and Sundial. The circumstances of the team's founding and the specific date of its formation are undocumented.

The Titans first appeared on-page in late April 2024, when Sam Small and Jordan Westwood encountered Sundial and Bubble intervening in a drunken dispute at Wissinoming Park during one of Sam's earliest patrols following her hospitalization. Sundial neutralized the threat with an aikido technique, and formal introductions followed. Sam recognized the team name from her earlier conversation with school friends. Sundial suggested that future collaboration could be "mutually beneficial," and the teams parted with cautious optimism about cooperation.

By this time, the team's roster had changed: Weave, who had appeared on the original website listing, was no longer a member and had been replaced by Moonshot.

In early May 2024, following the Auditors' failed sting operation on the drug dealer Squeal, Sundial approached Sam privately and proposed a formal alliance between the two teams. She revealed that the Titans had been independently investigating Philadelphia's growing drug crisis and recognized that the scope of the problem exceeded what either team could handle alone. Sam agreed, and the combined forces began coordinating operations against the Jump distribution network.

The alliance's first major joint operation was the Dobson Mills warehouse battle in mid-May 2024. After a week-long stakeout of Squeal's apartment, the combined teams tracked him to a meeting with Sparkplug at the Dobson Mills warehouse. The operation was disrupted by Miss Mayfly's unauthorized drone intervention, forcing both teams into an unplanned direct confrontation with Squeal, Sparkplug, and their henchmen. During the chaotic battle, Sundial was injured and required protection from Bubble and direct intervention from Sam. Sandman rode on the back of a transformed Derek (Fenrir), controlling the werewolf's movements to incapacitate Squeal. The operation ultimately succeeded, with Squeal captured and Sparkplug's network disrupted.

Following the warehouse battle, the Titans helped devise a cover story to protect Kate Smith's vigilante identity after she was injured during the fight. The three teams -- Auditors, Titans, and Team Mayfly -- subsequently convened at the Tacony Music Hall to negotiate roles and plan the assault on Sparkplug's penthouse. Sundial warned about the risks of unlicensed vigilantism and the inevitability of injuries for unpowered operatives. The combined force successfully assaulted Sparkplug's Dorchester building penthouse in late May 2024, with Moonshot providing exterior access via gravity manipulation and Sandman evacuating civilians alongside Jordan.

The Titans participated in a combined meeting of the Delaware Valley Defenders, Young Defenders, and Tacony Titans during Arc 6, where Bubble reported on the Titans' investigation findings regarding the Rogue Wave threat. The teams debated whether Rogue Wave's goals were profit-driven or ideological.

During Arc 8, Sundial and Sandman attended a briefing at the Tacony Music Hall when intelligence arrived about the Kingdom of Keys' planned zoo heist. Sandman met separately with Sam to discuss strategy ahead of Operation Ivory, and Sundial met with Sam and Manta Rei at a cafe near UPenn to share information about the planned operation.

The Titans played a significant role during the arson crisis of Arc 9 (February 2025). Sundial used her psychometry to investigate a burned coffee shop, providing a detailed description of the perpetrator that confirmed Aaron McKinley's identity. Her sketch of Aaron was broadcast on the news. She offered to have Sandman watch Sam's neighborhood, and Sandman subsequently took up a covert surveillance position disguised as a homeless person outside Sam's house. During the citywide chaos of copycat arsons and civil unrest, Moonshot was observed patrolling from above while Sandman maintained his watch on Sam's street. Sandman engaged Sam in an intense debate about her motivations regarding Aaron, expressing concern about her darker impulses and the line between revenge and justice.

During Arc 10, the Titans assisted with covering neighborhood patrols while Sam was grounded, helping maintain community protection during the Auditors' reduced operational capacity.

In Arc 12 (summer 2025), the Titans faced a new threat when Patriot and Argus Corps announced the "Safer Streets Initiative," offering $500 bounties for reporting powered youth. Bubble was caught by police while on patrol. Sundial arrived at an Auditors training session to warn Sam about the initiative and report that Compass was considering moving operations underground while Sandman had suggested the team stand down entirely. Rather than retreating, Sundial proposed coordinating between hero teams for mutual protection and reaching out to Pattinson's Pals despite ideological differences. Philadelphia was identified during this period as a battleground between three major vigilante factions: the Auditors, the Tacony Titans, and Pattinson's Pals.

The Titans contributed to the broader investigation during the Shrike crisis of Arc 14, reporting a sighting of a tall, thin figure in dark clothes dropping birds, though they lost pursuit.

During Arc 15, Sundial joined Sam, Maggie, and Lily on an infiltration of an abandoned Sunoco station being used for Jump distribution. Her psychometry confirmed the identity of the dealer Marathon and revealed past drug transactions and territorial disputes. When Marathon's crew returned unexpectedly, Sundial demonstrated skilled combat against armed opponents before escaping with Maggie. She later circled back with the team to assist in Sam's extraction after Sam was captured by the ferrokinetic villain Drop. Sam subsequently used the mere threat of Sundial's psychometry to talk Marathon out of bombing the Bellwether drug operation, marking the first tactical use of the Titans' capabilities as leverage without any member being present.

In Arc 15's climax, Maya Richardson used her weather manipulation powers to generate a targeted blizzard that dumped sixteen inches of snow on Northeast Philadelphia while the rest of the city received only six inches. During the resulting power outage, the Kingdom of Keys executed fifteen coordinated commercial break-ins. The entire Titans roster -- Moonshot, Sandman, Compass, and Bubble -- was overwhelmed with search-and-rescue operations and unable to address the break-ins. Sundial arrived at the Auditors to request help with coverage, reporting that local police treated the break-ins as an insurance matter and that federal resources were occupied elsewhere. A joint communication channel was established between the Titans and the Auditors to coordinate the combined response.

## Structure

The Tacony Titans operate with a straightforward chain of command. Sundial serves as team leader, managing strategy, investigations, and inter-team diplomacy. Sandman functions as second-in-command, handling tactical planning, finances, and base security during nighttime hours. The remaining three members -- Bubble, Compass, and Moonshot -- fill specialized operational roles without formal rank distinctions.

The team does not appear to maintain formal divisions or specialized sub-units. Operational decisions flow from Sundial, with Sandman providing tactical counsel and maintaining autonomous authority over nighttime security and intelligence-gathering. The team's small size allows for direct, informal coordination, with members deploying based on the specific demands of each situation rather than adhering to rigid protocols.

Financially, Sandman serves as the team's primary backer, drawing on resources from his upper-middle-class household. Compass supplements the team's equipment through scavenged or repurposed gadgets built from her working-class DIY background.

## Operations

The Tacony Titans' operational philosophy is defined by their defensive, reactive orientation. While the Auditors pursue targets through investigation and aggressive confrontation, the Titans focus on community patrol, protective intervention, and search-and-rescue operations. Their territory encompasses Tacony and surrounding neighborhoods in Northeast Philadelphia, though they have deployed to operations across the broader city when joint actions require it.

Key operations include:

- **Wissinoming Park Intervention (April 2024):** Sundial and Bubble intervened in a drunken dispute, establishing first contact with the Auditors and laying the groundwork for the inter-team alliance.
- **Dobson Mills Warehouse Battle (May 2024):** First major joint operation with the Auditors, targeting Squeal and Sparkplug's drug distribution operation. The battle tested the alliance and demonstrated the teams' ability to coordinate under chaotic conditions despite Miss Mayfly's unauthorized intervention.
- **Sparkplug Penthouse Assault (May 2024):** Combined operation with the Auditors and Team Mayfly to neutralize Sparkplug at his Dorchester building penthouse. Moonshot provided gravity-assisted exterior infiltration while Sandman handled civilian evacuation.
- **Rogue Wave Intelligence Sharing (Arc 6):** Participated in a multi-team briefing with the Delaware Valley Defenders and Young Defenders to assess the Rogue Wave threat. Bubble presented the Titans' investigation findings.
- **Operation Ivory Support (Arc 8):** Coordinated with the Auditors and other teams ahead of the Kingdom of Keys' planned zoo heist, sharing intelligence and participating in pre-operation planning.
- **Arson Crisis Response (Arc 9, February 2025):** Sundial's psychometric investigation of a burned coffee shop confirmed the arsonist's identity. Sandman conducted covert neighborhood surveillance to protect Sam's family. Moonshot and Compass provided patrol and investigative support across the city.
- **Anti-Vigilante Countermeasures (Arc 12):** Coordinated inter-team response to the Safer Streets Initiative's bounty system targeting powered youth. Sundial proposed mutual protection strategies between hero teams.
- **Sunoco Station Infiltration (Arc 15):** Sundial accompanied the Auditors in investigating a Jump distribution point, using psychometry to confirm the dealer Marathon's operations and connections to a larger criminal organization.
- **Blizzard Search and Rescue (Arc 15):** Full team deployed for search-and-rescue operations during Maya Richardson's manufactured blizzard targeting Northeast Philadelphia. Overwhelmed by the scale of the storm, the Titans requested Auditors support and established a joint communication channel.

## Trivia

- The Tacony Titans maintained a basic website listing their members before any on-page appearance. The original roster on the site included Bubble, Compass, Weave, Sandman, and Sundial. Weave was later replaced by Moonshot under unknown circumstances.
- When the Titans visited the Auditors' Tacony Music Hall for a joint planning session, they were visibly impressed by the venue's size and ornate moldings. Sundial remarked to Sam, "Not bad, Bloodhound. You've got style."
- Sandman disguised himself as a homeless person to conduct covert surveillance of Sam's street during the arson crisis, revealing himself only when Sam returned home late at night.
- Sundial was the first person to respond to Sam's intelligence message about the Bellwether drug operation, replying simply with "When and where?"
- The Titans' garage headquarters is described as "the kind you'd drive past a thousand times without ever noticing," deliberately chosen for its inconspicuousness.
- Bubble expressed dislike for Miss Mayfly (whom the Titans called "the mosquito") before Kate Smith's civilian identity was known.
- Sandman and Derek (Fenrir) developed a combat arrangement where Sandman rode on the transformed werewolf's back, controlling Derek's movements through his sleep-manipulation powers. This was arranged a week before the Dobson Mills battle.
- Sam used the threat of Sundial's psychometry to dissuade Marathon from bombing the Bellwether drug site -- the first time the Titans' capabilities were deployed as a tactical deterrent without any member being present.
