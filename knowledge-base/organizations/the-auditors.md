## Overview

The Auditors are an independent, unlicensed vigilante team based in the Tacony and Mayfair neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia. Founded by Sam Small and Jordan Westwood after Liberty Belle's death, the group began as a covert investigative unit targeting the Kingdom of Keys and expanded to encompass general protection of the suburban Northeast Philadelphia corridor, with emphasis on intelligence-gathering and proactive operations.

The Auditors occupy a distinct tactical niche: where the Tacony Titans serve as a defensive, reactive community safety team, the Auditors function as their aggressive mirror - conducting surveillance, infiltrating criminal operations, and directly engaging hostile organizations. Operating without government registration places members in a legally precarious position, particularly after SARA's passage.

As of early 2026, the team operates from the former Tacony Music Hall, now renovated into the Tacony Community Center. The facility serves dual purposes as the Auditors' base and a community resource hosting Councilman Davis's powered youth mentorship program, with Sam and Maggie as peer mentors.

## History

### Origins: Sam and Jordan's Partnership (September-October 2023)

In September 2023, while Sam was still with the Young Defenders, she and Jordan established a base in the abandoned Tacony Music Hall. They conducted independent activities - staging fake fights to build Sam's reputation, investigating the Kingdom, and running an undercover operation at the Crescent nightclub - while Sam simultaneously trained with the Young Defenders. Jordan secured an agreement with the building's property owner and gradually transformed the hall into a functional headquarters with electricity, security locks, and a Faraday cage room.

### Formation of the Auditors (December 2023)

The team formally coalesced after Liberty Belle's death. Sam inherited Belle's detective materials, and Councilman Davis proposed an off-the-books investigation into government complicity with Chernobyl and the Kingdom. Sam, Jordan, and Connor (Spindle) established the Auditors at the Music Hall. They analyzed property records linking shell companies - Harbinger Holdings and Eclipse Enterprises - to both the NSRA and the Kingdom, ultimately tracking Chernobyl to the Arch Street abandoned subway station. The investigation culminated in a confrontation that left Sam hospitalized in a two-week coma with severe radiation exposure. Chernobyl surrendered to authorities the day Sam regained consciousness.

### Expansion and the Vigilante Ecosystem (April-December 2024)

After months of recovery, Sam returned in April 2024 to find Jordan had significantly renovated the facility. Jordan christened the team "the Auditors," reflecting a shift toward being "more sneaky, less smashy." They quickly encountered and allied with the Tacony Titans, with Sundial proposing cooperative arrangements during the Jump and Fly investigation.

The Auditors coordinated multi-team operations against drug distributors Squeal and Sparkplug, working with the Titans and Team Mayfly. Derek Taylor, a werewolf from Sam's civilian support group, began operating alongside the team without formally joining. The year's events - the Pattinson's Pals confrontation, the homecoming dance incident, and Operation Ivory at the Philadelphia Zoo - established the Auditors as a central node in Philadelphia's vigilante network.

### Anti-Vigilante Legislation and Consolidation (March-May 2025)

SARA's passage forced restructuring. The Young Defenders dissolved and members chose paths: Amelia (Gossamer) committed fully to the Auditors as equipment specialist, arriving at the Music Hall with a red scooter, sewing machine, and first aid supplies. Lily (Blink) continued as a field operative. Connor stepped back from active work, his foster family being a personal reason for easing out.

The team's investigation into Tremont & Fairfax, Stheno Pharmaceuticals, and the Kingdom led to infiltrating the Stheno warehouse on Trenton Ave, where Jordan's space-warping bypassed security. The warehouse was destroyed in a chemical explosion by Soot (Kate Smith), acting independently against the Auditors' wishes, eliminating a major drug facility but intensifying government scrutiny.

### Departures and New Leadership (June-October 2025)

The Auditors staged an elaborate operation to fake Soot's vigilante death - Amelia, Lily, and Maggie disguised as a fake villain team called "the Washes" while Sam wore Soot's costume and was thrown into the Delaware River. Kate Smith relocated to Center City under a new identity. Jordan departed for MIT on a full scholarship, and Sam took over the Music Hall lease, assuming full leadership.

The Shrike incident in late September 2025 saw escaped Daedalus inmate Niles Nolan - an antisemitic serial killer with metal spike powers - terrorize Northeast Philadelphia and break into Sam's home. The Auditors coordinated with Rogue Wave for protection during the crisis. Sam confronted Shrike at the Van Kirk construction site; Nolan died from accumulated injuries and Hypeman burnout approximately an hour after hospitalization. The incident prompted Sam to retire the Bloodhound identity. Derek Taylor subsequently assumed the mantle as Bloodhound II.

### Community Center Transition (November 2025-Present)

After the Kingdom sent enforcer "Garbage Day" to destroy the Music Hall's equipment, Councilman Davis proposed converting it into a community center using blueprints by John Horvath (an architect and Pop-pop Moe's former business partner at Horvath-Small Ltd). Davis framed the conversion as legitimizing the Auditors' presence: "A community center with a superhero team isn't a vigilante hideout." The renovation included classrooms, workshops, counseling services, and a proper copper-mesh Faraday cage room. Davis launched a peer mentorship program with Sam and Maggie mentoring four initial students: Zara Khan, Liam O'Connor, Alex Kirby, and Jasmine Walker.

The Tacony Community Center held its grand opening in approximately February 2026, with Davis giving a speech critiquing the child soldier model. The facility has attracted hostile attention from the Songbirds, an anti-superhuman protest group that appeared approximately two weeks after Shrike's death, escalating from protests to coordinated bounties on associated individuals and a baton ambush on Sam.

## Structure

The Auditors operate with a flat, informal hierarchy. Sam serves as de facto leader (formally acknowledged by Jordan before their departure). Tactical decisions are made through group discussion, with Sam holding final authority during field operations.

- **Field operatives**: Sam, Maggie, and Lily serve as the primary field team for patrols, surveillance, and direct engagement.
- **Intelligence and logistics**: Tasha (callsign Lighthouse) provides drone support, police scanner monitoring, and field medicine.
- **Equipment and supply**: Amelia (Gossamer) serves as quartermaster, costume designer, medical supply manager, and designs anomalous whips for field use.
- **Associated operatives**: Derek Taylor (Bloodhound II) operates alongside the team for specific missions but maintains independent status.
- **Remote support**: Jordan contributes intelligence analysis and technical expertise from MIT via digital communication.

## Operations

The Auditors' operational profile has evolved since founding. Core functions:

- **Investigation and surveillance**: Tracking drug networks, undercover infiltrations (Crescent nightclub, Stheno Pharmaceuticals), analyzing financial records and shell companies, monitoring Kingdom and Rogue Wave activity via scanners and informants.
- **Proactive engagement**: Seeking out and confronting threats directly, including the Squeal/Sparkplug sting, the Stheno raid, and the operation to fake Soot's death.
- **Community defense**: Patrols of Tacony and Mayfair, street-level crime intervention, and emergency response.
- **Mentorship**: Sam and Maggie lead peer training sessions at the community center, teaching power control, de-escalation, and safety protocols.
- **Multi-team coordination**: Regular coordination with the Tacony Titans, DVD, and other vigilante groups. Sam serves as a central node connecting multiple factions of Philadelphia's superhuman community.

Notable arc-level operations include the NSRA/Chernobyl investigation (Arc 4), Jump/Fly drug network takedown (Arc 5), Crescent nightclub surveillance (Arc 8), Stheno Pharmaceuticals infiltration (Arc 10), faking Soot's death (Arc 11), Shrike confrontation (Arcs 13-14), and ongoing intelligence operations against the Kingdom and Rogue Wave.
