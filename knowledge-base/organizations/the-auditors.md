## Overview

The Auditors are an independent, unlicensed vigilante team based in the Tacony and Mayfair neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia. Founded by Samantha "Sam" Small and Jordan Westwood in the aftermath of Liberty Belle's death, the group was originally conceived as a covert investigative unit targeting the Kingdom of Keys criminal organization. Over time, the team's mission expanded to encompass the general protection of the suburban Northwest Philadelphia corridor, with a particular emphasis on intelligence-gathering, proactive operations, and confronting threats before they escalate.

The Auditors occupy a distinct tactical niche in Philadelphia's superhuman ecosystem. Where the Tacony Titans serve as a defensive, reactive team focused on community safety and rapid response, the Auditors function as their aggressive, proactive mirror -- conducting surveillance, infiltrating criminal operations, and directly engaging hostile organizations. The team operates without government affiliation or registration, placing its members in a legally precarious position, particularly following the passage of anti-vigilante legislation spearheaded by Councilwoman Maya Richardson.

As of early 2026, the team continues to operate out of the former Tacony Music Hall, which has been renovated into the Tacony Community Center. The facility now serves a dual purpose as both the Auditors' base of operations and a community resource hosting Councilman Jamal Davis's powered youth mentorship program, with Sam and Maggie serving as peer mentors.

## History

### Origins: Sam and Jordan's Partnership (September-October 2023)

The roots of the Auditors trace to the partnership between Sam Small and Jordan Westwood during Sam's early months as a vigilante. In September 2023, while Sam was still affiliated with the Young Defenders, she and Jordan established a base of operations in the abandoned Tacony Music Hall. The two conducted independent vigilante activities -- confronting the Coyotes gang, investigating the Kingdom of Keys, and conducting an undercover operation at the Crescent nightclub -- while Sam simultaneously trained with and fought alongside the Young Defenders. Jordan secured a rental agreement with the building's owner, Mr. Feldman, and gradually transformed the abandoned hall into a functional headquarters with electricity, security locks, a makeshift medical clinic, and a Faraday cage room.

### Formation of the Auditors (December 2023)

The Auditors formally coalesced in the wake of Liberty Belle's death at the hands of Chernobyl. Sam inherited Belle's detective materials and case files, and Councilman Jamal Davis proposed an off-the-books investigation into government complicity with Chernobyl and the Kingdom of Keys. Sam, Jordan, and Connor (Spindle) established the Auditors as an independent investigative team operating from the Tacony Music Hall. During this period, the team analyzed property records linking shell companies to both the NSRA and the Kingdom, discovered surveillance devices in their headquarters, and ultimately tracked Chernobyl to abandoned subway tunnels beneath Philadelphia. The investigation culminated in a brutal confrontation that left Sam hospitalized with severe radiation exposure but resulted in Chernobyl's surrender.

### Expansion and the Vigilante Ecosystem (April-December 2024)

Following Sam's months-long recovery, she returned to the Music Hall in April 2024 to find that Jordan had significantly renovated the facility. Jordan formally christened the team "the Auditors" during this period. The team resumed patrols and quickly encountered the Tacony Titans, a newly formed team of young heroes operating in the same neighborhoods. The two groups established an alliance, with Sundial proposing a cooperative arrangement during the investigation into the Jump and Fly drug distribution network.

The Auditors coordinated multi-team operations against drug distributors Squeal and Sparkplug, working alongside the Tacony Titans and the impromptu vigilante group Team Mayfly. This period also saw the integration of Derek Taylor, a werewolf vigilante from Sam's therapy group, who began operating alongside the team without formally joining. The year's events -- including the confrontation with Pattinson's Pals, the homecoming dance incident, and the discovery of Operation Ivory at the Philadelphia Zoo -- established the Auditors as a central node in Philadelphia's vigilante network.

### Anti-Vigilante Legislation and Consolidation (March-May 2025)

The passage of anti-vigilante legislation banning superhero activities for minors forced the Auditors to restructure. In response to the new legal landscape, Amelia (Gossamer) and Lily (Blink) officially joined the team, bringing equipment expertise and transport capabilities respectively. Connor announced his departure from active vigilante work during this period. The team's investigation into connections between Tremont & Fairfax, Stheno Pharmaceuticals, and the Kingdom of Keys led to a raid on the Stheno warehouse that destroyed a major drug production facility but further intensified government scrutiny.

### Departures and New Leadership (June-October 2025)

The summer of 2025 marked a transitional period. Jordan departed for MIT on a full scholarship, and Kate Smith (Soot) relocated to Center City after the elaborate operation to fake her vigilante death. Sam took over Jordan's lease on the Music Hall and assumed full leadership of the team. During this period, the Auditors adopted a more methodical investigative approach, tracking Jump distribution networks and confronting Rogue Wave operatives. Sam also began training her teammates in boxing behind the Music Hall, and Maggie (Flashpoint) joined as a core field operative.

The Shrike incident in late September 2025 -- in which Sam killed the escaped Daedalus inmate Niles Nolan to protect civilians -- prompted Sam to retire from the Bloodhound identity. Derek Taylor subsequently assumed the mantle as Bloodhound II, receiving Sam's equipment and a new costume from the team.

### Community Center Transition (November 2025-Present)

In October 2025, Councilman Davis proposed converting the Music Hall into a community center, presenting blueprints designed by John Horvath (Pop-pop Moe's business partner). The renovation included a halfway house with beds, classrooms, workshop spaces, and counseling services. Davis simultaneously launched a peer mentorship program for at-risk powered youth, with Sam and Maggie serving as mentors to four initial students: Zara Khan, Liam O'Connor, Alex Kirby, and Jasmine Walker.

The Tacony Community Center held its grand opening in approximately February 2026. The facility now serves as both the Auditors' operational base and a legitimate community institution, though the transition has attracted hostile attention from the Songbirds, an anti-superhuman protest group that has targeted the center and its volunteers.

## Structure

The Auditors operate with a flat, informal hierarchy rather than a rigid chain of command. Sam Small serves as the de facto leader, a role formally acknowledged by Jordan before their departure to MIT. Tactical decisions are typically made through group discussion, though Sam holds final authority during field operations.

The team's operational structure reflects its investigative origins:

- **Field operatives** conduct patrols, surveillance, and direct engagement with hostile forces. Sam, Maggie, and Lily serve as the primary field team.
- **Intelligence and logistics** are handled by Tasha (callsign Lighthouse), who provides drone support, police scanner monitoring, and field medicine from a support position.
- **Equipment and supply** fall under Amelia (Gossamer), who serves as the team's quartermaster, costume designer, and medical supply manager. She also designs and maintains anomalous whips for field use.
- **Associated operatives** such as Derek Taylor (Bloodhound II) operate alongside the team for specific missions but maintain independent status.
- **Remote support** is provided by Jordan from MIT, who contributes intelligence analysis and technical expertise via digital communication.

The team maintains a Faraday cage room within the community center for secure planning sessions and stores equipment and supplies on site.

## Operations

The Auditors' operational profile has evolved significantly since the team's founding. Initially focused on intelligence-gathering against the Kingdom of Keys, the team has expanded to encompass a range of activities:

- **Investigation and surveillance**: The team's primary function. Operations include tracking drug distribution networks, conducting undercover infiltrations (such as the Crescent nightclub and Stheno Pharmaceuticals), analyzing financial records and shell company structures, and monitoring Kingdom and Rogue Wave activity via police scanners and informant networks.
- **Proactive engagement**: Unlike the defensive posture of the Tacony Titans, the Auditors seek out and confront threats directly. Notable operations include the sting operation against Squeal and Sparkplug, the Stheno warehouse raid, and the coordination of the elaborate plan to fake Soot's death.
- **Community defense**: Patrols of the Tacony and Mayfair neighborhoods, intervention in street-level crime, and response to emergencies in their operational area.
- **Mentorship**: Sam and Maggie lead peer training sessions for powered youth at the community center, teaching power control, de-escalation, and safety protocols.
- **Multi-team coordination**: The Auditors regularly coordinate with the Tacony Titans, the Delaware Valley Defenders, and other vigilante groups. Sam has served as a central node connecting multiple factions of Philadelphia's superhuman community.

Notable operations include the NSRA/Chernobyl investigation (Arc 4), the Jump/Fly drug network takedown (Arc 5), the Stheno Pharmaceuticals raid (Arc 10), the faking of Soot's death (Arc 11), the Shrike confrontation (Arc 13), and ongoing intelligence operations against the Kingdom of Keys and Rogue Wave.
