## Overview

The Philly Phreaks were a small gang of metahuman teenagers and young adults in South Philadelphia, composed primarily of visually-apparent metahumans - individuals whose powers had drastically altered their appearance, making it impossible to blend into civilian life. Led by Amira Irshad (Patches), the group provided a surrogate family for young metahumans rejected by their biological families. Beneath the criminal activity, the Phreaks functioned as a makeshift support network for marginalized superpowered youth.

Criminal activities escalated after the Kingdom of Keys began threatening and manipulating the Phreaks into more aggressive operations. The Kingdom "gifted" Daisy Zhen (Deathgirl), a child weapon created by Project Hollywood, to the group as a force multiplier. This culminated in a devastating terrorist attack on the Philadelphia federal courthouse during Chernobyl's trial.

Following the courthouse attack, the Phreaks were effectively disbanded. Most members were incarcerated at Daedalus Correctional Facility, while Spindle had already defected to the heroes and Chimera moved on to Rogue Wave.

## History

### Formation and Early Activity

The Phreaks coalesced around Patches, a nineteen-year-old whose extraordinary regenerative abilities left her with a patchwork of red and white scars. She served as leader and surrogate mother to the group's younger members. The group engaged in low-level criminal activity in South Philadelphia and had a reputation as nuisance-level criminals. Playback had a pre-powers personal history with Patches, though the full nature of this connection has not been revealed.

### Kingdom of Keys Manipulation

The Phreaks' behavior escalated after Kingdom operatives Mr. T-Rex and Mr. Nothing (as identified by Spindle during interrogation) approached the gang and began threatening members into aggressive conduct. Most significantly, the Kingdom "gifted" Deathgirl to the Phreaks through Mrs. Zenith's orchestration. Daisy had been kidnapped by Project Hollywood, which targeted children from immigrant, poor, and transient families to condition them into weapons through artificially triggered activation events. Patches manipulated Daisy by feeding her disinformation about the heroes.

### South Street Confrontation (Arc 3)

The Phreaks' first major confrontation occurred on South Street in late autumn 2023. The DVD received an anonymous tip (later traced to Spindle). The Young Defenders were dispatched as a more age-appropriate response, since sending adult heroes against disadvantaged teens would have created negative publicity.

The Young Defenders found four Phreaks eating donuts atop a rusty car on the evacuated street. Patches unveiled Deathgirl as their "secret weapon," manipulating her into believing Playback worked for the people who took her parents. Deathgirl unleashed a devastating sonic attack and continuously copied surrounding powers. Spindle betrayed his team, using Sam's stolen adhesive spray to blind Pumice, turning the tide. Chrysalis called retreat; she and Pumice fled. Deathgirl escaped through a storm drain. Patches was restrained and taken into custody. Spindle cooperated fully during interrogation, revealing the Kingdom's involvement; Patches refused to speak without a lawyer.

### Alliance with Aaron McKinley (Arc 4)

With Patches incarcerated, the remaining Phreaks fell into disarray. Aaron McKinley, a fire-powered villain, attempted to assume leadership. Under Aaron, the Phreaks ambushed Sam, attacking her with a crowbar and assisting in her kidnapping and torture. Sam discovered the ability to grow teeth from her knuckles and wrists during captivity and escaped. Chrysalis subsequently led the Phreaks in severing ties with Aaron, dismantling his failed leadership.

### Tainted Jump Campaign (Arc 6)

In the lead-up to Chernobyl's trial, the Phreaks became involved in distributing tainted Jump. Working alongside Chimera, they escalated to coordinated destabilization. The Phreaks hoarded Jump and Fly without using it themselves - strategic stockpiling that alarmed heroes. They distributed bad Jump mixed randomly with pharmacy drugs, with no quality control. The DVD identified their involvement after four simultaneous Jump incidents across Philadelphia, with Deathgirl, Chrysalis, and Pumice confirmed present.

### The Courthouse Attack (Arc 6)

The Phreaks' most devastating action came during Chernobyl's trial in August 2024. After explosive testimony from NSRA Special Agent Evelyn Shaw revealed the agency had been enabling Chernobyl, a massive protest erupted outside. The Phreaks force-fed tainted Jump to protesters, causing violent mutations and mass chaos - victims experienced extra eyes, faces sloughing off, and limbs erupting with new growths.

Deathgirl, perched on Pumice's back wearing a battered Burger King crown, announced the attack as revenge for Patches's arrest, styling herself as a "Demon Lord." Pumice waded through the crowd impervious to rubber bullets and tear gas. Chimera tore into riot squads with animal-hybrid limbs. Sam ultimately overpowered Deathgirl in an exhausting one-on-one on the courthouse steps, pinning and restraining her. Chrysalis was subdued by Rampart. Chimera participated but went missing afterward. Spindle, now fighting alongside heroes, joined Playback in confronting Pumice with assistance from Gale (Jamila Fayad), who intervened anonymously in biker gear.

### Aftermath and Dissolution

The captured Phreaks - Deathgirl, Pumice, and Chrysalis - were sedated and transported to Daedalus. In September 2025, the Kingdom and Red Calf orchestrated a prison break to extract Deathgirl. She woke prematurely, copied surrounding powers, and escaped into lower mining tunnels. With help from Cold-Cut, a fellow escapee, she reached Albany by bus, where her parents had relocated. Through an emergency hearing before Judge Esposito, she was transferred to the Whitford Institute in Chicago - the country's only psychiatric facility specialized for powered youth.

Spindle had already defected during South Street and became a founding member of the Auditors. He eventually moved to Bucks County with an adoptive family, completed his GED, and entered a long-distance relationship with Jordan Westwood. Chimera drifted into Rogue Wave.

## Structure

The Phreaks operated with a loose, familial hierarchy. Patches functioned as unquestioned leader and surrogate maternal figure. Remaining members were roughly co-equal, with cohesion rooted in shared marginalization rather than organizational structure.

After Patches's arrest, the group lacked stable leadership. Aaron McKinley's attempt to fill the vacuum was rejected. Subsequent operations were driven primarily by Deathgirl's desire for revenge and Chimera's drug trade involvement.

## Operations

The Phreaks' operations evolved in three phases: low-level survival crimes in South Philadelphia; Kingdom-influenced escalation culminating in the South Street battle; and outright terrorism through tainted Jump distribution and the courthouse attack.

Key operations:

- **South Street Attack** - Planned confrontation revealing Deathgirl as secret weapon. Ended in Patches's capture and Spindle's defection.
- **Kidnapping of Bloodhound** - Alliance with Aaron McKinley to ambush and torture Sam Small. Sam escaped; the Phreaks subsequently abandoned Aaron.
- **Tainted Jump Campaign** - Distribution of tainted Jump across Philadelphia in mid-2024, causing overdoses and violent mutations. Four simultaneous incidents confirmed.
- **Courthouse Attack** - Assault on the federal courthouse during Chernobyl's trial, force-feeding tainted Jump to protesters. Mass casualties. Resulted in capture of Deathgirl, Pumice, and Chrysalis.

| Project Hollywood | Origin of Deathgirl; the covert program that created her before she was placed with the Phreaks |

## Trivia

- Playback may have had a romantic history with Patches. Liberty Belle referred to Amira as Playback's "old beau," and Patches specifically demanded Devonte's presence during questioning, saying she trusted him not to lie.
- During the South Street battle, Pumice wore an Allen Iverson jersey and briefly chatted with Sam about basketball before fighting began.
- The Chernobyl interstice during the courthouse attack revealed that if Fedorov had joined the battle, Deathgirl could have copied his nuclear powers and become a walking meltdown threatening the city.
- Deathgirl's Daedalus cell contained a penguin plushie named "Mr. Waddles," books about birds, penguins, and dinosaurs, family photos, a journal, and a blanket - indicating genuine rehabilitation progress before the prison break.
- Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) gained her force-field powers after being caught in the courthouse attack, making the Phreaks indirectly responsible for creating a future hero.
- Mr. Antithesis privately acknowledged responsibility for the courthouse attack (Antithesis to Mrs. Zenith to Deathgirl to the Phreaks) and quietly funded victim treatment at the William J. Hofmann Memorial Recovery Ward at Jefferson Hospital.
- Following dissolution, new gangs attempted to claim the Phreaks' territory - "regular thugs with delusions of grandeur and a couple of Jumpheads."
