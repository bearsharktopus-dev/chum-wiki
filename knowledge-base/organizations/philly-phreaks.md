## Overview

The Philly Phreaks were a small gang of metahuman teenagers and young adults based in South Philadelphia, composed primarily of visually-apparent metahumans -- individuals whose powers had drastically altered their physical appearance, making it impossible for them to blend into civilian life. Led by Amira Irshad (Patches), the group provided a surrogate family structure for young metahumans who had been rejected by their biological families or had nowhere else to turn. Beneath the criminal activity, the Phreaks functioned as a makeshift support network for marginalized superpowered youth.

The group's criminal activities escalated significantly after they came under the influence of the Kingdom of Keys, a powerful organized crime syndicate that threatened and manipulated the Phreaks into more aggressive operations. The Kingdom "gifted" Daisy Zhen (Deathgirl), a child weapon created by the shadowy Project Hollywood program, to the Phreaks as a force multiplier. This escalation culminated in two major confrontations with the Delaware Valley Defenders' Young Defenders team and ultimately a devastating terrorist attack on the Philadelphia federal courthouse during the trial of the radioactive supervillain Chernobyl.

Following the courthouse attack, the Philly Phreaks were effectively disbanded. Most members were incarcerated at Daedalus Correctional Facility in upstate New York, while one member (Connor/Spindle) had already defected to the heroes' side and another (Elias Franklin/Chimera) moved on to the criminal organization Rogue Wave.

## History

### Formation and Early Activity

The Philly Phreaks coalesced around Amira Irshad (Patches), a woman in her mid-twenties whose extraordinary regenerative abilities had left her with a "frankensteined" appearance. Patches served as both leader and surrogate mother figure to the group's younger members, many of whom had been disowned, abused, or otherwise cast out due to their visible mutations. The group operated in South Philadelphia, engaging in low-level criminal activity typical of metahuman street gangs. Members included Joseph Jones (Pumice), a stone-bodied young man; Angela Perez (Chrysalis), an insectoid teenager who had been shot by her own father; and Connor (Spindle), a hypercontortionist.

Prior to their first appearance in the story, the Phreaks had a reputation as nuisance-level criminals. Playback, a member of the Young Defenders, had a personal history with Patches from before either had gained powers, though the full nature of this connection has not been revealed.

### Kingdom of Keys Manipulation

The Phreaks' behavior escalated after the Kingdom of Keys began exerting influence over the group. Two Kingdom operatives, identified by Sam Small as Mr. T-Rex and Mr. Nothing, approached the gang and began threatening its members into increasingly aggressive criminal conduct. Most significantly, the Kingdom "gifted" Daisy Zhen (Deathgirl) to the Phreaks. Daisy was a thirteen-year-old girl who had been kidnapped at age seven by Project Hollywood, a covert program that mass-abducted marginalized children to condition them into human weapons ("tykebombs"). The Kingdom intended for the Phreaks to weaponize Daisy's anger-based power-copying ability, and Patches manipulated the emotionally vulnerable girl by feeding her disinformation about the heroes.

### South Street Confrontation (Arc 3)

The Phreaks' first major confrontation with heroes occurred on South Street in late autumn 2023. The Delaware Valley Defenders received an anonymous tip -- later traced to Spindle -- warning of a planned Phreak attack. The Young Defenders were dispatched as a more age-appropriate response team, as sending adult heroes against disadvantaged metahuman teens would have created negative publicity.

The confrontation began when the Young Defenders found four Phreaks eating donuts atop an abandoned car on the evacuated street. Patches unveiled Deathgirl as the group's "secret weapon," manipulating the girl into believing that Playback worked for the people who had taken her parents away. Deathgirl unleashed a devastating sonic attack, and the ensuing battle saw her continuously copying and amplifying the powers of those around her -- including sound manipulation, wind control, regeneration, and insectoid physiology.

The tide turned when Spindle betrayed his team. He used Sam Small's stolen adhesive spray to blind Pumice, allowing the Young Defenders to gain the upper hand. Chrysalis called for retreat, and she and Pumice fled. Deathgirl transformed her body to escape through a storm drain. Sam, Puppeteer, and Spindle successfully restrained Patches, who was taken into custody. During subsequent interrogation, Spindle cooperated fully and revealed the Kingdom's involvement, while Patches refused to speak without a lawyer.

### Alliance with Aaron McKinley (Arc 5)

With Patches incarcerated, the remaining Phreaks fell into disarray. Aaron McKinley, a fire-powered villain, attempted to assume leadership of the group. Under Aaron's direction, the Phreaks ambushed Sam Small, with Aaron attacking her with a crowbar and the group assisting in her kidnapping and torture. During her captivity, Sam was assaulted by Aaron, Pumice, Deathgirl, and Chrysalis. Sam discovered the ability to grow teeth from her knuckles and wrists during this ordeal and ultimately escaped.

Following Sam's escape, Chrysalis led the Phreaks in severing ties with Aaron, verbally dismantling his failed leadership and abandoning him.

### Distribution of Tainted Jump (Arc 6)

In the lead-up to the trial of Illya Fedorov (Chernobyl), the Phreaks became involved in distributing tainted versions of Jump, a temporary power-enhancing drug. Working alongside Elias Franklin (Chimera), a biochemist and wheelchair user who had taken the permanent power drug Fly to gain animal-transformation abilities, the Phreaks escalated from street crime to a coordinated campaign of destabilization. The Delaware Valley Defenders identified the Phreaks' suspected involvement in the surge of Jump overdoses and mutated drug users.

### The Courthouse Attack (Arc 6)

The Phreaks' most devastating action was their attack on the Philadelphia federal courthouse during Chernobyl's trial in August 2024. Following explosive testimony from NSRA Special Agent Evelyn Shaw revealing that the agency had been enabling Chernobyl's crimes, a massive protest erupted outside the courthouse. The Phreaks arrived and distributed tainted Jump to the crowd, causing violent mutations and mass chaos among the protesters.

Deathgirl, riding atop Pumice's shoulders, announced the attack as revenge for Patches's arrest. Pumice focused on causing maximum civilian damage while Deathgirl engaged Sam Small in a prolonged, brutal fight on the courthouse steps. Spindle, now fighting alongside the heroes, joined Playback and Gale in subduing Pumice. Sam ultimately overpowered Deathgirl in an exhausting one-on-one confrontation, pinning the sobbing girl to the ground and restraining her with heavy-duty zip ties.

Chrysalis fought Rampart and was also subdued. Chimera participated in the attack but later separated from the group entirely. In the aftermath, the captured Phreaks -- Deathgirl, Pumice, and Chrysalis -- were sedated and transported to Daedalus Correctional Facility. The attack was a pivotal event in the story, causing significant civilian casualties and directly triggering Maggie O'Brien's metahuman activation, as she gained her force-field powers after being caught in the chaos.

### Aftermath and Dissolution

Following the courthouse attack, the Philly Phreaks ceased to exist as a functioning organization. Patches remained in Daedalus, having been incarcerated roughly a year before the courthouse attack. Pumice and Chrysalis were sent to Daedalus for the courthouse attack. Deathgirl was also imprisoned at Daedalus, where she began responding positively to therapy and rehabilitation.

In September 2025 (Arc 13), the Kingdom of Keys and the mercenary group Red Calf orchestrated a prison break at Daedalus to extract Deathgirl, viewing her as a valuable asset. Porcelain, Red Calf's leader, contracted the Kingdom to carry out the operation. The extraction team tunneled beneath the facility and reached Daisy's cell, but she woke prematurely from sedation and escaped using copied powers, fleeing into the lower tunnels. Daisy made her way to Albany, where her parents had relocated to be near her, and through an emergency legal hearing was transferred to the Whitford Institute in Chicago -- the country's only psychiatric facility specialized for powered youth.

Spindle had already defected during the South Street battle and subsequently became a founding member of the Auditors. He eventually moved to Bucks County with an adoptive family, completed his GED, and entered a long-distance relationship with Jordan Westwood. Chimera drifted into Rogue Wave, a separate criminal organization focused on distributing power-enhancing drugs.

## Structure

The Philly Phreaks operated with a loose, familial hierarchy rather than a formal chain of command. Patches functioned as the unquestioned leader and surrogate maternal figure. The remaining members were roughly co-equal, with no clearly defined ranks or roles beyond their individual combat capabilities. The group's cohesion was rooted in shared marginalization as visually-apparent metahumans rather than any organizational structure.

After Patches's arrest, the group lacked stable leadership. Aaron McKinley's attempt to fill the vacuum was rejected by the remaining members, and subsequent operations during Arc 6 appeared to be driven primarily by Deathgirl's desire for revenge and Chimera's involvement in the drug trade.

## Operations

The Phreaks' operations evolved in three distinct phases. Initially, they were a low-level street gang engaged in petty crime and territorial disputes in South Philadelphia, largely regarded as a nuisance by the Delaware Valley Defenders. Their second phase began under Kingdom of Keys influence, marked by the acquisition of Deathgirl and increasingly aggressive, confrontational behavior culminating in the South Street battle. The third and final phase saw the group acting as outright terrorists, distributing tainted drugs and launching the courthouse attack.

Key operations included:

- **South Street Attack** -- A planned confrontation on South Street in late autumn 2023, where the Phreaks revealed Deathgirl as their secret weapon. Ended in Patches's capture and Spindle's defection.
- **Kidnapping of Bloodhound** -- Alliance with Aaron McKinley to ambush and torture Sam Small. Sam escaped; the Phreaks subsequently abandoned Aaron.
- **Tainted Jump Distribution** -- Distribution of mutated Jump doses across Philadelphia in mid-2024, causing overdoses and violent mutations among users.
- **Courthouse Attack** -- An assault on the federal courthouse during Chernobyl's trial, distributing tainted Jump to protesters and causing mass casualties. Resulted in the capture and incarceration of Deathgirl, Pumice, and Chrysalis.

## Trivia

- The Phreaks were described as "visually-apparent metahumans," meaning their powers had physically altered their appearances in ways that prevented them from passing as baseline humans.
- Playback (Devonte), a Young Defender, had a pre-powers personal history with Patches. He called her by her real name, Amira, during their South Street confrontation. The full nature of their connection remains unexplored.
- During the South Street battle, Pumice wore an Allen Iverson jersey and briefly chatted with Sam about basketball before the fighting began.
- Spindle placed the anonymous tip that warned the Delaware Valley Defenders about the South Street attack before it happened. Sam recognized his discomfort during the standoff and connected him to the tip.
- The Chernobyl interstice during the courthouse attack revealed that if Illya Fedorov had joined the battle, Deathgirl could have copied his nuclear powers and become a walking meltdown threatening the entire city.
- Deathgirl's personal items in her Daedalus cell -- a penguin plushie named "Mr. Waddles," books, and family photos -- indicated that her rehabilitation was making genuine progress before the prison break interrupted it.
- Chimera (Elias Franklin) is listed in both the Philly Phreaks and Rogue Wave in the character reference guide, reflecting his transition between the two organizations.
- Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) gained her force-field powers after being caught in the courthouse attack, making the Phreaks indirectly responsible for the creation of a future hero.
