## Overview

Argus Corps is a four-member registered superhuman team established by Philadelphia Councilwoman Maya Richardson as a proactive security force tasked with combating the city's escalating metahuman crime wave. Publicly framed as a "rehabilitation and redemption" initiative, the team consists of superheroes whose careers were damaged by scandal, legal trouble, or personal disgrace. Richardson positioned the team as the aggressive, offensive complement to the Delaware Valley Defenders' defensive posture -- going after drug labs, criminal warehouses, and crime lords rather than waiting for emergencies.

What the members of Argus Corps were not told is that Richardson selected them precisely because of their disgrace, not in spite of it. Their tarnished reputations function as both leash and carrot: the threat of losing their restored legitimacy keeps them compliant, while the promise of redemption keeps them motivated. In reality, the team serves as the personal attack dogs of Mrs. Zenith, Richardson's secret identity within the Kingdom of Keys, where she holds the position of third-in-command. Through Argus Corps, Richardson gained a legally sanctioned paramilitary force that could pursue her enemies -- particularly the vigilante Bloodhound and her allies -- under the cover of law enforcement.

The team's internal cohesion has deteriorated significantly since a conversation with Bulldozer (Sean McNulty, former leader of Pattinson's Pals) prompted all four members to question whether Richardson might be connected to the Kingdom of Keys. As of early 2026, three separate and mutually unaware investigations into Richardson are being conducted from within the team's own ranks.

## History

### Pattinson's Pals and Patriot's Prior Career (2017--2024)

Before Argus Corps existed, its future leader Richard Johnson operated as the vigilante Patriot, heading a group called Pattinson's Pals in South Philadelphia. The Pals positioned themselves as defenders of law and order but frequently engaged in racist and oppressive tactics. During Arc 7 (September--October 2024), Patriot clashed repeatedly with Sam Small, culminating in a brutal attack on her at the Tacony Charter Academy homecoming dance and a violent one-on-one confrontation on Halloween night in an abandoned warehouse. Sam negotiated a temporary truce using evidence of Egalitarian's drug use and intelligence about Project Titan, a secret military superhuman program in which Patriot had participated.

After Patriot's departure from the Pals to join Argus Corps, leadership of Pattinson's Pals passed to Sean "Bulldozer" McNulty.

### Formation (April 2025)

The creation of Argus Corps was precipitated by a series of escalating crises in Philadelphia: a 54% increase in metahuman crimes over two years, the emergence of Rogue Wave as a major criminal threat, and Rogue Wave's dramatic hijacking of NBC10 and the emergency alert system to declare war on the Kingdom of Keys. Richardson seized on the public panic to propose a new government-backed superhero team.

Richardson personally recruited all four members at a rented coworking space (depicted in Interlude MR.4). She tailored her pitch to each recruit's vulnerabilities: appealing to Patriot's desire for order and American values, to Miasma's pragmatism and desire to combat the Jump epidemic, to Turbo Jett's need to rebuild her tarnished reputation, and to Captain Devil's yearning for redemption after accidentally killing a civilian. The recruits were skeptical but ultimately accepted.

The team's legal framework was established through a confidential internal proposal (Interlude MR.5), reviewed by Katherine Huang of Tremont & Fairfax -- the same law firm later discovered to have connections to the Kingdom of Keys. The proposal outlined authority including detention powers, body camera mandates, civilian oversight, and regular NSRA reporting. It projected a 50% reduction in gang activity within the first year.

Richardson announced the team's formation at a public press conference in late April 2025, framing the initiative as a war against criminal organizations and emphasizing "preemptive deterrence."

### Early Operations (May 2025)

Argus Corps' first major operation was the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse confrontation, where the team arrived at a Kingdom-owned facility on Trenton Avenue during a chaotic three-way encounter involving the Auditors, Soot, and Kingdom enforcers Bash and Lenny. The team arrived without police backup or sirens -- an off-the-books operation. Patriot ordered the team to "detain the capes" and "get the civvies out." During the confrontation, Patriot pursued Sam up a metal staircase and crushed her ankle before Jordan severed the staircase beneath him. The warehouse was ultimately destroyed by a chemical chain reaction triggered by Soot, and the Auditors escaped.

### The Safer Streets Initiative (Summer 2025)

During Arc 12, Patriot announced the Safer Streets Initiative on Fox News, offering $500 rewards for reporting "dangerous youth activities" -- effectively placing bounties on underage heroes. The initiative used coded language but clearly targeted powered teenagers, forcing several vigilante groups to consider going underground or standing down entirely. The bounty system created pervasive paranoia among Philadelphia's young superhuman community.

### Bulldozer's Warning and Internal Fracturing (July 2025)

After Sam met with Bulldozer at Patty's Bar and presented evidence of Richardson's Kingdom connections, Bulldozer investigated independently and then relayed his findings to Patriot. Patriot confronted Richardson at City Hall, but she laughed off the allegations with plausible explanations. He then briefed the team, which produced mixed reactions -- Turbo Jett dismissed the claims, while Captain Devil expressed quiet concern. Privately, Miasma warned Patriot to be careful with Richardson, suggesting she might retaliate. This conversation seeded doubt across the entire team, leading to the current state of three parallel internal investigations.

### Warrant Pursuit of Sam Small (January 2026)

After the Kingdom deployed shapeshifter Elena Morales (Mrs. Doppelganger / "Alice") to impersonate Sam as Bloodhound and commit crimes in her name, Argus Corps was issued a warrant for Sam's arrest on charges of unlicensed vigilantism, breaking and entering, stalking, and reckless endangerment. Patriot and Turbo Jett confronted Sam on January 3rd as she walked home. Sam fled rather than submit to Patriot's custody given their violent history. During the chase, Turbo Jett demonstrated her gear-shifting abilities up to Gear 3, and Jett revealed a somewhat playful personality. Sam's parents emerged to confront the agents, but Patriot insisted on custody. Miasma facilitated Sam's escape by directing her to a safehouse while filing a false radio report that he was in pursuit.

### The Elena Morales Operation (February 2026)

Sam and Amelia, operating under the villain personas "Remora" and "Stingray," intercepted Alice-as-Maya during a constituent outreach event protected by Argus Corps. The operation exploited the team's protective instincts: while Patriot fought Amelia and Turbo Jett chased decoy canisters, Captain Devil and Miasma evacuated "Maya" to an unmarked car -- placing Alice directly in Miasma's custody. At a Fishtown safehouse, Miasma interrogated Elena Morales, who confessed to impersonating Maya Richardson (though she falsely blamed Rogue Wave rather than the Kingdom). The confession broke Richardson's alibi machine.

## Structure

Argus Corps operates as a Registered Superhuman Entity Organization under NSRA Special Directive 14-B, with Councilwoman Maya Richardson serving as political overseer and Patriot functioning as field leader. The team's legal framework grants members detention powers but not arrest powers. Operations are nominally subject to civilian oversight, mandatory body camera use, and regular NSRA reporting, though the team has been observed conducting off-the-books operations without police support.

The team is supported by legal counsel from Tremont & Fairfax, specifically Katherine Huang -- the same attorney who represented Kingdom-connected defendant Aaron McKinley. The team maintains multiple facilities in Philadelphia, including a headquarters with a weight room and underground training facility, and at least one safehouse in Fishtown registered under a shell company.

In practice, Richardson exercises near-total control over the team's operations, using her political authority and their dependence on her for legitimacy. However, this control has begun to erode as internal doubts about her motives have spread.

### Internal Investigations

As of the beginning of Arc 16, three separate investigations into Maya Richardson are being conducted by Argus Corps members, none of whom are aware of the others' efforts:

- **Patriot** is secretly investigating Maya alone, telling no one -- not even his teammates. He has come to believe that even if she is not Kingdom, she is a reckless politician who needs to be removed from power. He is considering a coup (internally characterized as a "Starscream" maneuver).
- **Turbo Jett and Captain Devil** are investigating together on the down low. Captain Devil believes Bulldozer's claims about Richardson's Kingdom connections, while Turbo Jett's doubts have grown after multiple confrontations with Sam challenged her assumptions. Both are uncertain whom to trust.
- **Miasma** is a confirmed mole who has been working with Sam Small since the team's formation. He knows that Maya Richardson is Mrs. Zenith of the Kingdom of Keys and has been actively undermining Kingdom operations from within Argus Corps, including facilitating Sam's escape from the warrant pursuit and capturing Elena Morales for interrogation.

## Operations

Argus Corps is tasked with proactive threat neutralization, with a stated focus on disrupting Jump and Fly drug distribution networks and combating superhuman criminal organizations. In practice, the team's operations have included:

- **Anti-vigilante enforcement**: The Safer Streets Initiative placed $500 bounties on powered youth, and the team has pursued warrants against unlicensed vigilantes, particularly Sam Small.
- **Drug operation raids**: The team was assigned to strike Rogue Wave distribution points and Kingdom-connected targets, though these operations often serve Richardson's political visibility strategy (described by Crossroads as keeping Argus Corps "visible, not just busy").
- **Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse confrontation** (May 2025): Off-the-books intervention at a Kingdom facility, resulting in a multi-sided battle with the Auditors, Soot, and Kingdom enforcers.
- **Rogue Wave marina brawl** (April 2025): Patriot and Turbo Jett intervened violently in a chaotic fight at a Rogue Wave distribution event, escalating the situation. Patriot used a civilian hostage as a human shield to neutralize Blink's sniper fire.
- **Town Hall security** (August 2025): Captain Devil was deployed to provide security at Richardson's town hall event, where he pursued Sam through City Hall before she and Maggie escaped.
- **Armored transport protection**: The team was assigned to protect armored transports of unknown cargo for the Kingdom.
- **Warrant pursuit of Sam Small** (January 2026): Patriot and Turbo Jett attempted to arrest Sam on fabricated charges generated by the Kingdom's shapeshifter.
- **Elena Morales extraction** (February 2026): Argus Corps unknowingly facilitated the capture of Elena Morales when Miasma and Captain Devil evacuated the disguised shapeshifter to Miasma's custody during a staged villain attack.

## Relationships

| Pattinson's Pals | Predecessor organization to Patriot's involvement; Bulldozer serves as an informal back-channel contact |
| Rogue Wave | Declared enemy; Argus Corps raids Rogue Wave distribution points, though these operations may serve Richardson's PR strategy |

## Trivia

- The name "Argus" references Argus Panoptes, the hundred-eyed giant of Greek mythology -- an ironic choice for a team whose overseer is hiding the biggest secrets.
- Turbo Jett serves as the team's de facto PR person because she is attractive and the team lacks a dedicated PR staff.
- Captain Devil's costume -- domino mask, big red scarf, and red beret -- is deliberately styled after Kamen Rider, a Japanese tokusatsu franchise that remains obscure in the story's timeline.
- Miasma has maintained at least four safehouses in Philadelphia and six in Boston throughout his time on the team, using them to support his covert operations against the Kingdom.
- Sam internally compared Argus Corps to "fighting dogs on spiked collars controlled by gamblers," recognizing Maya as "the one holding the leash."
- Turbo Jett let Sam escape after Sam rescued a civilian and a cat from a burning building, prompting Sam to ask her, "Are you a superhero or not, Jett?" -- a question that continues to haunt Jett.
- The team's legal paperwork was prepared by Katherine Huang of Tremont & Fairfax, the same attorney who defended Kingdom-connected arsonist Aaron McKinley -- a connection the Auditors later discovered during their investigation.
- Captain Devil is described as "really too nice for this team."
