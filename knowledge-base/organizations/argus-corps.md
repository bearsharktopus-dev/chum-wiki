## Overview

Argus Corps is a four-member registered superhuman team established by Councilwoman Maya Richardson as a proactive security force against Philadelphia's metahuman crime wave. Publicly framed as a "rehabilitation and redemption" initiative, the team consists of superheroes whose careers were damaged by scandal or disgrace. Richardson positioned them as the aggressive, offensive complement to the Delaware Valley Defenders - going after drug labs, criminal warehouses, and crime lords rather than waiting for emergencies.

In reality, Richardson selected the members precisely because of their disgrace. Their tarnished reputations function as both leash and carrot: the threat of losing restored legitimacy keeps them compliant, while the promise of redemption keeps them motivated. The team serves as the personal enforcers of Mrs. Zenith, Richardson's secret identity within the Kingdom of Keys, giving her a legally sanctioned paramilitary force to pursue her enemies under cover of law enforcement.

Internal cohesion has deteriorated since Bulldozer (Sean McNulty) relayed evidence of Richardson's Kingdom connections. As of early 2026, three separate and mutually unaware investigations into Richardson are being conducted from within the team.

## History

### Pattinson's Pals and Patriot's Prior Career (2017-2024)

Before Argus Corps, Richard Johnson led Pattinson's Pals in South Philadelphia - a group that positioned itself as defenders of law and order but frequently engaged in racist and oppressive tactics. During Arc 7, Patriot clashed repeatedly with Sam Small, culminating in attacks at the Tacony Charter Academy homecoming dance and a one-on-one confrontation on Halloween night. Sam negotiated a truce using evidence of Egalitarian's drug use and intelligence about Project Titan, a secret military superhuman program Patriot had participated in.

After Patriot's departure for Argus Corps, leadership of the Pals passed to Bulldozer.

### Formation (April 2025)

Argus Corps was precipitated by escalating crises: a 54% increase in metahuman crimes over two years, Rogue Wave's emergence as a major threat, and Rogue Wave's hijacking of NBC10 and the emergency alert system to declare war on the Kingdom of Keys. Richardson seized on the public panic to propose a new government-backed superhero team.

Richardson personally recruited all four members at a rented coworking space (Interlude MR.4), tailoring her pitch to each recruit's vulnerabilities: Patriot's desire for order, Miasma's pragmatism about the Jump epidemic, Turbo Jett's need to rebuild her reputation, and Captain Devil's yearning for redemption after accidentally killing a civilian.

The legal framework was established through a confidential proposal (Interlude MR.5), reviewed by Katherine Huang of Tremont & Fairfax - the same firm later discovered to have Kingdom connections. It outlined detention powers, body camera mandates, civilian oversight, and NSRA reporting, projecting a 50% reduction in gang activity within the first year.

Richardson announced the team at an emergency city council session in late April 2025, framing the initiative as a war against criminal organizations.

### Early Operations (May 2025)

The team's first major operation was the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse confrontation, arriving at a Kingdom-owned facility on Trenton Avenue during a three-way encounter between the Auditors, Soot, and Kingdom enforcers Bash and Lenny. The off-the-books operation had no police backup. During the fight, Patriot pursued Sam up a metal staircase and dislocated her ankle before Jordan severed the staircase beneath him. The warehouse was destroyed by a chemical chain reaction triggered by Soot, and the Auditors escaped.

### The Safer Streets Initiative (Summer 2025)

During Arc 12, Patriot announced the Safer Streets Initiative on Fox News, offering $500 rewards for reporting "dangerous youth activities" - effectively placing bounties on underage heroes. The coded language clearly targeted powered teenagers, creating pervasive paranoia and forcing several vigilante groups to consider going underground.

### Bulldozer's Warning and Internal Fracturing (July 2025)

After Sam presented evidence of Richardson's Kingdom connections to Bulldozer at Patty's Bar, Bulldozer investigated independently and relayed his findings to Patriot. Patriot confronted Richardson at City Hall, but she laughed off the allegations. He briefed the team: Turbo Jett dismissed the claims, Captain Devil expressed quiet concern, and Miasma privately warned him about Richardson. This seeded doubt across the entire team, leading to three parallel internal investigations.

### Warrant Pursuit of Sam Small (January 2026)

After the Kingdom deployed shapeshifter Elena Morales ("Alice") to impersonate Bloodhound and commit crimes in Sam's name, Argus Corps was issued a warrant for Sam's arrest. Patriot and Turbo Jett confronted Sam on January 3rd as she walked home; she fled given their violent history. During the chase, Turbo Jett demonstrated gear-shifting up to Gear 3 and revealed a playful personality. Sam's parents confronted the agents, but Patriot insisted on custody. Miasma facilitated Sam's escape by directing her to a safehouse and filing a false pursuit report.

### The Elena Morales Operation (February 2026)

Sam and Amelia, as "Remora" and "Stingray," intercepted Alice-as-Maya during a constituent outreach event protected by Argus Corps. The operation exploited the team's protective instincts: while Patriot fought Amelia and Turbo Jett chased decoy pepper spray canisters, Captain Devil ordered Miasma to cover "Maya" - placing Alice directly in Miasma's custody. At a Fishtown safehouse, Miasma interrogated Elena, who confessed to impersonating Richardson (falsely blaming Rogue Wave rather than the Kingdom). The confession broke Richardson's alibi machine.

### Oversight Transition (April 2026)

Following political pressure - Rachel Small's parent coalition, Inquirer coverage, the Bellwether raid, and growing federal anxiety - Councilman Davis built a five-member coalition to transfer Argus Corps oversight away from Richardson. Silverstein co-sponsored the motion. Oversight formally transitioned on April 1st, stripping Richardson of her legal paramilitary capability, surveillance powers, and ability to direct operations. Richardson privately assessed the loss as "not fatal," noting she had built the Kingdom's Philadelphia operation before Argus Corps existed and had deliberately assembled the team with incompatible personalities. She subsequently resigned from City Council and announced her return as the superhero Stormrise.

## Structure

The team's legal framework grants detention powers but not arrest powers. Operations are nominally subject to civilian oversight, body cameras, and NSRA reporting, though off-the-books operations have occurred.

Headquarters staff includes Marcus (security guard), Rosario (dispatch), Jenkins (tech support), and three analysts. The Fishtown safehouse is registered under a shell company traceable through four intermediaries.

## Members

| Name | Role | Status |
|---|---|----|
| Richard Johnson / Patriot | Field Leader | Active |
| Jasmine Perez / Turbo Jett | Member; de facto PR representative | Active |
| Joshua Pleasants / Miasma | Member; secretly a mole working with Sam Small | Active |
| Andrew Mitchell / Captain Devil (Captain Jersey Devil) | Member | Active |
| Maya Richardson / Mrs. Zenith | Former Political Overseer (covert Kingdom operative); oversight removed April 2026, subsequently resigned from City Council | Inactive |

### Internal Investigations

As of the beginning of Arc 16, three separate investigations into Maya Richardson are being conducted by Argus Corps members:

- **Patriot** is investigating alone, telling no one. He believes Richardson is at minimum a reckless politician who needs removal and is considering a coup (internally characterized as a "Starscream" maneuver).
- **Turbo Jett and Captain Devil** are investigating together. They know Patriot is conducting his own research (Jett stole his phone and found browser tabs about barokinesis, Richard Duvall, and Silverstein) but are not coordinating with him. Captain Devil believes Bulldozer's claims; Jett's doubts have grown after confrontations with Sam challenged her assumptions.
- **Miasma** is a confirmed mole working with Sam since the team's formation. He knows Richardson is Mrs. Zenith and has actively undermined Kingdom operations from within, including facilitating Sam's escape and capturing Elena Morales.

## Operations

Stated focus is disrupting Jump/Fly drug networks and combating superhuman criminal organizations. Key operations:

- **Anti-vigilante enforcement**: The Safer Streets Initiative and warrants against unlicensed vigilantes, particularly Sam Small.
- **Drug operation raids**: Strikes on Rogue Wave distribution points and Kingdom targets, though Crossroads described these as keeping the team "visible, not just busy."
- **Rogue Wave marina brawl** (April 2025): Before official formation, Patriot and Turbo Jett independently intervened at a Rogue Wave event at Pennsport Marina. Patriot used a civilian as a human shield to neutralize Blink's sniper fire.
- **Town Hall security** (August 2025): Captain Devil deployed at Richardson's town hall, where he pursued Sam through City Hall before she and Maggie escaped.
- **Armored transport protection**: Assigned to protect armored transports of unknown Kingdom cargo.
- **Shrike manhunt** (late 2025/early 2026): Committed "100% of resources" to hunting the serial killer Shrike, setting up checkpoints on major roads.
- **Train rescue of Sam Small** (Spring 2026): Patriot intercepted Mr. Nothing's abduction attempt on the Broad Street Line at City Hall station, coordinated by Miasma. Patriot's peak human abilities proved immune to Nothing's power negation. Afterward, Patriot escorted Sam to Maya's office, treating her as a colleague rather than a target.

## Relationships

| Organization | Relationship |
|-------|-------|
| Kingdom of Keys | Former covert puppet organization (Richardson controlled the team as Mrs. Zenith until her oversight was removed; team members were largely unaware of the full extent) |
| NSRA (National Superhuman Response Agency) | Regulatory oversight; Argus Corps operates under NSRA Special Directive 14-B |
| Philadelphia City Government | Parent authority; Richardson originally provided political cover and funding before her departure |
| Delaware Valley Defenders (DVD) | Rival/uneasy counterpart; DVD focuses on defense while Argus Corps handles offense; Councilman Davis has repeatedly attempted to contact Richardson about Argus Corps operations |
| The Auditors | Complex; initially directed to pursue Sam Small and her allies, but the relationship has shifted as individual members have begun cooperating with Sam against the Kingdom |
| Tremont & Fairfax | Legal representation; the law firm is connected to both Argus Corps and Kingdom operations |
| Pattinson's Pals | Predecessor organization to Patriot's involvement; Bulldozer serves as an informal back-channel contact |
| Rogue Wave | Declared enemy; Argus Corps raids Rogue Wave distribution points, though these operations may serve Richardson's PR strategy |

## Trivia

- The name "Argus" references Argus Panoptes, the hundred-eyed giant of Greek mythology - ironic for a team whose overseer is hiding the biggest secrets.
- Captain Devil's costume - domino mask, big red scarf, and red beret - is deliberately styled after Kamen Rider, a tokusatsu franchise that remains obscure in the story's timeline. He is described as "really too nice for this team."
- Miasma maintains an extensive safehouse network: at least four in Philadelphia, six in Boston, two in New York, and more elsewhere.
- Turbo Jett let Sam escape after Sam rescued a civilian and a cat from a burning building, prompting the question "Are you a superhero or not, Jett?" - which continues to haunt her.
- Katherine Huang of Tremont & Fairfax, who prepared the team's legal paperwork, also defended Kingdom-connected arsonist Aaron McKinley - a connection the Auditors later discovered.
