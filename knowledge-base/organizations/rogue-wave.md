## Overview

Rogue Wave is a criminal organization dedicated to the mass distribution of Jump and Fly, two drugs that grant temporary and semi-permanent superpowers respectively. Founded and led by Lawrence Sullivan, a former corporate lawyer operating under the alias Monkey Business, the organization frames its activities not as crime but as ideological revolution -- the democratization of power that governments and genetic chance have kept locked away from ordinary people. Its members are anarcho-capitalists who view the existing superhuman status quo, in which powers are regulated by bureaucratic systems like LUMA licensing and the NSRA, as a tragedy that has squandered the transformative potential of Genesis Births.

The organization operates through a sophisticated distribution network enforced by supernaturally binding contracts. These contracts, created through Monkey Business's metahuman ability, compel signers to comply with specific terms, including maintaining operational secrecy and attacking anyone who questions Rogue Wave more than once. The system gives Rogue Wave control over a sprawling network of dealers while maintaining plausible deniability at the leadership level.

Rogue Wave occupies a distinct niche in Philadelphia's criminal ecosystem. Where the Kingdom of Keys operates as a purely profit-driven enterprise run with corporate efficiency, Rogue Wave is ideology-first -- the self-described "slobs" to the Kingdom's "snobs." The two organizations despise each other, with Rogue Wave viewing the Kingdom as sclerotic bureaucrats with no real ideological values, and the Kingdom viewing Rogue Wave as dangerous anarchists disrupting a carefully managed market. This mutual hostility has escalated into open gang warfare, with the Kingdom intercepting and chemically adulterating Rogue Wave shipments and Mr. Antithesis personally conducting operations against Rogue Wave to acquire Fly for his own purposes.

## History

Rogue Wave's existence first came to light during Arc 5 ("Mayfly"), when the captured dealer Sparkplug revealed the organization's name during interrogation. Prior to this, the effects of their products -- Jump and Fly -- had already been felt on the streets of Philadelphia, most notably through the transformation of Elias Franklin into the chimeric villain Chimera after taking Fly distributed by an unidentified dealer.

The Kingdom of Keys became aware of Rogue Wave around the same time, recognizing both the threat and opportunity posed by the power drug trade. In an MR interlude set in early August 2024, Maya Richardson reported encountering mind-controlled individuals who reacted violently to the phrase "Rogue Wave," providing the Kingdom's first direct evidence of the organization's contract-based control system.

By early 2025, Rogue Wave had grown substantially. During Arc 10 ("Plume"), Sam Small and her team infiltrated a Rogue Wave distribution event at a private marina in Pennsport on April 26, 2025. The event resembled a professional business expo more than a criminal operation, with free product samples, vendor support, and a structured recruitment pitch. It was here that Monkey Business and his enforcer Birthday Suit publicly revealed themselves, demonstrating the supernatural contract system to potential distributors. The evening ended in chaos when Patriot and Turbo Jett intervened, triggering a brawl between dealers, contracted operatives, and law enforcement.

Days later, Rogue Wave dramatically escalated by hijacking NBC10 and the emergency alert system to broadcast their manifesto. The broadcast featured all six core members and declared open war on the Kingdom of Keys. It claimed 30,000 contracted individuals in Philadelphia, a number that Jordan Westwood assessed as likely inflated. This broadcast also revealed the depth of their infiltration when Jordan deliberately provoked a Rogue Wave sleeper agent -- Officer Ridley, a school security guard at Tacony Charter Academy -- into attacking, confirming that contracted individuals were embedded in civilian institutions.

During Arc 11 ("Alarm Will Sound"), Monkey Business revised the organization's supernatural contracts after Jordan exposed a vulnerability in their wording by triggering a guard's contract clause at the school. In an interlude set in June 2025 at Rogue Wave headquarters (including a conference room called the "Nerve Center"), the core team reported that operations were exceeding projections despite setbacks: Rush Order announced a 22% increase in contract distribution and 92% retention, while Dead Drop provided intelligence showing the Kingdom's reduced operations and "erratic" enforcer deployment following the Stheno warehouse destruction. Sullivan directed controlled expansion into specific Philadelphia neighborhoods weakened by these Kingdom losses. During the same meeting, Jackpot manifested a probability assessment power that Sullivan personally tested by flipping coins. Snake Oil extracted this power into a larger-than-average crystal capable of producing sixty standard Jump doses, with Sullivan contemplating the metaphysical implications of consciousness disrupting statistical probability.

In Arc 12 ("Authorized Personnel Only"), Rogue Wave continued its expansion and public provocations. Rush Order confronted Sam Small on South Street in a deliberately staged public fight intended as propaganda for Rogue Wave's ideology. The fight ended when Sam's father, Benjamin Small, intervened with a handgun, shooting Rush Order in the shoulder. Rather than retaliating, Rush Order later released a public video declaring "Gun Dad" under Rogue Wave's protection, framing Ben's actions as embodying their philosophy of individual empowerment. The organization also hijacked another broadcast to announce a citywide "scavenger hunt" for free Jump samples, directing contracted operatives to interfere with police and Argus Corps. During this period, Rogue Wave recruited Elias Franklin (Chimera) as Snake Oil's scientific assistant following a formal interview process at a Toyota dealership back office (Interlude LS.2). Seventeen candidates survived the preceding scavenger hunt and signed preliminary contracts. Sullivan and Snake Oil evaluated candidates against explicit criteria of technical competence, ideological alignment, and psychological compatibility. Notable candidates included Aurora Reyes/Pyrausta, a self-taught chemist with fire abilities who had independently reverse-engineered Jump's chemistry and whose flame entity "Espada" revealed that Snake Oil's power crystals produce unusual effects when burned. Sullivan also rejected a proposed collaboration with Dr. Necrosis, a German bioterrorist hiding in Chicago, on ideological grounds.

The relationship between Rogue Wave and Sam Small grew more complex during Arc 13 ("Burn After Reading") and Arc 14 ("Shelter in Place"). When the escaped Daedalus inmate Shrike targeted Sam and her family, Sam negotiated a protection arrangement with Rogue Wave, leveraging Rush Order's prior declaration regarding her father. Monkey Business, Birthday Suit, and Rush Order met Sam behind the Tacony Music Hall and agreed to a one-week protection deal in exchange for an undefined future favor. Rogue Wave fulfilled this arrangement by providing surveillance photographs of Shrike's movements and skinhead followers, and later confirmed that protection extended to Shrike's associates as well.

Sam eventually repaid her debt by tipping Rogue Wave off to the Kingdom's evidence disposal operation at Roxborough Memorial Hospital. Monkey Business used this intelligence to orchestrate an operation that captured Kingdom lieutenant Mr. Polygraph (Lucas Donovan). Snake Oil then extracted Polygraph's lie-detection power in the form of a blue-green crystal at a secondary location in Camden. The operation resulted in 19 arrests -- 15 Rogue Wave members and 4 Kingdom members -- after Sam also anonymously tipped the Delaware Valley Defenders. Monkey Business had anticipated law enforcement involvement and used the contracted operatives as expendable assets, considering the arrests an acceptable cost for acquiring Polygraph's power.

This extraction of Mr. Polygraph's abilities prompted Mr. Antithesis to take personal action. As of Arc 16, the Kingdom's leader has been conducting a quiet rampage through Rogue Wave's operations, seeking to acquire sufficient Fly to restore Polygraph's powers. Mrs. Heartbeat has also been carrying out smaller hits on Rogue Wave members. The core leadership team is focused on holding the organization together under this sustained pressure.

## Structure

Rogue Wave operates as a decentralized organization with a tight core leadership group and a sprawling network of contracted distributors. Unlike the Kingdom of Keys' corporate hierarchy with formal titles (Mr./Mrs. designations), Rogue Wave's structure is flatter, with each core member fulfilling a specialized role.

The core team consists of seven members who handle leadership, enforcement, production, tactical operations, distribution, intelligence, and scientific research. Below them sits a network of dealers and operatives bound by Monkey Business's supernatural contracts. These contracted individuals are compelled to follow specific behavioral rules, including maintaining secrecy about Rogue Wave's operations and attacking anyone who questions the organization. The contracts must be understood to take effect -- they cannot include hidden terms.

The organization maintains safehouses in both Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey. It uses mundane locations for operations, such as a Toyota dealership back office for recruitment interviews, and conducts large-scale distribution events at locations like the Pennsport marina. Communication with external contacts is handled through burner phones, and the organization has demonstrated the capability to hijack broadcast television and emergency alert systems on multiple occasions.

Distribution follows a franchise model: dealers receive at least two free shipments per month and are free to sell however they see fit, paying a 25% cut of profits back to Rogue Wave. This relatively generous arrangement, combined with the supernatural enforcement mechanism, has allowed rapid network expansion across the northeastern United States.

## Operations

### Drug Production and Distribution

Rogue Wave's primary operation is the manufacture and distribution of two power-granting drugs:

**Jump** is a green capsule powder that grants temporary superpowers lasting approximately three hours. Powers from multiple doses are stackable, though incompatible combinations may produce unpredictable side effects. Side effects include disorientation and physiological stress. Street names include "Leapfrog" and "Greens." Jump is produced by grinding down the power crystals that Snake Oil extracts from metahumans and chemically adulterating them. Jackpot serves as a primary source, as his randomized powers regenerate on a precise cycle of three hours, fourteen minutes, and fifteen seconds.

**Fly** is an injectable colored liquid that grants semi-permanent powers. Unlike Jump, Fly powers weaken over time and carry significant medical complications including jaundice, anemia, blood chemistry changes (producing orange or yellow blood), and psychoactive effects lasting one to two hours. Mixing strains is dangerous. Street names include "Wings," "Go Time," and "The Ooze." Fly is derived from the same power crystals through a different refinement process.

Distribution focuses on the northeastern United States, with established networks in Philadelphia, New York City, Baltimore, and Washington D.C. The franchise model allows rapid expansion with minimal overhead: dealers sign supernatural contracts, receive regular shipments, and operate with relative autonomy in exchange for a 25% profit share and strict obedience to Rogue Wave's core rules.

### Supernatural Contract System

The backbone of Rogue Wave's operational security is Monkey Business's power to create supernaturally binding contracts. Signers are compelled to comply with all stated terms. Standard dealer contracts include provisions requiring: disclosure of full legal names, truthful income reporting, secrecy about Rogue Wave operations, automatic violent response against anyone who questions Rogue Wave more than once, and obedience to orders from designated Rogue Wave representatives. The contracts cannot include hidden terms -- the signer must understand what they are agreeing to.

A vulnerability in the contract system was exposed by Jordan Westwood, who triggered a security guard's contract clause at Tacony Charter Academy by claiming to work for the Kingdom. This prompted Monkey Business to revise the contract language during the events of Arc 11 to prevent future exploitation.

### Public Provocations

Rogue Wave has repeatedly demonstrated a capacity for large-scale public stunts, including hijacking NBC10 and the emergency alert system for their manifesto broadcast, staging a citywide Jump scavenger hunt via emergency alerts, broadcasting recruitment calls for Snake Oil's scientific assistant, and orchestrating Rush Order's public fight with Bloodhound as a propaganda spectacle.

### Power Extraction

Through Snake Oil's abilities, Rogue Wave can forcibly extract superpowers from other metahumans. The process involves Snake Oil placing his hands on the target, after which the power materializes as a crystal that grows painfully from the backs of his hands over approximately 90 seconds. This crystal can then be ingested whole (transferring the power to the consumer), or ground up and processed into Jump or Fly. The most significant use of this capability was the extraction of Mr. Polygraph's lie-detection power, which Monkey Business has since acquired for personal use.

## Relationships

| Organization | Relationship |
|--------------|-------------|
| Kingdom of Keys | Hostile rival; open gang warfare. Rogue Wave views the Kingdom as ideologically bankrupt profiteers. The Kingdom views Rogue Wave as dangerous anarchists. Mr. Antithesis is personally targeting Rogue Wave operations as of Arc 16. |
| The Auditors (Sam Small) | Complicated; enemies turned reluctant allies. Sam infiltrated their distribution event, fought Rush Order, but later negotiated a protection deal and provided intelligence that helped them capture Mr. Polygraph. Rush Order has developed a strange adversarial respect for Sam. |
| Argus Corps | Hostile; government-sanctioned heroes targeting Rogue Wave distribution points under Maya Richardson's direction. |
| Delaware Valley Defenders | Hostile; law enforcement heroes who investigate and disrupt Rogue Wave operations. |
| Philly Phreaks | Affiliated; Chimera transitioned from the Phreaks to Rogue Wave as Snake Oil's scientific assistant. |
| NSRA | Hostile; federal agency investigating Jump and Fly distribution. |

## Trivia

- Rogue Wave's distribution events are run with the polish and professionalism of legitimate business expos, complete with free samples, vendor support, and structured recruitment pitches.
- Rush Order was shot by Sam's father Benjamin Small during their South Street confrontation. Rather than resenting this, Rush Order declared Ben under Rogue Wave's protection and framed the incident as validating their ideology of individual empowerment.
- The organization conducted recruitment interviews for Snake Oil's assistant at a Toyota dealership back office, chosen specifically for its mundane appearance.
- Monkey Business respects Sam Small for consistently sticking to her principles, even when those principles put her in direct opposition to Rogue Wave.
- Birthday Suit and Monkey Business are in a romantic relationship that everyone in the organization knows about and nobody cares about.
- The Kingdom's Mrs. Xenograft created the drug Hypeman by reverse-engineering Rogue Wave's Jump and Fly formulas, and later developed Vysera using advancements from that research combined with samples of Mr. Nothing's flesh.
- When Elena Morales (the shapeshifter "Alice") was captured and interrogated by Miasma, she falsely blamed Rogue Wave for hiring her to impersonate Maya Richardson, rather than revealing the Kingdom's involvement.
- Chimera is currently investigating Vysera, the power-suppressing drug, and suspects it is derived from Snake Oil's research -- which it is.
- Rogue Wave's headquarters includes a conference room called the "Nerve Center," used for strategic planning meetings and operational briefings (LS.1).
- During the LS.2 interview process, Aurora Reyes/Pyrausta revealed to Snake Oil that his power crystals produce unusual effects on fire when burned -- a property that had not been previously documented by Rogue Wave's own scientists.
- Sullivan's rejection of Dr. Necrosis was purely ideological: Necrosis opposes profit-based medical approaches, which fundamentally conflicts with Rogue Wave's anarcho-capitalist philosophy, despite the tactical advantages that viral Jump vectors could have provided.
- The LS.2 recruitment process reveals the organization's intellectual ambitions: candidates were assessed not just for skills but for philosophical alignment, and Sullivan personally participated in every interview rather than delegating the task.
