## Overview

Rogue Wave is a criminal organization dedicated to mass distribution of Jump and Fly, drugs granting temporary and semi-permanent superpowers respectively. Led by Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business), a former contract lawyer, the organization frames its activities as ideological revolution - democratizing power that governments and genetic chance have kept locked away. Its anarcho-capitalist members view the existing superhuman status quo, where powers are regulated by LUMA licensing and the NSRA, as a tragedy squandering the potential of Genesis Births.

Operations are enforced through Monkey Business's metahuman ability to create supernaturally binding contracts, compelling signers to maintain secrecy and attack anyone who questions Rogue Wave more than once. This gives Rogue Wave control over a sprawling dealer network while maintaining plausible deniability at the leadership level.

Rogue Wave occupies a distinct niche opposite the Kingdom of Keys: the self-described "slobs" to the Kingdom's "snobs." Where the Kingdom is purely profit-driven with corporate efficiency, Rogue Wave is ideology-first. Mutual hostility has escalated into open gang warfare.

## History

Rogue Wave first came to light during Arc 5 when dealer Sparkplug revealed the name under interrogation. The Kingdom became aware of them around the same time; in early August 2024, Maya Richardson reported encountering mind-controlled individuals who reacted violently to the phrase "Rogue Wave," providing the Kingdom's first evidence of the contract-based control system.

By early 2025, the organization had grown substantially. During Arc 10, Sam Small's team infiltrated a Rogue Wave distribution event at a private Pennsport marina (April 26, 2025) - run with the polish of a professional business expo, with free samples, vendor support, and structured recruitment. Monkey Business and Birthday Suit publicly demonstrated the supernatural contract system. The evening ended in chaos when Patriot and Turbo Jett intervened.

Days later, Rogue Wave hijacked NBC10 and the emergency alert system to broadcast their manifesto, featuring all six core members and declaring open war on the Kingdom. They claimed 30,000 contracted individuals in Philadelphia and 60,000 on the east coast (numbers Jordan Westwood assessed as likely inflated). Jordan exposed a vulnerability in the contract system by deliberately provoking Officer Ridley, a contracted sleeper agent at Tacony Charter Academy, and posting the recorded violent response online.

During Arc 11, Sullivan revised contract language to prevent future exploitation, shifting from immediate violent response to a multi-stage system. In a June 2025 headquarters meeting, Rush Order reported a 22% increase in contract distribution and 92% retention, while Dead Drop noted the Kingdom's reduced and "erratic" operations following the Stheno destruction. Sullivan directed controlled expansion into neighborhoods weakened by Kingdom losses. During the same meeting, Jackpot manifested a probability assessment power that Sullivan personally tested; Snake Oil extracted it into a crystal capable of producing sixty standard Jump doses.

In Arc 12, Rush Order confronted Sam on South Street in a staged propaganda fight. Sam's father Benjamin Small intervened with a handgun, shooting Rush Order. Rather than retaliating, Rush Order released a video declaring "Gun Dad" under Rogue Wave's protection, framing Ben's actions as embodying their philosophy. The organization also hijacked another broadcast for a citywide Jump scavenger hunt. During this period, Rogue Wave recruited Elias Franklin (Chimera) as Snake Oil's assistant through a formal interview process at a Toyota dealership back office (Interlude LS.2). Seventeen candidates survived the scavenger hunt; Sullivan and Snake Oil evaluated them for technical competence, ideological alignment, and psychological compatibility. Notable candidates included Aurora Reyes/Pyrausta, a self-taught chemist with fire abilities who had independently reverse-engineered Jump's chemistry and whose flame entity "Espada" revealed that Snake Oil's crystals produce unusual effects when burned. Sullivan rejected a proposed collaboration with Dr. Necrosis, a German bioterrorist in Chicago, on ideological grounds - Necrosis opposes profit-based approaches, fundamentally conflicting with Rogue Wave's anarcho-capitalism.

During Arcs 13-14, Sam negotiated a protection arrangement after escaped Daedalus inmate Shrike targeted her family. She leveraged Rush Order's prior declaration about her father. Sullivan, Birthday Suit, and Rush Order met Sam behind the Music Hall and agreed to a one-week deal in exchange for an undefined future favor. Sullivan deliberately avoided his binding contract power because Sam's mother Rachel caught him on juvenile contract voidability. Rogue Wave provided surveillance photos of Shrike's movements and a three-layer protection system (observation, alert, intervention). During the arrangement, Rush Order privately revealed to Sam that Maya Richardson had not been in Harrisburg during state hearings - someone had impersonated her - using his passive locating ability.

After Sam's hospitalization following the Shrike fight, Rogue Wave delivered a note reading "Mr. Polygraph. We'll be in touch." Sam eventually repaid her debt by texting Rush Order the location of a Kingdom evidence disposal at Roxborough Memorial Hospital. Monkey Business orchestrated a multi-day stakeout using a geased PI as bait. When Mr. Polygraph and Mr. Nothing arrived, the Rogue Wave combat team moved in. Snake Oil extracted Polygraph's lie-detection power as a blue-green crystal at a secondary Camden location. The operation resulted in 19 arrests (15 Rogue Wave, 4 Kingdom) after Sam also tipped the DVD. Monkey Business had anticipated law enforcement involvement and used contracted operatives as expendable assets.

Meanwhile, the Kingdom intercepted Rogue Wave shipments, adulterating Jump compounds to cause cardiac reactions and seizures - gang warfare to undercut Rogue Wave's market share and credibility.

As of Arc 16, Mr. Antithesis has been conducting a personal rampage through Rogue Wave operations seeking Fly to restore Polygraph's powers. Mrs. Heartbeat has also been hitting Rogue Wave members. Separately, Rush Order and Dead Drop tracked Maya Richardson to a rooftop during a manufactured blizzard and confronted her directly, though she escaped (Interlude DC.3).

## Structure

Rogue Wave operates as a decentralized organization with a tight core leadership group and a sprawling contracted distributor network. Unlike the Kingdom's corporate hierarchy, Rogue Wave's structure is flatter, with each core member in a specialized role.

Below the seven core members sits a network of dealers bound by supernatural contracts compelling specific behavioral rules including secrecy and violent response to questioning. Contracts must be understood to take effect - no hidden terms.

Distribution follows a franchise model: dealers receive at least two free shipments per month, sell as they see fit, and pay a 25% cut of profits. This arrangement, combined with supernatural enforcement, has enabled rapid expansion across the northeastern United States.

The organization uses mundane locations for operations and communicates via burner phones.

## Operations

### Drug Production and Distribution

Rogue Wave manufactures two power-granting drugs:

**Jump** - Green capsule powder granting temporary superpowers (~3 hours). Powers from multiple doses stack, though incompatible combinations produce unpredictable side effects. Side effects include disorientation and physiological stress. Street names: "Leapfrog," "Greens." Produced by grinding Snake Oil's power crystals and chemically adulterating them. Jackpot serves as a primary source; his randomized powers regenerate on a cycle of 3 hours, 14 minutes, 15 seconds.

**Fly** - Injectable colored liquid granting semi-permanent powers. Unlike Jump, Fly powers weaken over time and carry significant complications: jaundice, anemia, blood chemistry changes (orange or yellow blood), and psychoactive effects lasting 1-2 hours. Mixing strains is dangerous. Street names: "Wings," "Go Time," "The Ooze." Derived from the same crystals through a different refinement process.

### Supernatural Contract System

The backbone of Rogue Wave's operational security. Standard dealer contracts require: disclosure of full legal names, truthful income reporting, operational secrecy, automatic violent response against anyone questioning Rogue Wave more than once, and obedience to designated representatives. Jordan Westwood's exposure of the system's vulnerability prompted contract revision in Arc 11, shifting to a multi-stage response (false information followed by non-violent disengagement).

### Power Extraction

Snake Oil can forcibly extract superpowers from metahumans. He places his hands on the target, and the power materializes as a crystal growing painfully from the backs of his hands over ~90 seconds. The crystal can be ingested whole (transferring the power) or processed into Jump/Fly. The most significant extraction was Mr. Polygraph's lie-detection power, which Monkey Business has since acquired personally.

## Relationships

| Organization | Relationship |
|--------------|-------------|
| Kingdom of Keys | Hostile rival; open gang warfare. Mr. Antithesis personally targeting Rogue Wave operations as of Arc 16. |
| The Auditors (Sam Small) | Complicated; enemies turned reluctant allies. Sam infiltrated their event and fought Rush Order, but later negotiated protection and provided intelligence for the Polygraph capture. |
| Argus Corps | Hostile; government heroes targeting distribution points. |
| Delaware Valley Defenders | Hostile; investigating and disrupting Rogue Wave operations. |
| Philly Phreaks | Affiliated; Chimera transitioned from the Phreaks to Rogue Wave. |
| NSRA | Hostile; federal agency investigating Jump and Fly distribution. |

## Trivia

- Monkey Business respects Sam Small for consistently sticking to her principles, even in direct opposition to Rogue Wave.
- Birthday Suit and Monkey Business are in a romantic relationship that everyone in the organization knows about.
- Mrs. Xenograft of the Kingdom created Hypeman by reverse-engineering Rogue Wave's Jump and Fly formulas, and later developed Vysera using that research combined with Mr. Nothing's flesh.
- When Elena Morales (shapeshifter "Alice") was captured and interrogated by Miasma, she falsely blamed Rogue Wave for hiring her to impersonate Maya Richardson rather than revealing the Kingdom's involvement.
- Chimera is investigating Vysera, the power-suppressing drug, and suspects it derives from Snake Oil's research - which it does.
- Sullivan activated his powers during a hostage situation at his law firm, Whitmore & Associates. His geas power manifested when he realized the hostage-takers' verbal promise constituted a binding agreement he could exploit. He quit law six months later and founded Rogue Wave from people wronged by broken contracts and failed promises (Interlude LS.3).
- Rush Order's passive "pigeon sense" allows him to determine the direction and approximate distance of anyone whose full legal name he knows.
