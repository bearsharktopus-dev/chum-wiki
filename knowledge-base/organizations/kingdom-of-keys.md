## Overview

The Kingdom of Keys is the primary criminal organization in the northeastern United States in Chum. It operates as a ruthlessly pragmatic enterprise with no ideology or politics - only the pursuit of capital and control. Its leader, Mr. Antithesis, requires all senior operatives to be metahumans, leveraging superhuman abilities as tools and barriers to prosecution. Each of the twenty-six principal members holds a codename from A through Z, prefixed by "Mr." or "Mrs."

Operations span drug manufacturing, money laundering, contract killings, corporate espionage, and large-scale theft. Legal fronts including Tremont & Fairfax insulate leadership from scrutiny. The Philadelphia branch - formerly under Mrs. Zenith (Maya Richardson), now commanded by Mr. Nothing following the April 2026 restructuring - serves as the faction most directly opposed to protagonist Sam Small.

## History

### Origins and Founding (2018)

Trent Fairfax, a Philadelphia-born Columbia Law School graduate with severe OCD and a latent metahuman ability, conceived the Kingdom following the Big Raid - a coordinated 2018 law enforcement operation that destroyed or crippled the traditional crime families of the Northeast, leaving a massive underworld power vacuum.

On his twenty-sixth birthday, Fairfax made a symbolic pact to build an organization of exactly twenty-six superpowered operatives, one per letter of the alphabet. He formally founded the Kingdom in October 2018.

### Consolidation and Expansion (2019-2023)

The Kingdom's first major heist took place in Philadelphia in December 2020. Mrs. Zenith was recruited in March 2019 after weather-power regulations forced her retirement from heroism as Stormrise. Mrs. Xenograft was recruited in December 2021 after Mrs. Zenith and the now-deceased Mr. Bomb approached her at her laboratory, coercing her with the promise of unlimited research funding free from ethical constraints.

By June 2023, the Kingdom had established five operational branches across the Northeast with fully codified protocols.

### Conflict with Sam Small and the Auditors (2023-2026)

The Kingdom first drew Philadelphia's superhero community's attention in mid-2023, when Sam Small encountered Mr. Nothing, Mr. Polygraph, and Mr. Mudslide during her early investigations as Bloodhound. Sam later infiltrated the Crescent nightclub, a Kingdom money-laundering front, gathering intelligence on the hierarchy. Mrs. Zenith was first observed during Mr. Tyrannosaur's attack on Sam's house, using weather powers to generate rain as tactical cover, and was later spotted at Liberty Belle's funeral among honored guests.

Devonte Harris (Playback) independently investigated Kingdom dock activities, uncovering "Operation Ivory" at the Philadelphia Zoo. The zoo operation used rhino theft as misdirection while obtaining materials for Mrs. Xenograft's drug research. Afterward, Mrs. Xenograft presented Mr. Antithesis with Hypeman, a power-enhancing drug derived from Rogue Wave's Jump and Fly compounds.

Maya Richardson's election to Philadelphia City Council in late 2024 gave the Kingdom unprecedented political leverage. A high-level leadership meeting at Nobu Fifty Seven in Manhattan (MR.2), attended by Mrs. Zenith, Mrs. Blue Velvet, Mr. ESP, Mr. Keys, and Mr. Yellowjacket (Antithesis joining virtually), covered Maya's new political position, the Rogue Wave situation, Atlantic City and Newark operations, expansion of legitimate fronts, and a deliberate strategy to psychologically pressure young superheroes into burning out. Ophelia (Blue Velvet) mentioned "Project Hollywood" - an Afghanistan-based operation raising child soldiers, the same project that created Deathgirl. Maya introduced anti-vigilante legislation targeting young superheroes.

In 2025, the Auditors uncovered connections between Tremont & Fairfax, Aaron McKinley's defense, and Stheno Pharmaceuticals. The vigilante Soot destroyed the Stheno warehouse ($3.2 million facility; multiple explosion points and chlorine gas release, MR.6). In response, Mrs. Zenith coordinated from her City Council office. Enforcers Lenny and Bash were arrested but remained silent. The Boston branch dispatched Mr. Retribution and Mrs. Quiet to Philadelphia under Mr. ESP's orders, with Mrs. Zenith assuming operational command. She authorized "whatever means necessary" to identify the perpetrators, including interrogation of minors, and set a two-week timeline (MR.6). Following Soot's killing (MR.7), Mrs. Zenith assigned Mr. Polygraph and Mr. Nothing to coordinate Hypeman production rebuilding with Mrs. Xenograft at a new Camden facility, and ordered the Boston operatives to remain to monitor Bloodhound.

Sam's first direct encounter with Mr. Antithesis occurred in June 2025, when Mr. Retribution and Mrs. Quiet brought her to the Manhattan headquarters. She provided Antithesis with carefully mixed truth and deception about Soot's identity, successfully obtaining two Hypeman autoinjectors while protecting her ally Kate Smith.

### The Rogue Wave War and Red Calf (2025-2026)

Rogue Wave, an anarcho-capitalist drug network led by Monkey Business (Lawrence Sullivan), publicly declared war on the Kingdom via a hijacked emergency broadcast. The Kingdom responded by intercepting Rogue Wave shipments, modifying compounds, and releasing tainted product to distributors.

The international mercenary group Red Calf, led by Porcelain ("the strongest superhuman on Earth"), was revealed to hold authority over the Kingdom. Porcelain first approached Mrs. Zenith in a quiet meeting (MR.4), commending her successes and requesting assistance extracting a target from Daedalus, while also purchasing Hypeman by requesting the procurement number directly from Maya. Later (MR.8, late August 2025), Porcelain met Mr. Antithesis at the Manhattan headquarters, leaving him in rare emotional distress - his office destroyed, knuckles raw, breathing rapid. Porcelain demanded the extraction of Deathgirl (Daisy Zhen) from Daedalus Correctional Facility (North Wing, Level 3, Cell Block D, isolation ward), threatening to expose Mrs. Zenith's Kingdom connections. The mission was scheduled for September 10th to coincide with state senate hearings on anti-vigilante legislation, capitalizing on Rachel Small's parent coalition protests distracting law enforcement. Mrs. Zenith's weather powers were designated as crucial for storm cover, and Porcelain specifically requested Mrs. Doppelganger.

The Daedalus planning meeting at Bella Notte (BM.3) revealed critical details: $2 million per surviving operator, Antithesis joining via video call (unusually casual for him), and Mr. Tyrannosaur designated as the "contingency response." Mrs. Xenograft identified a missing corridor in Porcelain's blueprints; when pressed about collateral escapes, Antithesis revealed Porcelain was "not concerned about collateral escapes." The extraction (EW.1) used a four-person tunneling team (Mudslide, Vector, Tarbaby, Mrs. Synapse) beneath Daedalus while a B-Team created diversions. They breached Deathgirl's cell (D-7) and sedated her, but she woke prematurely, copied multiple operatives' powers, and escaped into lower tunnels. Red Calf operative Tarbaby revealed a pre-planted tracking device - a contingency withheld from Kingdom operatives, confirming Red Calf's goal was removing Deathgirl from government custody rather than capturing her directly.

In late 2025, Rogue Wave used intelligence from Sam to engineer a confrontation at Roxborough Memorial Hospital resulting in Mr. Polygraph's arrest along with four Kingdom operatives and fifteen Rogue Wave foot soldiers - the latter sacrificed as expendable to deprive the Kingdom of its chief interrogator. Mr. Antithesis began personally pursuing Rogue Wave to acquire Fly for re-powering Mr. Polygraph.

The Kingdom expanded its protection racket in Philadelphia, marking businesses with white pawn stickers.

As of April 2026, Sam's multi-vector pressure campaign - FBI evidence of tainted Jump crossing state lines, media investigations via the Philadelphia Inquirer, Rachel Small's parent coalition, and Argus Corps members independently investigating Mrs. Zenith - forced Maya Richardson to resign from City Council on April 3rd. She publicly framed it as a return to her Stormrise identity, announcing plans to seek superhero re-certification and launch a national advocacy campaign for geometeorological control reform. Multiple Argus Corps members (Patriot, Turbo Jett, Captain Devil, Miasma) had been independently investigating her Kingdom connections without coordinating with each other. Mrs. Doppelganger released a public confession video timed to frame Rogue Wave and present Maya as a victim.

### Restructuring (April 2026)

Maya's departure triggered a major organizational restructuring. Mr. Antithesis severed the Kingdom's political arm from the Philadelphia branch entirely, declaring Philadelphia "a revenue center, not a political project." Key changes:

- **Mr. Keys** promoted to third-in-command in Maya's absence, serving as primary advisor directly under Mr. Antithesis
- **Mr. Nothing** assumed operational command of Philadelphia, having functionally run the branch for three weeks already
- **Mr. Preclude** - formerly Mr. Polygraph, re-powered through Fly with a new ability called "Preclusion" (rule-making) - became Mr. Nothing's second in Philadelphia, handling enforcement, compliance, and personnel discipline
- **Mrs. Zygote** (Dr. Euphemia "Effie" Dunham), a stem cell and embryonic development researcher introduced to Mr. Antithesis by Porcelain, joined under Mrs. Xenograft for biological research - filling the vacant Z designation on a provisional basis
- Maya's council seat was filled by an interim appointee; her shell companies were either dissolved or continued operating; her campaign accounts were designed to survive audit

The Bellwether site in West Philadelphia was also lost during this period - sixteen people detained, equipment seized, and the distribution chain severed, costing approximately $400,000 in delayed Hypeman production and disrupting Jump supply. The ATF discovered improvised explosives on-site that belonged to Marathon, a Rogue Wave contractor who had been using the basement as a personal armory.

Mr. Antithesis maintained that removing Maya eliminated the convergence of pressure from the reporter, the coalition, and the Argus Corps investigations - all of which had been targeting Maya personally rather than the Kingdom's operational infrastructure. The youth vigilantism ordinance and its $500 bounty remained active and unrepealed.

Prior to the restructuring, Mr. Nothing intercepted Sam on the Broad Street Line subway alongside Mrs. Quiet and multiple operatives - including one who could manipulate train coupling joints and another positioned with the conductor. Nothing attempted to walk Sam off the train at City Hall, but Patriot intervened, identifying Nothing by name and face from the Philadelphia Zoo raid records. Patriot forced Nothing to release Sam, threatening to break his wrists and noting that Captain Devil, Turbo Jett, and Miasma were being rerouted to the station. Nothing chose to withdraw.

## Structure

The Kingdom is organized as a strict hierarchy with clear chains of command.

### Leadership Tier

At the apex is **Mr. Antithesis (Mr. A)**, operating from Manhattan headquarters, known to most subordinates only as "Upper Management." His powers make direct confrontation by metahumans extremely dangerous; special precautions keep powered individuals outside his range during meetings.

### Second Tier (Branch Commanders and Advisors)

Directly below are **Mrs. Blue Velvet (Mrs. B)**, his consigliere and right-hand in Manhattan, and **Mr. Keys (Mr. K)**, promoted to third-in-command and primary advisor following Mrs. Zenith's departure in April 2026. Prior to her departure, **Mrs. Zenith (Mrs. Z)** commanded the Philadelphia branch.

### Third Tier (Senior Branch Leaders)

**Mr. ESP (Mr. E)** (Boston), **Mr. Nothing (Mr. N)** (Philadelphia, from April 2026), and **Mr. Yellowjacket (Mr. Y)** (Baltimore) serve as acting bosses of their respective branches.

### The Main 26

The remaining members form the operational core, each holding an alphabetical codename and commanding varying numbers of non-powered soldiers, lieutenants, and associates.

### Support Personnel

Beneath the main 26 are conventional criminal operatives: soldiers, enforcers, lieutenants, lawyers, accountants, and other support staff. The organization maintains connections to legitimate businesses, most notably Tremont & Fairfax and the now-destroyed Stheno Pharmaceuticals.

## Operations

### Drug Manufacturing and Distribution

The Kingdom's primary criminal enterprise, managed by Mrs. Xenograft through the front company Stheno Pharmaceuticals. Major products:

- **Hypeman** - A power-enhancing drug superior to Rogue Wave's Fly with fewer side effects, created by adapting Rogue Wave's Jump and Fly compounds. Distributed in autoinjector format. The Stheno warehouse on Trenton Avenue served as primary production until its destruction by Soot in mid-2025; production relocated to Camden. The Bellwether site in West Philadelphia was subsequently lost in early 2026 - raided by the ATF, costing approximately $400,000 in delayed Hypeman production and severing the distribution chain.
The Kingdom also engages in chemical warfare against Rogue Wave, intercepting Jump shipments, modifying compounds, and releasing tainted product as both gang warfare and human testing. Mrs. Zygote, a stem cell researcher, joined the biological research division under Mrs. Xenograft in April 2026.

### Political Corruption (Dissolved)

Mrs. Zenith's dual role as Philadelphia City Councilwoman and Kingdom branch commander represented the organization's most sophisticated operation until its dissolution in April 2026. Through her political position, she:

- Introduced anti-vigilante legislation targeting young superheroes; by mid-2025 (MR.7), expanding to state level in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and New York, with plans for federal legislation via Representative Martin
- Established Argus Corps as an RSO under NSRA Special Directive 14-B (MR.5), with detention (not arrest) powers, mandatory body cameras, civilian oversight, and regular NSRA reporting. The confidential proposal, reviewed by Katherine Huang, cited a 54% increase in metahuman crimes and projected a 50% reduction in gang activity
- Eliminated political opponents, including Richard Duvall, who attempted to blackmail her
- Maintained alibis using Mrs. Doppelganger's shapeshifting to place her in Philadelphia during Kingdom business elsewhere
- Used weather manipulation to generate targeted storms as cover for criminal operations (e.g., the 16-inch blizzard enabling 15 simultaneous break-ins in Northeast Philadelphia)

Following Maya's departure, Mr. Antithesis severed the political arm entirely. The youth vigilantism ordinance and $500 bounty remain active but the Kingdom no longer pursues legislative influence. Maya is performing cooperation with federal investigators, feeding them expendable assets and pre-written-off infrastructure while protecting structural information. Mr. Antithesis views her compliance as driven by rational self-interest rather than loyalty.

### Legal Infrastructure

Tremont & Fairfax - Mr. Antithesis's grand-uncle's firm - serves as the Kingdom's primary legal shield. Attorneys like Katherine Huang represent Kingdom-connected clients without necessarily knowing the full extent. Catherine Giuliano operates as Mrs. Zenith's personal fixer with full knowledge. Mr. Antithesis also operates Alcott & Associates, an investment firm fronting for money laundering. The Kingdom has used numerous shell companies (Orion Holdings, Cerulean Dynamics, Lockhart & Greene, Harbinger Holdings, Eclipse Enterprises, PharmaSyn, NextGen Biologics, Helix Innovations), many professionally dissolved when they attracted attention.

### Safehouses and Meeting Locations

- **Safehouse condo, Philadelphia** - Used by Mrs. Zenith following a pursuit in August 2024 (MR.1); debriefed with Mr. Nothing and Mudslide
- **Spruce Street safehouse, West Philadelphia** - Mid-June 2025 debrief on Soot's assassination; attended by Zenith, Nothing, Retribution, Quiet, and Polygraph (MR.7)
- **Midtown Manhattan safehouse** - Planning session location for the Daedalus prison break (MR.8)
- **Nobu Fifty Seven, Manhattan** - Private room for high-level leadership meetings (MR.2)
- **Kingdom HQ, South Philadelphia** - Disguised as an accounting firm; professional reception area with fish tank, break room with chandelier (BM.1)
- **Lancaster steakhouse, Lancaster, PA** - Kingdom-owned restaurant; money laundering front and safehouse; used during prison transport ambush retreat (BM.2)
- **Bella Notte restaurant, Staten Island** - Private room for Daedalus planning meeting; confirmation phrases and signal jammers (BM.3)
- **Kingdom-owned bar** - Trinh-Norwood's recruitment meeting, December 2021 (LTN.1)

### Money Laundering

The Crescent nightclub in Center City, Philadelphia, serves as a money-laundering front, with its VIP second floor used for operative meetings. The Lancaster steakhouse and the South Philadelphia HQ (disguised as an accounting firm) also serve laundering functions.

### Contract Killing and Enforcement

Mrs. Quiet and Mrs. Heartbeat serve as primary silent killers, while Mr. Tyrannosaur and Mr. Mudslide handle intimidation and physical enforcement in Philadelphia. The Boston branch has deployed operatives (Mr. Retribution, Mrs. Quiet) for special operations outside their home territory.

### Intelligence and Counterintelligence

Mr. Camcorder's sensory data recording enables surveillance and blackmail. Mrs. Doppelganger's shapeshifting provides infiltration against secure facilities. Mr. Nothing formerly served alongside Mr. Polygraph as the Philadelphia branch's interrogation team, combining power nullification with lie detection. Following Polygraph's arrest and reconstitution as Mr. Preclude, the interrogation dynamic has shifted - Preclude's new Preclusion ability (rule-making) serves enforcement and compliance rather than interrogation.

## Relationships

| Organization | Relationship |
|--------------|-------------|
| Red Calf | Parent/superior organization; compels cooperation through blackmail of Mrs. Zenith's Kingdom connections. Porcelain also purchases Hypeman commercially. |
| Rogue Wave | Rival; open war over drug trade territory |
| Tremont & Fairfax | Legal front; provides defense and corporate infrastructure |
| Stheno Pharmaceuticals | Former front company; drug manufacturing facility, destroyed 2025 |
| Argus Corps | Tool/puppet; government hero team established by Mrs. Zenith |
| The Auditors | Primary adversary; Sam Small's investigative team |
| Delaware Valley Defenders | Adversary; Philadelphia's registered superhero team |
| Philly Phreaks | Former associate; Deathgirl was "gifted" to the Phreaks by the Kingdom |
| Philadelphia City Council | Formerly infiltrated; Mrs. Zenith held a seat until resignation in April 2026; political arm now fully severed |

## Trivia

- The alphabetical naming convention was deduced by Jordan Westwood (Safeguard), who noticed no two operatives share the same first letter - "The Kingdom of Keys. Like on a keyboard."
- Mrs. Xenograft's armored greyhound Scylla (spliced with lobster) and her glow-in-the-dark axolotl Darwin are among the most distinctive assets of any Kingdom member.
- Mr. Mudslide was Sam Small's first arrest as a vigilante; he began as a petty criminal attempting to rob a Walgreens before being rescued and recruited by Mr. Bomb.
- Mr. Bomb is confirmed deceased; his death preceded Mrs. Blue Velvet's recruitment as his replacement in the "B" designation.
- Mrs. Zenith and Mr. Nothing were romantically involved in the past and continue to have occasional flings. They have a daughter, Roxanne Elisabeth "Roxy" Hayes, age six, who lives with Mr. Nothing's relatives in the Bronx.
- Mr. Yellowjacket described Upper Management as "Quiet. Intense. Lots of hand sanitizer" - the hand sanitizer detail connects to Mr. Antithesis's severe OCD (BM.2).
- Mrs. Jellyjam's codename is derived from the Goosebumps book series (BM.2).
- The Kingdom's disguised transport vehicles include a plumbing van branded "Ace Flow Solutions" (BM.2).
- Kingdom operatives watching superhero news in the BM.1 break room reacted with visible resentment, suggesting rank-and-file harbor personal grievances against heroes.
- The Daedalus extraction team wore unusual combat gear instead of the Kingdom's standard suits, signaling deviation from normal protocol (EW.1).
- Leadership meetings mix formality and personal warmth - in MR.2, members exchanged personal updates before business, suggesting genuine collegial relationships.
- The Kingdom maintains a formal Code of Conduct that Mrs. Heartbeat can recite by heart: no recruitment or operations involving minors, mandatory discretion.
- Kingdom recruitment involves initiation murders serving dual purpose: proving willingness to kill and creating blackmail material for loyalty.
- Mr. Antithesis developed his operational philosophy from taxonomizing comic book villain failures, later applying the same framework to cataloguing Tony Soprano's strategic errors in The Sopranos.
- Trent Fairfax recruited Aaron McKinley (the Coyote) in prison as "Mr. Prometheus," offering Kingdom membership, a dose of Fly, and a fiefdom over Camden in exchange for killing Sam Small.
- The Kingdom's standard-issue suits are cut-resistant.
- Councilman David Silverstein (Republican, Third District) was fast-tracking liquor licenses for Kingdom front businesses in exchange for campaign donations from Kingdom shell companies.
- The Kingdom maintains a security detail in Chicago watching Wei and Xiuying Zhen (Daisy Zhen's parents) at all times - a precautionary measure to stay on Deathgirl's good side.
- Mr. Antithesis's philosophy on leverage distinguishes between rational actors and parents, whom he considers irrational in ways game theory cannot model. He explicitly rejected Porcelain's suggestion to use Roxanne as leverage against Maya, arguing it would create "a suicide bomber, not a cooperative asset."
- Mrs. Zenith's actual power is barokinesis (atmospheric pressure manipulation), not weather control as registered with the NSRA. While she conceals her true abilities from the NSRA and the public, the Kingdom is fully aware and uses her barokinesis for assassinations.
