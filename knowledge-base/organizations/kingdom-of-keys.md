## Overview

The Kingdom of Keys is the primary criminal organization operating across the northeastern United States in the world of Chum. It functions not as an ideological movement but as a ruthlessly pragmatic criminal enterprise driven by profit and control. Its leader, Mr. Antithesis, has articulated this philosophy in blunt terms: the organization has no ideology, no politics -- only the pursuit of capital and the control it provides.

The Kingdom rose to prominence in the power vacuum created by the Big Raid of 2018, which dismantled most of the traditional crime families that had previously dominated the Northeast's underworld. Where older organizations operated along ethnic and familial lines, the Kingdom innovated by requiring all senior operatives to be metahumans, leveraging superhuman abilities as both tools of the trade and barriers to prosecution. Each of its twenty-six principal members is assigned a codename following an alphabetical convention from A through Z, prefixed by "Mr." or "Mrs."

The organization's operations span drug manufacturing and distribution, money laundering, political corruption, contract killings, corporate espionage, and large-scale theft. Through legal fronts such as the Tremont & Fairfax law firm and Stheno Pharmaceuticals, the Kingdom maintains a veneer of legitimacy that insulates its leadership from law enforcement scrutiny. It is the principal antagonist organization for much of the series, with its Philadelphia branch under Mrs. Zenith (Maya Richardson) serving as the faction most directly opposed to the protagonist, Sam Small.

## History

### Origins and Founding (2018)

Trent Fairfax, a Philadelphia-born business school graduate with severe OCD and a latent metahuman ability, conceived the Kingdom of Keys following the Big Raid. The Big Raid -- a coordinated law enforcement operation in 2018 that destroyed or severely weakened the traditional organized crime families of the northeastern United States -- left a massive power vacuum in the region's underworld. Fairfax recognized the opportunity and moved to fill it.

On the birthday that marked his twenty-sixth year, Fairfax made a symbolic pact to build an organization of exactly twenty-six superpowered operatives, one for each letter of the alphabet. He formally founded the Kingdom of Keys in October 2018 and began methodically recruiting metahuman criminals, offering them resources, structure, and protection in exchange for loyalty and operational discipline.

### Consolidation and Expansion (2019-2023)

The Kingdom's first major heist took place in Philadelphia in December 2020, announcing the organization's arrival as a serious force. Over the following years, Fairfax consolidated power through a combination of strategic recruitment, elimination of rivals, and the establishment of legitimate business fronts.

Mrs. Zenith (Maya Richardson), a former superhero known as "Stormrise" who had been forced into retirement by weather-power regulations under the Stewart administration, was recruited in March 2019 and placed in charge of the Philadelphia and Camden operations. Mrs. Xenograft (Dr. Lena Trinh-Norwood) was recruited in December 2021 after Mrs. Zenith and the now-deceased Mr. Bomb approached her at her laboratory, coercing and enticing her with the promise of unlimited research funding free from ethical constraints.

By June 2023, the Kingdom had established five operational branches across the Northeast, with Fairfax firmly in control from his Manhattan headquarters. The organizational structure, operational protocols, and chain of command were fully codified.

### Conflict with Sam Small and the Auditors (2023-2026)

The Kingdom first came to the attention of Philadelphia's superhero community in mid-2023, when Sam Small, operating as the vigilante Bloodhound, encountered Kingdom operatives Mr. Nothing, Mr. Polygraph, and Mr. Mudslide during her early investigations. The Delaware Valley Defenders identified the organization as a criminal group filling the void left in the drug trade by the destruction of the old crime families.

Over the following months, Sam and her allies conducted an escalating investigation. Sam infiltrated the Crescent nightclub, a Kingdom money-laundering front in Center City, Philadelphia, and gathered intelligence on the organization's hierarchy. Mrs. Zenith was first observed at Liberty Belle's funeral, establishing an early connection between the Kingdom and Philadelphia's political establishment.

The conflict intensified through multiple arcs. Devonte Harris (Playback) independently investigated Kingdom activities at the docks, uncovering "Operation Ivory" -- a plan involving the Philadelphia Zoo. The zoo operation, which used the theft of rhinos as misdirection for broader objectives, ended with the Kingdom obtaining materials for Mrs. Xenograft's drug research. Following the zoo incident, Mrs. Xenograft presented Mr. Antithesis with her new creation: Hypeman, a power-enhancing drug derived from Rogue Wave's Jump and Fly compounds.

Maya Richardson's election to the Philadelphia City Council in late 2024 gave the Kingdom unprecedented political leverage. A high-level Kingdom leadership meeting at a private room in Nobu Fifty Seven in Manhattan (MR.2), attended by Mrs. Zenith, Mrs. Blue Velvet, Mr. ESP, Mr. Keys, and Mr. Yellowjacket, with Mr. Antithesis joining virtually, served as a strategic planning session. Maya reported on her new political position, and the leadership discussed the Rogue Wave situation, operations in Atlantic City and Newark, expansion of legitimate business fronts, and formulated a deliberate strategy to psychologically pressure young superheroes into burning out. Ophelia (Blue Velvet) also mentioned "Project Hollywood," an operation run by an unspecified group currently in Afghanistan that raises child soldiers, the same project that created Deathgirl. Maya introduced anti-vigilante legislation targeting young superheroes, directly threatening Sam's operations while advancing the Kingdom's interests through legitimate channels.

In 2025, the Auditors -- Sam's investigative team -- uncovered the connection between Tremont & Fairfax law firm, Aaron McKinley's defense, and a front company called Stheno Pharmaceuticals. The destruction of the Stheno warehouse by the vigilante Soot dealt a significant blow to the Kingdom's drug production capabilities -- the facility was valued at $3.2 million, with evidence suggesting deliberate sabotage via multiple explosion points and chlorine gas release (MR.6). In the aftermath, Mrs. Zenith reviewed official reports from her City Council office and coordinated the response. Kingdom enforcers Lenny and Bash were arrested but remained silent. The Boston branch dispatched Mr. Retribution and Mrs. Quiet to Philadelphia, with Mr. ESP specifically ordering them to handle "cleaning" operations. Mrs. Zenith authorized "whatever means necessary" to identify the perpetrators, including interrogation of minors, and set a two-week investigation timeline (MR.6). Following the confirmation of Soot's killing (MR.7), Mrs. Zenith assigned Mr. Polygraph and Mr. Nothing to coordinate with Mrs. Xenograft on rebuilding Hypeman production at a new facility in Camden, and ordered the Boston operatives to remain in Philadelphia to monitor Bloodhound.

Sam's first direct encounter with Mr. Antithesis occurred in June 2025, when she was brought to the Kingdom's Manhattan headquarters by Mr. Retribution and Mrs. Quiet. During this meeting, she provided Antithesis with carefully crafted information mixing truth and deception about Soot's identity as part of a larger strategic plan. She successfully obtained two Hypeman autoinjectors while protecting her ally Kate Smith.

### The Rogue Wave War and Red Calf (2025-2026)

The emergence of Rogue Wave, an anarcho-capitalist drug distribution network led by Monkey Business (Lawrence Sullivan), created a second front for the Kingdom. Rogue Wave publicly declared war on the Kingdom via a hijacked emergency broadcast, revealing their extensive network and directly challenging the Kingdom's control of the drug trade. The Kingdom responded by intercepting Rogue Wave shipments, modifying chemical compounds, and releasing tainted product to street-level distributors.

A critical revelation came when the international mercenary group Red Calf, led by Porcelain (described as "the strongest superhuman on Earth"), was shown to hold authority over the Kingdom. Porcelain first approached Mrs. Zenith in a quiet office meeting (MR.4), commending her successes and requesting assistance in extracting a target from Daedalus, while also purchasing Hypeman for Red Calf by requesting the procurement number directly from Maya. Later (MR.8, late August 2025), Porcelain met with Mr. Antithesis at the Manhattan headquarters, leaving Antithesis in rare emotional distress -- his office was found destroyed, with raw knuckles and rapid breathing. Porcelain demanded the extraction of Deathgirl (Daisy Zhen) from Daedalus Correctional Facility (North Wing, Level 3, Cell Block D, isolation ward), threatening to expose Mrs. Zenith's Kingdom connections if they refused. The mission was specifically scheduled for September 10th to coincide with state senate hearings on anti-vigilante legislation, capitalizing on Rachel Small's parent coalition protests distracting law enforcement. Mrs. Zenith's weather powers were designated as crucial for storm cover, and Porcelain specifically requested Mrs. Doppelganger for the prison break team. Antithesis implied Porcelain may have been planning a larger prison break beyond just extracting Deathgirl. The Daedalus planning meeting at Bella Notte (BM.3) revealed critical operational details: payment was set at $2 million per surviving operator, Mr. Antithesis joined via video call (highly unusual, as he had never before shown his face so casually), and Mr. Tyrannosaur was designated as the "contingency response" -- the nuclear option. Mrs. Xenograft identified a missing corridor in the blueprints provided by Porcelain, and when pressed about collateral escapes, Mr. Antithesis revealed Porcelain was "not concerned about collateral escapes." The extraction itself (EW.1) involved a four-person tunneling team (Mudslide, Vector, Tarbaby, Mrs. Synapse) infiltrating beneath Daedalus while a separate B-Team created diversions at the main facility. The team tunneled to Cell Block D, breached Deathgirl's cell (D-7), and sedated her, but Deathgirl woke prematurely and copied multiple operatives' powers before escaping into lower tunnels. Red Calf operative Tarbaby revealed a pre-planted tracking device on Deathgirl, a contingency deliberately withheld from Kingdom operatives, confirming Red Calf's primary goal was removing Deathgirl from government custody rather than capturing her directly. This operation revealed that Mr. Antithesis himself was not the top of the power structure -- the Kingdom operated as a subordinate to Red Calf's broader international criminal enterprise.

As of early 2026, the Kingdom remains active on multiple fronts. Mr. Antithesis is personally pursuing Rogue Wave to acquire Fly for re-powering Mr. Polygraph. Mrs. Zenith continues her proxy war against Sam Small through political and criminal channels, while multiple members of Argus Corps -- the government-sanctioned hero team she ostensibly controls -- have begun independently investigating her Kingdom connections.

## Structure

The Kingdom of Keys is organized as a strict hierarchy with clear chains of command.

### Leadership Tier

At the apex is **Mr. Antithesis (Mr. A)**, who operates from the Manhattan headquarters and is known to most subordinates only as "Upper Management." His counter-power generation ability makes direct confrontation by metahumans extremely dangerous, and special precautions are taken to keep powered individuals outside his range during meetings.

### Second Tier (Branch Commanders)

Directly below Mr. Antithesis are **Mrs. Blue Velvet (Mrs. B)** and **Mrs. Zenith (Mrs. Z)**, who serve as his primary lieutenants. Mrs. Blue Velvet functions as his consigliere and right-hand in Manhattan, while Mrs. Zenith commands the critically important Philadelphia branch.

### Third Tier (Senior Branch Leaders)

The next level consists of **Mr. ESP (Mr. E)**, **Mr. Keys (Mr. K)**, and **Mr. Yellowjacket (Mr. Y)**, who serve as acting bosses of the Boston, Washington D.C., and Baltimore branches respectively.

### The Main 26

Below the senior leadership, the remaining members of the "main 26" form the operational core. Each holds a codename corresponding to a letter of the alphabet and commands varying numbers of non-powered soldiers, lieutenants, and associates.

### Support Personnel

Beneath the main 26 are conventional criminal operatives: soldiers, street-level enforcers, lieutenants, lawyers, accountants, and other support staff who may or may not possess metahuman abilities. The organization also maintains connections to legitimate businesses and legal professionals, most notably the Tremont & Fairfax law firm and the now-destroyed Stheno Pharmaceuticals.

## Operations

### Drug Manufacturing and Distribution

The Kingdom's most significant criminal enterprise is its drug operation, primarily managed by Mrs. Xenograft through the front company Stheno Pharmaceuticals. The organization produces two major drugs:

- **Hypeman** -- A power-enhancing drug superior to Rogue Wave's Fly, with fewer side effects. Created by Mrs. Xenograft by adapting research from Rogue Wave's Jump and Fly compounds. Distributed in autoinjector format. The Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse on Trenton Avenue served as its primary production facility until its destruction by the vigilante Soot in mid-2025.
- **Vysera (daxerimab)** -- A superpower suppressant drug developed through an advancement of the Hypeman research combined with samples of Mr. Nothing's flesh. Currently in NSRA experimental trials. The Kingdom's involvement in its creation is not publicly known.

The Kingdom has also engaged in chemical warfare against Rogue Wave, intercepting their Jump shipments, modifying the chemical compounds, and releasing tainted product back to street-level distributors as both gang warfare tactics and human testing.

### Political Corruption

Mrs. Zenith's dual role as Philadelphia City Councilwoman and Kingdom branch commander represents the organization's most sophisticated operation. Through her political position, she has:

- Introduced anti-vigilante legislation targeting young superheroes, directly hamstringing the heroes most likely to investigate the Kingdom. By mid-2025 (MR.7), the legislation was expanding to state level in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and New York, with plans for federal legislation via Representative Martin.
- Established Argus Corps, a government-sanctioned superhero team operating as a Registered Superhuman Entity Organization (RSO) under NSRA Special Directive 14-B (MR.5). The team has detention but not arrest powers, mandatory body cameras for all engagements, a civilian oversight board, and regular NSRA reporting. The confidential proposal, reviewed by Katherine Huang of Tremont & Fairfax, cited a 54% increase in metahuman crimes over two years and projected a 50% reduction in gang activity within the first year.
- Eliminated political opponents, including Richard Duvall, who attempted to blackmail her over her Kingdom connections
- Maintained an elaborate alibi system using Mrs. Doppelganger's shapeshifting to place her in Philadelphia while she conducts Kingdom business elsewhere
- Used her weather manipulation powers to generate targeted storms providing cover for coordinated criminal operations (such as the 16-inch blizzard in Northeast Philadelphia that enabled 15 simultaneous commercial break-ins)

### Legal Infrastructure

The Tremont & Fairfax law firm serves as the Kingdom's primary legal shield. The firm handles defense for Kingdom-connected individuals, with attorneys like Katherine Huang representing clients such as Aaron McKinley without necessarily knowing the full extent of the Kingdom's involvement. Catherine Giuliano operates as Mrs. Zenith's personal legal fixer with full knowledge of the organization's activities.

### Safehouses and Meeting Locations

The Kingdom maintains a network of safehouses and meeting locations across the Northeast. Known locations include:

- **Safehouse condo in Philadelphia** -- Used by Mrs. Zenith following a pursuit by unknown hostiles in August 2024 (MR.1), where she debriefed with Mr. Nothing and Mudslide.
- **Spruce Street safehouse, West Philadelphia** -- Used for a mid-June 2025 debrief on Soot's assassination and strategic planning, attended by Mrs. Zenith, Mr. Nothing, Mr. Retribution, Mrs. Quiet, and Mr. Polygraph (MR.7).
- **Midtown Manhattan safehouse** -- Planning session location for the Daedalus prison break operation; Mrs. Zenith was instructed to attend at 9:00 AM the day after receiving orders from Mr. Antithesis (MR.8).
- **Nobu Fifty Seven, Manhattan** -- Private room used for a high-level Kingdom leadership meeting (MR.2).
- **Kingdom headquarters, South Philadelphia** -- Disguised as an accounting firm, with a professional reception area featuring a vigilant receptionist, a large fish tank in the lobby, and a break room with luxurious amenities including a chandelier (BM.1).
- **Lancaster steakhouse, Lancaster, PA** -- Kingdom-owned restaurant that doubles as a money laundering front and safehouse. Used by operatives retreating from the prison transport ambush (BM.2).
- **Bella Notte restaurant, Staten Island** -- Private room used for the Daedalus prison break planning meeting, with security measures including confirmation phrases and signal jammers (BM.3).
- **Kingdom-owned bar** -- Dimly lit bar used for Trinh-Norwood's recruitment meeting in December 2021 (LTN.1).

### Money Laundering

The Crescent nightclub in Center City, Philadelphia, has been identified as a Kingdom money-laundering front. The establishment's VIP second floor serves as a meeting location for Kingdom operatives. A steakhouse in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, also serves as a money laundering operation, with its restaurant front providing cover for the financial operations (BM.2). The Kingdom's Philadelphia headquarters is disguised as an accounting firm (BM.1).

### Contract Killing and Enforcement

The Kingdom maintains a network of skilled assassins and enforcers across its branches. Mrs. Quiet and Mrs. Heartbeat serve as the primary silent killers, while Mr. Tyrannosaur and Mr. Mudslide handle intimidation and physical enforcement in Philadelphia. The Boston branch has deployed Mr. Retribution and Mrs. Quiet for special operations outside their home territory, including confronting Sam Small in Philadelphia.

### Intelligence and Counterintelligence

Mr. Camcorder's ability to record sensory data as digital files makes him invaluable for surveillance and blackmail operations. Mrs. Doppelganger's shapeshifting provides infiltration capabilities against secure facilities and organizations. Mr. Polygraph and Mr. Nothing serve as the Philadelphia branch's primary interrogation team, combining lie detection with power nullification to break down even metahuman subjects.

## Relationships

| Organization | Relationship |

| Tremont & Fairfax | Legal front; law megafirm provides legal defense and corporate infrastructure |
| Stheno Pharmaceuticals | Former front company; Kingdom drug manufacturing facility, destroyed in 2025 |
| Argus Corps | Tool/puppet; government hero team established by Mrs. Zenith, staffed with compromised heroes |
| The Auditors | Primary adversary; Sam Small's investigative team, responsible for uncovering Kingdom operations |

## Trivia

- The alphabetical naming convention (Mr./Mrs. A through Z) was conceived by Mr. Antithesis on his twenty-sixth birthday, creating a symbolic link between the number of letters in the English alphabet and the number of his core operatives.
- Despite being listed as "Mr. ESP," Wesley Chen's codename uses the designation "Mrs. E" in some documentation, suggesting a possible clerical convention or deliberate misdirection.
- Mr. Antithesis's counter-power generation ability is so potent that it is described as "story-breaking" -- special precautions are taken to keep powered individuals outside his range during meetings, including his own subordinates.
- Mrs. Xenograft's armored greyhound Scylla (spliced with lobster) and her glow-in-the-dark axolotl Darwin are among the most distinctive assets associated with any Kingdom member.
- Mr. Mudslide was Sam Small's first arrest as a vigilante, beginning as a petty criminal attempting to rob a Walgreens before being rescued and recruited by Mr. Bomb.
- The former member known as Mr. Bomb is confirmed deceased; his death preceded Mrs. Blue Velvet's recruitment into the organization as his replacement in the "B" designation.
- Multiple members of Argus Corps -- including Patriot, Turbo Jett, Captain Devil, and Miasma -- are independently investigating Mrs. Zenith's Kingdom connections as of early 2026, though none are coordinating their investigations with each other.
- Porcelain of Red Calf has purchased Hypeman from the Kingdom, establishing a commercial as well as hierarchical relationship between the two organizations.
- The Kingdom's Philadelphia branch warehouse was located at 4547 Trenton Avenue in Northeast Philadelphia.
- Mrs. Zenith and Mr. Nothing were romantically involved in the past and continue to have occasional flings.
- Mr. Yellowjacket, the Baltimore branch boss, described Upper Management as "Quiet. Intense. Lots of hand sanitizer" -- the hand sanitizer detail likely connects to Mr. Antithesis's severe OCD (BM.2).
- Mrs. Jellyjam's codename is derived from the Goosebumps book series, a detail she revealed during the Lancaster safehouse retreat (BM.2).
- The Kingdom's disguised transport vehicles include a plumbing van branded "Ace Flow Solutions," used to transport operatives after the prison transport ambush (BM.2).
- During the BM.1 interlude, Kingdom operatives watching superhero news on television in their break room reacted with visible resentment, suggesting the organization's rank-and-file harbor personal grievances against the hero community.
- The Daedalus extraction team wore unusual combat gear instead of the Kingdom's standard suits, signaling the operation's deviation from normal protocol (EW.1).
- The Kingdom's leadership meetings include a mix of formality and personal warmth -- in MR.2, members exchanged personal updates before formal business began, suggesting genuine collegial relationships despite the criminal context.
- Mr. Antithesis joins branch commander meetings virtually rather than in person, maintaining distance from his powered subordinates to avoid triggering his counter-power generation.
- The Kingdom's response to the Stheno warehouse destruction demonstrated significant cross-branch coordination: the Boston branch dispatched operatives (Mr. Retribution and Mrs. Quiet) to Philadelphia under Mr. ESP's orders, with Mrs. Zenith assuming operational command over the borrowed personnel (MR.6).
- Ophelia (Mrs. Blue Velvet) referenced "Project Hollywood" at a leadership meeting (MR.2) -- an operation run by an unspecified group currently in Afghanistan that raises child soldiers, the same project that created Deathgirl. The nature of the Kingdom's relationship to this project remains unclear.
- After Porcelain's meeting with Mr. Antithesis (MR.8), the normally composed crime lord was found with his office completely destroyed, showing raw knuckles, rapid breathing, and twitching eyes -- one of the only documented instances of Mr. Antithesis losing composure, illustrating the power dynamic between the Kingdom and Red Calf.
- Following the Stheno warehouse destruction, Hypeman production was relocated to a new facility in Camden, New Jersey, with Mr. Polygraph and Mr. Nothing assigned to coordinate the rebuilding effort with Mrs. Xenograft (MR.7).
