## Overview

The ISC is the foremost multilateral organization governing superhuman activity worldwide. Operating autonomously under the UN umbrella, it serves as the central forum for member states to negotiate superhuman policy, share intelligence, and coordinate cross-border crisis response. Its remit spans research, a classified global superhuman register, international legislative recommendations, and deployment of elite metahuman operatives through its Crisis Response Unit.

As of 2023, the ISC counts 73 member nations. Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia have declined membership; Israel and Switzerland maintain observer status. Supporters view it as indispensable for managing threats that transcend borders. Critics regard it as a vehicle for Western geopolitical interests and an infringement on national sovereignty.

## History

The ISC originated in the early 2000s after high-profile natural disasters - including earthquakes in Japan and Hurricane Katrina - highlighted both the potential and the dangers of uncoordinated superhuman intervention. Superhumans had intervened to rescue civilians and alter the course of natural events, raising unresolved questions about jurisdiction, accountability, and cross-border ethics.

The initial proposal emerged from a closed-door meeting among the U.S., U.K., France, Japan, and Canada, which provided founding financial and technological support. A three-year deliberation period followed, engaging stakeholders from government, civil society, legal academia, and the superhuman community to draft the ISC's mandate and ethical frameworks. The ISC was inaugurated in Geneva in 2005.

Since founding, the rise of superhuman-shaped nations (Kurdistan, Balochistan, the Federation of Saharan States) has brought new members seeking international legitimacy. The emergence of superhuman terrorism and organized crime following the Big Raid of 2019 has pressured the ISC to expand beyond its original mandate.

## Structure

The Executive Council consists of one government-appointed representative per member state, convening on a regular schedule with the ability to hold emergency digital sessions on one hour's notice. It is chaired by a Secretary-General serving a single five-year term who, unlike the UN counterpart, holds executive authority to mobilize rapid-response teams and enact temporary emergency policies subject to retroactive council approval.

Standard matters follow one-country-one-vote. Special resolutions (military action, sanctions) require a two-thirds supermajority. A fast-track mechanism permits simple-majority passage if uncontested within a designated timeframe. Member states may commandeer ISC resources for domestic natural disaster prevention without a full council vote.

### Divisions

- **Superhuman Register** - Classified global database of government-employed superhumans with power classifications, psychological profiles, and risk assessments
- **Research and Development** - Investigates the nature, scope, and origins of superhuman abilities; subject to independent ethical oversight
- **Crisis Response Unit (CRU)** - Elite multinational superhuman squad for cross-border crises (see Operations)
- **Legislation and Policy** - International legislative recommendations and ethical guidelines for superhuman conduct
- **Public Outreach** - Education campaigns, community forums, and first responder training

## Operations

### Notable CRU Operations

| Year | Operation | Summary |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 2010 | Balochistan Crisis | Deployed as a buffer force during Balochistan's declaration of independence from Pakistan and Iran. Praised for preventing loss of life; criticized for overstepping sovereign rights. |
| 2012 | Typhoon Wukong | Weakened a Category 5 supertyphoon threatening Southeast Asia to Category 4, preventing an estimated two hundred deaths. Raised debate over ecological side effects of weather modification. |
| 2014 | Fall of the UAE | Secured critical infrastructure during widespread riots following corruption revelations. Deemed a "controlled success" but stretched CRU resources thin. The UAE voluntarily disbanded into its component Emirates two years later. |
| 2016 | Saharan Agricultural Initiative | Non-combat humanitarian deployment supporting superhuman efforts to transform Saharan desert into arable land. Raised ethical concerns about large-scale environmental modification. |
| 2017 | Ukrainian Standoff | Multi-dimensional operation involving intelligence, combat, and diplomatic negotiation in response to Russian intervention and local superhuman activity. Achieved fragile peace but has since been cited by Russia as evidence of Western bias. |
| 2018 | Amazonian Autonomy | Assisted in establishing the Amazonian Autonomous Zone in collaboration with indigenous superhumans. Widely regarded as a model of respectful cooperation with local sovereignty. |
| 2020 | Syrian Détente | Pre-emptive operation to disarm chemical weapons controlled by rogue superhumans. Successful but legally controversial due to sovereignty and international law concerns. |
| 2020-2021 | COVID-19 Response | Logistical and medical units contributed to pandemic supply distribution and direct medical procedures. |
| 2022 | North Korean Crisis | Invited by North Korea to stabilize an internal power struggle involving rogue superhumans. Details remain classified and subject to widespread speculation. |
| 2023 | Australian Wildfires | Deployed weather modification and firefighting superpowers to control devastating Australian wildfires. |

The ISC also maintains oversight of international superhuman medical practices and contributes to regulatory and ethical frameworks governing metahuman healthcare.

## Relationships

| Organization | Relationship |
|--------------|-------------|
| United Nations | Parent body (affiliated); ISC operates autonomously under UN umbrella |
| NSRA (National Superhuman Response Agency) | Cooperative; the NSRA is the primary U.S. domestic counterpart for superhuman regulation |
| GESSOC (Global Enforcement and Suppression of Superhuman Organized Crime) | Allied; international task force addressing superhuman organized crime, created 2018 |
| NATO | Allied; most NATO members are ISC members |
| SGEC (Superhuman Geometeorological Engineering Commission) | Cooperative; federal regulatory body under the NSRA relevant to ISC environmental modification operations |
| Federation of Saharan States | Member state; emerged partly through ISC-supported operations |

## Trivia

- The Superhuman Register has been targeted by multiple high-profile cyberattacks from hacktivist groups and hostile governments, though none have succeeded to date.
- Russia has used footage from the 2017 Ukrainian Standoff in nationalistic propaganda campaigns, citing it as evidence that the CRU operates primarily for Western interests.
- North Korea's 2022 invitation to the CRU remains one of the most secretive operations in the organization's history, with virtually no details released publicly.
