## Overview

The International Superhuman Coalition is the foremost multilateral organization dedicated to the governance, coordination, and regulation of superhuman activity worldwide. Operating under the umbrella of the United Nations while maintaining its own autonomous governance structure, the ISC serves as the central forum through which member states negotiate superhuman policy, share intelligence on metahuman populations, and coordinate responses to cross-border crises involving superhumans.

The ISC's remit is broad, spanning research into the nature and origins of superhuman abilities, the maintenance of a classified global register of government-employed superhumans, the formulation of international legislative recommendations, and the deployment of elite metahuman operatives through its Crisis Response Unit. As of 2023, the organization counts 73 member nations across every inhabited continent, though several notable states -- including Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia -- have declined membership, while Israel and Switzerland maintain observer status.

The Coalition occupies a contentious position in global politics. Its supporters view it as an indispensable mechanism for preventing unilateral superhuman action and managing threats that transcend national borders. Its critics, particularly among states skeptical of Western influence, regard it as a vehicle for the geopolitical interests of its founding nations and a potential infringement on national sovereignty.

## History

The ISC's origins trace to the early 2000s, when a series of high-profile natural disasters -- including catastrophic earthquakes in Japan and the devastation of Hurricane Katrina -- drew attention to both the potential and the dangers of uncoordinated superhuman intervention. During these crises, individual superhumans had intervened to rescue civilians and even alter the course of natural events, but their actions raised unresolved questions about jurisdiction, accountability, and the ethics of operating across sovereign borders.

The initial proposal for an international superhuman oversight body emerged from a closed-door meeting among representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, and Canada. These five nations provided the founding financial and technological support. A three-year deliberation period followed, during which a temporary international committee engaged stakeholders from government, civil society, legal academia, and the superhuman community itself to draft the ISC's mandate, operational guidelines, and ethical frameworks. These negotiations involved extensive round-table discussions and public forums conducted through the United Nations. The ISC was officially inaugurated in a ceremony held in Geneva in 2005.

Since its founding, the ISC has navigated an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. The rise of newly independent states such as Kurdistan, Balochistan, and the United Saharan States -- nations whose very existence was shaped by the actions of local superhumans -- has brought new members who view ISC participation as a path to international legitimacy, even as they guard their sovereignty over their own metahuman populations. Meanwhile, the emergence of superhuman terrorism and superhuman-led organized crime following the Big Raid of 2019 has placed pressure on the ISC to expand its capabilities and jurisdiction beyond its original mandate.

## Structure

The ISC's governance is built around an Executive Council composed of one government-appointed representative from each member state. These representatives typically possess specialized expertise in superhuman affairs or crisis management. The Council convenes on a regular schedule and retains the ability to hold emergency digital sessions on as little as one hour's notice to address rapidly developing superhuman crises.

The Executive Council is chaired by a Secretary-General who serves a single, non-renewable five-year term. Unlike the largely diplomatic role of the UN Secretary-General, the ISC's Secretary-General holds executive authority to mobilize rapid-response teams and enact temporary policies during emergencies, subject to retroactive council approval.

Voting follows a one-country-one-vote principle for standard matters. A weighted voting system applies to high-impact decisions, with special resolutions -- particularly those involving military action or sanctions against member states -- requiring a two-thirds supermajority. A fast-track mechanism permits resolutions to pass by simple majority if uncontested within a designated time frame, reflecting the need for rapid decision-making in superhuman emergencies. Additionally, member states may commandeer ISC resources for natural disaster prevention exclusively on their own domestic soil.

The ISC's operational capacity is organized into several key divisions:

- **Superhuman Register** -- A classified global database of government-employed superhumans, containing power classifications, psychological profiles, and risk assessments. Access is restricted to high-ranking officials and security experts from member states.
- **Research and Development** -- Conducts research into the nature, scope, limitations, and origins of superhuman abilities through advanced laboratories and multidisciplinary teams. Subject to independent ethical oversight committees.
- **Crisis Response Unit (CRU)** -- An elite multinational squad of superhumans deployed for cross-border crises. (See Operations below.)
- **Legislation and Policy** -- Formulates international legislative recommendations and ethical guidelines for superhuman conduct, drawing on data, case studies, and collaboration with legal experts and human rights organizations.
- **Public Outreach** -- Conducts education campaigns, community forums, and training programs for law enforcement and first responders to address public misunderstanding and fear surrounding superhumans.

## Operations

The ISC's most visible operational arm is the Crisis Response Unit (CRU), an elite multinational squad of superhumans deployed to crises that transcend national boundaries, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and regional destabilization events. The CRU remains the organization's most controversial element, with critics charging that its deployments infringe on national sovereignty and that it disproportionately serves Western interests.

### Notable CRU Operations

| Year | Operation | Summary |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 2010 | Balochistan Crisis | Deployed as a buffer force during Balochistan's declaration of independence from Pakistan and Iran. Praised for preventing loss of life; criticized for overstepping sovereign rights. |
| 2012 | Typhoon Wukong | Weakened a Category 5 supertyphoon threatening Southeast Asia to Category 4, preventing an estimated two hundred deaths. Raised debate over ecological side effects of weather modification. |
| 2014 | Fall of the UAE | Secured critical infrastructure during widespread riots following corruption revelations. Deemed a "controlled success" but stretched CRU resources thin. The UAE voluntarily disbanded into its component Emirates two years later. |
| 2016 | Saharan Agricultural Initiative | Non-combat humanitarian deployment supporting superhuman efforts to transform Saharan desert into arable land. Raised ethical concerns about large-scale environmental modification. |
| 2017 | Ukrainian Standoff | Multi-dimensional operation involving intelligence, combat, and diplomatic negotiation in response to Russian intervention and local superhuman activity. Achieved fragile peace but has since been cited by Russia as evidence of Western bias. |
| 2018 | Amazonian Autonomy | Assisted in establishing the Amazonian Autonomous Zone in collaboration with indigenous superhumans. Widely regarded as a model of respectful cooperation with local sovereignty. |
| 2020 | Syrian Detente | Pre-emptive operation to disarm chemical weapons controlled by rogue superhumans. Successful but legally controversial due to sovereignty and international law concerns. |
| 2020-2021 | COVID-19 Response | Logistical and medical units contributed to pandemic supply distribution and direct medical procedures. |
| 2022 | North Korean Crisis | Invited by North Korea to stabilize an internal power struggle involving rogue superhumans. Details remain classified and subject to widespread speculation. |
| 2023 | Australian Wildfires | Deployed weather modification and firefighting superpowers to control devastating Australian wildfires. |

Beyond the CRU, the ISC conducts ongoing operations through its Superhuman Register (intelligence sharing among member states), Research and Development division (investigating the origins and mechanics of superhuman abilities), and Legislation and Policy division (standardizing international superhuman law). The ISC also maintains oversight of international superhuman medical practices and contributes to the regulatory and ethical frameworks governing metahuman healthcare.
