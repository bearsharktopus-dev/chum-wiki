## Overview

Metahuman psychotherapy is a specialized branch of clinical psychology devoted to individuals who possess superhuman abilities. The majority of the metahuman population consists of civilians integrating extraordinary powers into ordinary lives, and conventional therapeutic frameworks require significant adaptation for their cognitive, emotional, and neurological realities.

The discipline encompasses identity counseling for the newly activated, trauma processing from high-stakes power usage, family therapy for superhuman-civilian dynamics, and management of power-specific conditions like chronic overstimulation and memory overload. Practitioners must also navigate secret identity confidentiality, mandatory reporting when powers pose public threats, and physical safety risks from unpredictable power manifestation during sessions.

Professional development is supported by the Superhuman Psychological Association (SPA), the Superhuman Mental Health Online Learning Consortium (SMHOLC), and the Hartman Institute for Superhuman Mental Health.

## Mechanics

### Adapted Therapeutic Modalities

Traditional approaches form the foundation but require adaptation. CBT is extended to target power-specific beliefs impeding ability management. Mindfulness interventions incorporate awareness of physiological and sensory dimensions of power manifestation. EMDR addresses Activation Event distress and combat-related PTSD. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has shown particular utility for clients with persistent unwanted sensory input such as precognition or enhanced perception.

### Power-Specific Interventions

Beyond adapted conventional methods, the field employs collaborative ability-control training with power specialists, structured frameworks for healthy power-usage boundaries, and techniques addressing the interplay between emotional regulation and ability manifestation. Experiential modalities like horticultural therapy have been used where a client's powers relate to specific environmental domains.

### Group and Peer Support

Group therapy and peer support are particularly valuable given the pervasive isolation many metahumans experience. Shared-experience settings provide validation that individual therapy cannot replicate, though practitioners must manage power differentials between members, ability-based hierarchies, and interpersonal conflicts carrying heightened physical risk.

### Therapeutic Alliance Considerations

Establishing trust with superhuman clients is complicated by societal stigma, legal ramifications of power disclosure, and secret identity protection. Practitioners must establish clear confidentiality parameters early, explicitly addressing how superhuman-specific disclosures will be handled.

## History

The field developed as the superhuman civilian population grew into the hundreds of thousands and conventional mental health practice proved insufficient. Early practitioners recognized that Activation Events themselves constituted significant trauma independent of subsequent power-related difficulties.

Dr. Alexis Hartman (UC Berkeley, postdoctoral fellowship at the National Superhuman Research Center) became the leading figure in formalizing the discipline. She founded the Hartman Institute and co-authored *The Psychology of the Superhuman Experience: A Comprehensive Guide for Clinicians*. Her three-part series *The Superhuman Psyche* became a widely referenced introductory text.

The field continues to evolve through multidisciplinary collaboration between mental health professionals, neurologists, physicians, legal experts, and community organizations.

## Implications

Over two-thirds of the approximately 500,000 U.S. metahumans live as civilians, so demand for competent mental health services extends far beyond those in costume. The field supports the NSRA/LUMA regulatory infrastructure by helping metahumans develop the self-control necessary for licensed activity.

Mandatory reporting obligations create ongoing ethical tension when a client's abilities or intentions pose credible public threats. Superhuman family therapy has emerged as a distinct subspecialty addressing feelings of inadequacy, jealousy, or fear among non-powered family members.

Practitioner well-being is also a concern: elevated vicarious trauma risk and, in rare cases, physical danger from involuntary power manifestation make robust supervision and safety planning essential.

## Classification / Taxonomy

### Common Psychological Issues

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Impostor Syndrome | Feelings of being undeserving of powers or doubting one's ability to control them; particularly common in late-activated individuals |
| Guilt and Responsibility Complexes | Heightened compulsion to use abilities to prevent harm, with intense self-blame when unable to do so |
| Isolation and Loneliness | Perceived inability of non-powered individuals to understand superhuman experiences; compounded by secrecy requirements |
| High-Stakes Trauma / PTSD | Flashbacks, nightmares, and hypervigilance resulting from combat situations, rescue operations, or witnessed tragedies |
| Substance Abuse | Maladaptive coping with stress, trauma, or isolation; potentially elevated risk due to unique stressors of superhuman life |

### Power-Specific Neurological and Psychological Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Power-Induced Synesthesia | Overlap or blending of sensory experiences caused by sensory or perceptual abilities (e.g., perceiving sounds as colors) |
| Chronic Overstimulation | Persistent sensory or cognitive overwhelm in individuals with heightened senses or enhanced information processing |
| Memory Overload | Mental fatigue and decision-making difficulties in individuals with enhanced memory or knowledge absorption abilities |
| Power-Related OCD | Obsessive-compulsive behaviors associated with abilities requiring precision or control, such as telekinesis |
| Identity Dissociation | Fragmentation of self-concept in individuals whose abilities significantly alter their physical appearance or sense of identity |
| Neuroplasticity-Driven Personality Shifts | Changes in cognitive functioning, emotional regulation, or personality traits resulting from prolonged power usage and associated brain adaptation |
| Superhuman Existential Anxiety | Profound existential questioning about the purpose, meaning, and moral weight of possessing extraordinary abilities |

### Ethical Framework Areas

| Area | Core Concern |
|------|-------------|
| Confidentiality and Secret Identity Protection | Balancing therapeutic disclosure norms against the legal and personal consequences of identity exposure |
| Dual Relationships and Safety | Managing the risk that a client's abilities pose to the therapist or blur professional boundaries |
| Mandatory Reporting | Navigating duty-to-warn obligations when a superhuman client discloses intentions posing public safety threats |
| Power Misuse Accountability | Addressing illegal or harmful power usage while maintaining the therapeutic alliance |

## Trivia

- Dr. Hartman's guide identifies four case study practitioners: Dr. Emily Nakamura, Dr. Michael Okonkwo, Dr. Hiroshi Tanaka (Tokyo-based), and Dr. Gabriela Hernandez, each specializing in different aspects of superhuman therapy.
- Horticultural therapy was used in at least one documented case involving a client with plant manipulation powers, illustrating the field's emphasis on tailoring interventions to specific ability types.
