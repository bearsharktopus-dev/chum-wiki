## Overview

Superhuman anatomy refers to the physiological changes observed in metahumans whose powers impose significant physical demands. Metahumans with abilities such as super strength undergo radical internal restructuring across nearly every organ system - skeletal, muscular, cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine - to sustain the forces their powers generate. These adaptations come at a cost: chronic inflammation, accelerated tissue wear, organ enlargement, and fibrosis.

Much of the current understanding derives from autopsy studies. The autopsy of Michael Thompson (codename "Goliath"), a registered superhuman with super strength who died of apparent multiple organ failure at age 35, stands as one of the most detailed examinations on record.

## Mechanics

### Skeletal Adaptations

Metahumans whose powers involve extraordinary physical force exhibit pronounced skeletal reinforcement. Cortical bone thickness increases significantly beyond human norms, and trabecular (spongy) bone develops a unique reinforced lattice structure capable of withstanding forces that would shatter baseline human bones. Load-bearing bones such as the femurs, vertebrae, and pelvis show the most dramatic changes. Joint spaces, however, tend to narrow, and articular cartilage shows accelerated degradation - evidence that the skeleton's adaptation to force generation comes at the expense of long-term joint health. Numerous healed microfractures and stress fractures accumulate throughout the skeleton over time.

### Muscular Adaptations

The muscular system undergoes perhaps the most dramatic transformation. Muscle fibers become extraordinarily dense, with novel myofibril arrangements and a greatly elevated concentration of mitochondria to supply the energy demands of superhuman force output. Sarcomere structure deviates from the baseline human pattern, likely enabling far greater force generation per fiber. Tendons and ligaments thicken and reinforce themselves to a degree more commonly associated with large terrestrial mammals than with humans. Chronic micro-tearing and rapid healing cycles leave a record of scar tissue throughout the musculature, indicating the body is in a state of continuous self-repair.

### Cardiovascular Adaptations

The heart undergoes significant hypertrophy, with documented cases showing cardiac mass nearly double that of an average adult male. The left ventricle wall thickens to support increased output, and heart valves enlarge to handle greater blood volume. The coronary arteries widen and develop reinforced walls to accommodate elevated blood flow, with the aorta and major vessels similarly expanding. Despite these adaptations, the cardiovascular system remains vulnerable to atherosclerosis and focal fibrosis of the myocardium, suggesting that the heart's adaptive capacity has limits.

### Respiratory Adaptations

Lung capacity increases substantially through an elevated number of alveoli and enhanced elastic recoil. The diaphragm thickens and expands its attachment surface area for more forceful contractions, while the intercostal muscles hypertrophy and the rib cage itself becomes denser and more robust. Microscopic examination has revealed chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in pulmonary tissue, indicating that even the respiratory system suffers from the strain of sustained superhuman activity.

### Metabolic and Organ Adaptations

The liver, kidneys, and spleen all enlarge in response to increased metabolic demand, with elevated mitochondrial concentration and specialized enzyme production observed at the cellular level. The gastrointestinal tract develops thickened walls and enhanced absorption capacity to meet caloric and nutrient requirements. The endocrine system, particularly the adrenal glands and thyroid, becomes hyperplastic and shows evidence of chronic overstimulation - a reflection of the body's persistent state of heightened physiological demand.

### Cumulative Health Costs

The systemic pattern is adaptation followed by degradation. Chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and cellular damage accumulate over time, and metahuman bodies exist in a state of constant physiological strain. This cumulative burden likely contributes to premature death in metahumans with physically demanding powers.

## History

Superhuman anatomy remains a young discipline, limited by the rarity of metahuman autopsies and the variability across power types.

The landmark autopsy of Michael Thompson ("Goliath") was conducted on June 23, 2024, by Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Samantha Nguyen. Thompson was found deceased in his residence after dying of apparent natural causes. His autopsy provided detailed documentation of the physiological adaptations and health toll associated with sustained superhuman ability use. Dr. Nguyen's report called for further research into long-term effects and the development of tailored medical interventions.

## Implications

The evidence that powers impose a cumulative physiological toll challenges the assumption that superhuman bodies are uniformly resilient. Metahuman patients require clinicians who understand their altered physiology and can anticipate specific patterns of wear, inflammation, and organ stress by power type.

From a policy perspective, heroes who serve through physically demanding powers may be shortening their own lives, raising ethical questions about the expectations placed on registered superhumans and the adequacy of support systems available to them.

## Classification / Taxonomy

Superhuman anatomical adaptations can be broadly categorized by the organ system affected:

| System | Key Adaptations | Associated Risks |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Skeletal | Thickened cortical bone, reinforced trabecular lattice, robust joints | Narrowed joint spaces, accelerated cartilage wear, accumulated microfractures |
| Muscular | Dense fibers, novel sarcomere structure, elevated mitochondria, thickened tendons | Chronic micro-tearing, scar tissue buildup, continuous repair cycles |
| Cardiovascular | Cardiac hypertrophy, enlarged valves and vessels, widened coronary arteries | Atherosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis |
| Respiratory | Increased alveoli, enhanced elastic recoil, hypertrophied diaphragm and intercostals | Chronic pulmonary inflammation, oxidative stress |
| Metabolic/Organ | Enlarged liver, kidneys, and spleen; enhanced GI absorption; endocrine hyperplasia | Chronic organ overstimulation, elevated cellular turnover |

The specific adaptations observed in any given metahuman depend on the nature and demands of their powers. The taxonomy above is derived primarily from the study of super-strength-type abilities (Gigant category under the PERKS system) and may not generalize to all metahuman power types.

## Trivia

- Thompson's autopsy documented a body weight of approximately 375 pounds at a height of 6'7", with musculature described as extraordinarily dense to the touch.
- Despite his superhuman durability, Thompson's body bore numerous scars from combat injuries alongside stretch marks attributed to rapid muscle growth.
- Dr. Samantha Nguyen described Thompson's physiological adaptations as "truly unprecedented" and "both awe-inspiring and deeply unsettling."
