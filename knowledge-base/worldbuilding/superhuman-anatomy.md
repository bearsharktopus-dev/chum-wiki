## Overview

Superhuman anatomy refers to the constellation of physiological changes observed in the bodies of metahumans whose powers impose significant physical demands. Unlike baseline humans, metahumans with abilities such as super strength undergo radical internal restructuring across nearly every organ system -- including the skeletal, muscular, cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine systems -- in order to sustain the forces their powers generate.

These adaptations, while remarkable in scope, are not without cost. Post-mortem examination of metahuman subjects has revealed patterns of chronic inflammation, accelerated tissue wear, organ enlargement, and fibrosis that suggest the body pays a steep price for the transformations it undergoes. The field of superhuman anatomy seeks to document and understand these changes in order to inform specialized medical care for the metahuman population.

Much of the current medical understanding of superhuman anatomy is derived from autopsy studies, as the rarity and diversity of metahuman physiology makes large-scale clinical research difficult. The autopsy of Michael Thompson (codename "Goliath"), a registered superhuman with super strength who died of apparent multiple organ failure at age 35, stands as one of the most detailed examinations of these adaptations on record.

## Mechanics

### Skeletal Adaptations

Metahumans whose powers involve extraordinary physical force exhibit pronounced skeletal reinforcement. Cortical bone thickness increases significantly beyond human norms, and trabecular (spongy) bone develops a unique reinforced lattice structure capable of withstanding forces that would shatter baseline human bones. Load-bearing bones such as the femurs, vertebrae, and pelvis show the most dramatic changes. Joint spaces, however, tend to narrow, and articular cartilage shows accelerated degradation -- evidence that the skeleton's adaptation to force generation comes at the expense of long-term joint health. Numerous healed microfractures and stress fractures accumulate throughout the skeleton over time.

### Muscular Adaptations

The muscular system undergoes perhaps the most dramatic transformation. Muscle fibers become extraordinarily dense, with novel myofibril arrangements and a greatly elevated concentration of mitochondria to supply the energy demands of superhuman force output. Sarcomere structure deviates from the baseline human pattern, likely enabling far greater force generation per fiber. Tendons and ligaments thicken and reinforce themselves to a degree more commonly associated with large terrestrial mammals than with humans. Chronic micro-tearing and rapid healing cycles leave a record of scar tissue throughout the musculature, indicating the body is in a state of continuous self-repair.

### Cardiovascular Adaptations

The heart undergoes significant hypertrophy, with documented cases showing cardiac mass nearly double that of an average adult male. The left ventricle wall thickens to support increased output, and heart valves enlarge to handle greater blood volume. The coronary arteries widen and develop reinforced walls to accommodate elevated blood flow, with the aorta and major vessels similarly expanding. Despite these adaptations, the cardiovascular system remains vulnerable to atherosclerosis and focal fibrosis of the myocardium, suggesting that the heart's adaptive capacity has limits.

### Respiratory Adaptations

Lung capacity increases substantially through an elevated number of alveoli and enhanced elastic recoil. The diaphragm thickens and expands its attachment surface area for more forceful contractions, while the intercostal muscles hypertrophy and the rib cage itself becomes denser and more robust. Microscopic examination has revealed chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in pulmonary tissue, indicating that even the respiratory system suffers from the strain of sustained superhuman activity.

### Metabolic and Organ Adaptations

The liver, kidneys, and spleen all enlarge in response to increased metabolic demand, with elevated mitochondrial concentration and specialized enzyme production observed at the cellular level. The gastrointestinal tract develops thickened walls and enhanced absorption capacity to meet caloric and nutrient requirements. The endocrine system, particularly the adrenal glands and thyroid, becomes hyperplastic and shows evidence of chronic overstimulation -- a reflection of the body's persistent state of heightened physiological demand.

### Cumulative Health Costs

The systemic pattern across all organ systems is one of adaptation followed by degradation. Chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and cellular damage accumulate over time, and the accelerated wear on joints combined with repeated micro-trauma indicates that metahuman bodies exist in a state of constant physiological strain. This cumulative burden has been identified as a likely contributing factor to premature death in metahumans with physically demanding powers.

## History

The systematic study of superhuman anatomy remains a relatively young discipline, developing alongside the broader medical and regulatory infrastructure for metahuman populations. Early understanding was limited by the rarity of metahuman autopsies and the wide variability of powers across individuals, which made generalization difficult.

The autopsy of Michael Thompson ("Goliath"), conducted on June 23, 2024, by Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Samantha Nguyen, represents a landmark case in the field. Thompson, a 35-year-old registered superhuman with super strength, was found deceased in his residence after dying of apparent natural causes. His autopsy revealed the full extent of physiological adaptation associated with sustained superhuman ability use and provided detailed documentation of the health toll such adaptations can exact. Dr. Nguyen's report explicitly called for further research into the long-term effects of superhuman powers on health and longevity, as well as the development of tailored medical interventions for metahuman patients.

## Implications

The findings of superhuman anatomy research carry significant consequences for metahuman healthcare, public policy, and the broader understanding of what superhuman abilities cost the individuals who bear them. The evidence that powers impose a cumulative physiological toll -- potentially contributing to organ failure and premature death -- challenges any assumption that superhuman bodies are uniformly resilient or self-sustaining.

For the medical profession, these findings underscore the need for specialized healthcare protocols for metahumans, a need already partially addressed through the benefits extended to Licensed Vigilantes and Registered Superhuman Entities under the LUMA and PERKS frameworks. Metahuman patients require clinicians who understand their radically altered physiology and can anticipate the specific patterns of wear, inflammation, and organ stress associated with different power types.

From a policy perspective, the reality of superhuman anatomy reinforces the importance of monitoring and supporting the metahuman population rather than simply deploying them. Heroes such as Goliath who serve society through physically demanding powers may be shortening their own lives in the process, raising ethical questions about the expectations placed on registered superhumans and the adequacy of the support systems available to them.

## Classification / Taxonomy

Superhuman anatomical adaptations can be broadly categorized by the organ system affected:

| System | Key Adaptations | Associated Risks |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Skeletal | Thickened cortical bone, reinforced trabecular lattice, robust joints | Narrowed joint spaces, accelerated cartilage wear, accumulated microfractures |
| Muscular | Dense fibers, novel sarcomere structure, elevated mitochondria, thickened tendons | Chronic micro-tearing, scar tissue buildup, continuous repair cycles |
| Cardiovascular | Cardiac hypertrophy, enlarged valves and vessels, widened coronary arteries | Atherosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis |
| Respiratory | Increased alveoli, enhanced elastic recoil, hypertrophied diaphragm and intercostals | Chronic pulmonary inflammation, oxidative stress |
| Metabolic/Organ | Enlarged liver, kidneys, and spleen; enhanced GI absorption; endocrine hyperplasia | Chronic organ overstimulation, elevated cellular turnover |

The specific adaptations observed in any given metahuman depend on the nature and demands of their powers. The taxonomy above is derived primarily from the study of super-strength-type abilities (Gigant category under the PERKS system) and may not generalize to all metahuman power types.

## Trivia

- The autopsy of Michael Thompson ("Goliath") documented a body weight of approximately 375 pounds at a height of 6'7", with musculature described as extraordinarily dense to the touch.
- Thompson's heart weighed nearly twice that of a normal adult male, making it one of the most extreme cases of superhuman cardiac hypertrophy on record.
- His tendons and ligaments were compared in thickness and reinforcement to those of a much larger animal rather than a human.
- Despite his superhuman durability, Thompson's body bore numerous scars from combat injuries alongside stretch marks attributed to rapid muscle growth.
- Dr. Samantha Nguyen described the extent of Thompson's physiological adaptations as "truly unprecedented" and "both awe-inspiring and deeply unsettling."
- Thompson was only 35 years old at the time of death, highlighting the potential for drastically reduced lifespan among metahumans with physically taxing powers.
