## Overview

Metahuman regeneration is the capacity of certain metahumans to recover from injury at rates far exceeding baseline humans, from rapid closure of minor lacerations to complete reformation of severed limbs. Most regenerators heal at 8-10x the normal rate, though outliers exist on both ends.

The defining feature is the "template" - an intrinsic biological blueprint to which a regenerator's body conforms following any deviation. Unlike conventional wound repair, which produces scar tissue, template-guided regeneration returns the body to a pre-established configuration. This has profound implications for medicine, emergency response, pharmacology, body autonomy, and psychological well-being.

The NSRA classifies regenerators into three types: Holistic Template Regenerators (HTR), Localized Template Regenerators (LTR), and Enhanced Natural Regenerators (ENR), each demanding different medical protocols.

## Mechanics

### Wound Healing Process

Regeneration operates through the same four stages as baseline wound healing - hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and maturation - but each stage is dramatically compressed and may overlap.

- **Hemostasis** - Near-instantaneous clot formation minimizes blood loss.
- **Inflammation** - Condensed into a brief, efficient window while retaining its protective function.
- **Proliferation** - Exponentially increased cell production; the stage showing the most dramatic variation from baseline humans, with visibly accelerated tissue rebuilding.
- **Maturation** - The remodeling phase, normally taking months or years, completes in a fraction of the time.

### The Template

The template separates true regeneration from merely accelerated healing. First theorized by Dr. Lillian Haversham in her 1998 paper "Beyond Traditional Healing: The Metahuman Physiological Blueprint," it functions as an internal standard directing restoration toward a pre-established configuration rather than repairing based on current state.

Key characteristics:

- **Aging interaction** - For most, the template evolves with natural aging. Some possess static templates causing chronological/physiological age disparities after healing events.
- **Body composition** - Generally accommodates natural fluctuations, but extreme deviations may be "corrected" during regeneration.
- **Scar tissue** - Standard templates omit scar formation. A subset possess scar-sensitive templates allowing scars to persist.
- **External modifications** - Tattoos, piercings, and surgical alterations are often reversed as deviations. Long-standing modifications may eventually integrate into the template.

### Biomass Source

The biomass source fueling regeneration remains an open question. Four hypotheses exist:

1. **Endogenous Biomass Conversion** - Breaking down existing body mass (fat, muscle) for repair, causing temporary weight loss and high caloric demand.
2. **AOM Integration** - Harnessing transient "false matter" (Anomalously Originated Material) to temporarily replace lost tissue, later replaced by natural tissue.
3. **Interdimensional Mass Exchange** - Drawing biomass from alternate dimensions (fringe; largely untestable).
4. **Enhanced Cellular Efficiency** - Hyper-efficient metabolism generating biomass rapidly from minimal nutrients.

Growing evidence supports AOM integration in at least some regenerators, potentially explaining how rapid restoration occurs without violating mass conservation.

### Physiological Interactions

Heightened cellular turnover produces distinctive pharmacological and metabolic profiles:

- **Drug metabolism** - Accelerated absorption and elimination often require more frequent or higher dosing. Elevated hepatic enzyme activity complicates drug interactions.
- **Toxin processing** - More efficient detoxification provides wider safety margins, though extreme exposure can still overwhelm the system.
- **Substance response** - Alcohol and psychoactive substances produce diminished or unpredictable effects. Dependency can develop faster, and withdrawal may intensify despite shorter detoxification.
- **Nutritional demands** - Increased nutrient turnover often necessitates supplementation or specialized products like "Regenerator Nutrient Bars."

### Interaction with Disease

Regeneration is most effective against cellular or tissue damage and does not function as a general-purpose cure:

- **Infections** - Regenerators remain susceptible; rapid turnover speeds tissue damage recovery but does not prevent infection or enhance immunity.
- **Cancer** - Cannot identify or eliminate malignant cells, though secondary necrosis and tissue damage may be attenuated.
- **Autoimmune disorders** - Accelerates recovery from immune-mediated destruction but may create damage-repair cycles if untreated.
- **Degenerative diseases** - Conditions like Alzheimer's or muscular dystrophy may progress more slowly due to continuous cell replacement, though root causes remain unaffected.
- **Metabolic disorders** - Conditions like diabetes fall outside regenerative scope, though secondary complications (e.g., diabetic ulcers) may benefit.

## History

Systematic study began in the early 1990s. Clinicians initially drew analogies to amphibian regeneration, but metahuman healing's speed and fidelity quickly outstripped those comparisons.

Dr. Lillian Haversham's 1998 paper provided the critical breakthrough, identifying that regenerators revert to a pre-established physiological state rather than merely healing. Her template theory became foundational.

The NSRA's First Responder Field Guide for Regenerative Metahumans (current revision 2023.4, developed with the American College of Emergency Physicians) codified the three-type classification and type-specific protocols used nationwide.

The AOM integration hypothesis gained traction following Chen and Gupta's 2022 paper. The vermiform appendage - a worm-like organ discovered in the 1990s during autopsies of AOM-generating metahumans - added another dimension, as the vermiform itself exhibits extreme regenerative properties and template-like behavior.

## Implications

### Medical Practice

Regeneration alters standard care: sutures and staples may need early removal to prevent embedding, casts are generally replaced by functional braces, and pharmacological treatment requires careful dose adjustment. Standard immunization schedules remain necessary, as regeneration does not confer immune enhancement.

### Emergency Response

HTRs often need only metabolic support and foreign object removal. LTRs require differential treatment - template-covered systems self-repair while others receive conventional care. ENRs present the greatest urgency: injuries must be properly aligned within a narrow window to prevent permanent malunion.

Common field complications include metabolic depletion (healing slowdown, pallor, confusion), template conflicts (pain and discoloration), healing seizures (muscle spasms during intense regeneration), and vermiform impairment (irregular patterns and stalls).

### Psychological and Social Impact

Regeneration eliminates physical scars but not psychological trauma. Pain perception remains intact during healing, and severe regeneration can be profoundly distressing. The template's reversal of elective modifications raises bodily autonomy issues, and regenerators with static age templates face identity difficulties from chronological/apparent age disparities. Regular psychological counseling is recommended.

### Nutrition and Metabolism

Regenerators have substantially increased caloric needs following significant injury, driving development of products like Regenerator Nutrient Bars and the standardized superhuman nutritional support protocol (SNP-R4) for field treatment.

## Classification / Taxonomy

### Regenerator Types (NSRA Emergency Classification)

| Type | Designation | Common Name | Prevalence | Template | Key Characteristics |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Type 1 | Holistic Template Regenerator (HTR) | Perfect Regenerator | ~60% of regenerators | Full-body template | Complete template-based healing across all biological systems; restores to pre-injury state without intervention |
| Type 2 | Localized Template Regenerator (LTR) | Semi-Perfect Regenerator | ~10% of regenerators | Partial template | Template-based healing limited to specific systems or body regions; non-template areas heal conventionally |
| Type 3 | Enhanced Natural Regenerator (ENR) | Imperfect Regenerator | ~30% of regenerators | None | Accelerated natural healing without template guidance; follows normal healing pathways at enhanced speed; retains scarring |

### LTR Common Template Systems

| System | Frequency Among LTRs |
|--------|---------------------|
| Skeletal | 38% |
| Integumentary (skin) | 27% |
| Cardiovascular | 15% |
| Nervous | 12% |
| Other/Mixed | 8% |

### ENR Healing Rate Subclassifications

| Subtype | Healing Rate | Treatment Window for Alignment |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Mild ENR | 5-10x normal | 60-120 minutes |
| Moderate ENR | 11-30x normal | 10-59 minutes |
| Rapid ENR | 31-100x normal | Generally under 10 minutes |

### Variations in Regenerative Expression

- **Localized vs. Systemic** -- Some regenerators exhibit healing restricted to certain body parts, while others benefit from body-wide regenerative capacity.
- **Scarless vs. Scar-forming** -- Determined by template sensitivity to scar tissue and collagen remodeling behavior.
- **Threshold-Limited** -- Regeneration activates only above a certain injury severity; minor wounds may heal at normal rates.
- **Environmentally Dependent** -- Healing speed influenced by humidity, atmospheric composition, or light wavelength exposure.
- **Selective Tissue** -- Regeneration limited to specific tissue types (muscle, nerve, bone, etc.), potentially producing incomplete wound healing.
- **Adaptive** -- Repeated exposure to specific hazards (toxins, temperature extremes) causes the regenerative process to confer increased resistance over time.
