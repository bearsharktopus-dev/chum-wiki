## Overview

Metahumans with medically applicable abilities have fundamentally transformed healthcare. Powers from tissue generation and pathogen elimination to accelerated healing and teleportation are now integrated into clinical settings, emergency response, and specialized fields.

Formal hospital integration began in 2003 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. The 2014 pilot at St. John's Hospital in New York City embedded metahuman healers across non-emergency departments, demonstrating measurable improvements in outcomes and reduced stays, establishing a model for nationwide expansion.

The ISC maintains ethical guidelines for metahuman medical practice, while the Superhuman Healthcare Act of 2021 prohibits healthcare discrimination against superhumans. Licensed Vigilantes and Registered Superhuman Entities access specialized care accommodating their physiology and secret identity requirements.

## Mechanics

### Power Classification in Medical Contexts

All eight PERKS categories contain powers with medical utility:

### Adjust (A)

Modifies existing physiological variables. Applications: temperature regulation during surgery, bone density manipulation for fracture repair, blood pressure control in cardiac emergencies. Cannot generate new tissue or eliminate pathogens.

### Brain (B)

Enhanced cognitive and sensory capabilities. Applications: rapid data assimilation for diagnostics, biochemistry intelligence enabling novel medication development, and heightened sensory perception detecting physiological changes that equipment may miss.

### Create (C)

Generates Anomalously Originated Material (AOM). Applications: tissue generation for grafts, water for emergency hydration, and oxygen for respiratory support. Critical limitation: no recorded Create-type power operates at the microscopic level, and AOM degrades over time.

### Delete (D)

Erases or negates from existence. Unlike Create, Delete can operate microscopically, making it valuable for targeted pathogen elimination (including antibiotic-resistant strains), cancer treatment, and toxin removal. Rare among the metahuman population.

### Employ (E)

Adds new parameters to biological systems. Applications: accelerating natural healing, enhancing rehabilitation performance, and augmenting sensory perception for diagnostics. Distinct from Adjust in introducing new attributes rather than tuning existing ones.

### Filch (F)

Extracts specific properties without total destruction. Primarily supportive: color transfer for scar reconstruction, sound absorption for quiet healing environments, and friction reduction for patient mobility.

### Gigant (G)

Extraordinary physical/biological traits. Contributions: heavy equipment assistance, biological material donation from self-healers (with cross-type compatibility concerns), and hazardous environment medical work.

### Hopper (H)

Teleportation, super-speed, and flight for emergency logistics: rapid patient transport, time-critical organ delivery, and remote/disaster area access.

## History

Metahuman healers appeared following the genesis births of 1982, initially met with a mix of reverence and suspicion. Scientific validation gradually shifted institutional attitudes.

Key milestones: Northwestern Memorial Hospital's 2003 formal integration (first hospital to hire a metahuman practitioner); the 2014 St. John's Hospital pilot placing healers in pediatrics and orthopedics; the 2017 Mexico City earthquake (seismic manipulation stabilized structures while healers treated on-site); and the 2020 London terrorist attack demonstrating metahuman first-responder value.

Legislatively, protections built from the Stewart administration's 2013 ACA revisions through the 2018 Health and Superhuman Services Act to the Superhuman Healthcare Act of 2021.

## Implications

### Impact on Healthcare Delivery

Metahuman practitioners have expanded treatable conditions, reduced recovery times, and in some cases eliminated the need for conventional treatments. Surgery, psychiatry, and palliative care have been particularly affected by abilities like microscopic vision, empathy enhancement, and emotion modulation.

### Access Disparities

Metahuman healers are concentrated in major population centers, creating geographic care disparities and raising concerns about a two-tiered system.

### Workforce and Institutional Effects

Integration has generated tensions with the traditional workforce. Dependency on metahuman healers risks devaluing conventional methods, while healers themselves face burnout. Institutions have developed new protocols, consent procedures, and staffing models.

### Ethical and Regulatory Challenges

Key concerns include informed consent, potential abuse of powers, whether healers should be compelled to practice, and equitable resource distribution. The ISC continuously updates governing guidelines.

### Economic Dimensions

VC investment in metahuman healthcare surged 40%, averaging 25% ROI with over $200 million per major company. A civilian metahuman may spend approximately $5,300 annually on medical expenses, while complex-condition individuals face $20,000 or more.

## Classification / Taxonomy

### Medical Applications by PERKS Category

| PERKS Category | Primary Medical Role | Example Applications | Key Limitations |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Adjust (A) | Physiological variable modification | Temperature regulation, blood pressure control, bone density manipulation | Cannot create new tissue or eliminate pathogens |
| Brain (B) | Diagnostics and research | Enhanced memory for patient histories, metahuman biochemistry intelligence, heightened sensory diagnostics | Cognitive rather than therapeutic; supports rather than replaces treatment |
| Create (C) | Material and substance generation | Tissue grafts (AOM), emergency hydration, supplemental oxygen | Macroscopic only; AOM degrades over time |
| Delete (D) | Targeted elimination | Pathogen destruction, tumor eradication, toxin removal | Rare among population; precision required to avoid collateral damage |
| Employ (E) | Biological augmentation | Healing acceleration, physical rehabilitation enhancement, sensory augmentation | Risk of complications from overly rapid healing; ethical concerns around enhancement |
| Filch (F) | Property manipulation and environment control | Scar color restoration, noise reduction in clinical settings, friction management | Primarily supportive; limited direct therapeutic value |
| Gigant (G) | Physical support and biological research | Heavy lifting, tissue/blood donation from self-healers, hazardous environment medicine | Ethical concerns with cross-type biological material transfer |
| Hopper (H) | Emergency logistics and access | Patient transport, organ delivery, remote area medical access | Primarily logistical rather than therapeutic |

### Healthcare Settings

| Setting | Metahuman Role | Notable Examples |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Emergency Response | Disaster relief, trauma stabilization, rapid transport | 2017 Mexico City earthquake, 2020 London attack |
| General Practice | Integrated hospital care, reduced recovery times | St. John's Hospital NYC pilot (2014) |
| Surgery | Microscopic vision, precision energy control, tissue generation | Enhanced precision and reduced surgical risk |
| Psychiatry | Empathy enhancement, memory visualization, emotion modulation | Deeper diagnostic insight and personalized treatment |
| Palliative Care | Pain management, emotional support, comfort enhancement | Improved quality of life for terminal patients |

## Trivia

- The underground metahuman community operates "shadow clinics" providing off-the-books care for unregistered individuals who cannot access the formal system.
- The "mob doctor" phenomenon describes how licensed professionals are gradually drawn into providing off-books care for criminal metahumans, starting with a single cash-paying patient and escalating into full dependency on the criminal network.
