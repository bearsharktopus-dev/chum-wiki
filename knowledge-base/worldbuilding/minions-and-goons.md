## Overview

The term "goon economy" refers to the expansive labor market created by supervillain organizations operating across the United States. Conservative estimates place direct employment by these organizations at 200,000 to 300,000 Americans, with perhaps five times that number economically dependent on their operations through indirect employment and family ties. The total economic footprint rivals that of major industrial sectors, and in cities such as Philadelphia and Baltimore, villain organizations rank as the third or fourth largest employer when direct and indirect employment are combined.

Far from the popular image of costumed henchmen engaged in theatrical combat, the majority of goon economy workers occupy mundane roles. Many are employed through ostensibly legitimate business fronts and may not initially realize they work for a criminal enterprise. The system persists because it addresses fundamental gaps in the legitimate labor market: competitive wages, comprehensive benefits, legal defense funds, and structured protocols for surviving hero encounters. The goon economy represents one of the most significant unintended consequences of the superhuman era, where the economic pressures of ordinary life intersect with the operational needs of powers-based crime.

## Mechanics

### Compensation and Benefits

Street-level employees in major villain organizations earn between $45,000 and $65,000 annually, compared to $35,000 to $45,000 for comparable private security work in the legitimate sector. Health insurance coverage averages approximately $12,000 per employee per year -- nearly double standard corporate plans -- reflecting the elevated hazard rates associated with the work. Additionally, off-books medical practitioners provide thousands of dollars in supplementary care value that does not appear in official figures.

Legal defense is a major operational expense and retention tool. Organizations such as the Infinite Copse maintain legal retainer funds in excess of $50 million annually for employee defense alone. This investment serves a dual purpose: it ensures loyalty among the workforce and significantly reduces turnover, as employees recognize the personal value of guaranteed legal representation.

### Recruitment and Integration

Recruitment into the goon economy rarely involves a deliberate decision to become a criminal operative. Three primary pathways have been identified by researchers:

- **Economic Pressure** -- In cities with active supervillain presence, these organizations frequently control major employment sectors such as construction, shipping, and waste management. For many workers, employment with a villain-affiliated business is the most accessible or only viable option.
- **Systemic Integration** -- Workers commonly enter through legitimate subsidiary businesses and become gradually enmeshed in illegal operations. The transition from legal employee to criminal participant is often so incremental that no single decision point exists.
- **Risk-Reward Calculation** -- For workers living paycheck to paycheck, the combination of above-market wages, guaranteed medical care, and legal protection outweighs the elevated occupational risk.

### Operational Protocols

Supervillain organizations maintain structured procedures for hero encounters that often surpass the preparedness of legitimate businesses in superhuman-active areas. Most rank-and-file employees never directly engage with heroes or law enforcement in a combat capacity. Annual fatality rates for "muscle" positions average 0.8% -- higher than the construction industry's 0.1% but substantially lower than public perception suggests. Organizations treat employee deaths as operationally costly and maintain active protocols to minimize confrontations.

### Industry Penetration

In cities with major villain presence, criminal organizations control significant portions of key industries:

| Sector | Estimated Control |
|--------|------------------|
| Port labor | 30-40% |
| Construction contracts | 25-35% |
| Waste management | 40-50% |
| Local small businesses (via protection rackets) | 15-20% |

### Medical Infrastructure

The goon economy sustains a parallel medical system staffed by compromised physicians. A common pattern involves a private-practice doctor accepting a single off-hours, cash-paying patient, then gradually acquiring an entire clientele of criminal employees. As legitimate patients depart due to the changed atmosphere of the practice, the physician becomes financially dependent on the criminal organization. Requests escalate from standard injury treatment to falsifying medical reports, administering undocumented medications, and providing house calls for senior operatives wounded in hero encounters. Departure from this arrangement is difficult; physicians who wish to leave must negotiate with the organization and typically accept conditions of permanent silence.

## History

The goon economy evolved from traditional organized crime infrastructure, which generated an estimated $150 billion annually in North America prior to the superhuman era. As powers-based criminal organizations such as the Infinite Copse and the Lakefront Syndicate emerged, they absorbed and expanded existing criminal networks rather than replacing them. Conservative estimates suggest these organizations increased traditional criminal revenue streams by 60 to 80 percent.

The Big Raid of 2018 -- a global coordinated operation led by GESSOC against superhuman criminal networks -- dismantled many established criminal hierarchies. However, the resulting power vacuum accelerated rather than diminished the goon economy. New organizations, including the Infinite Copse on the West Coast, arose to fill the void. These successor groups adopted more sophisticated models of integration with legitimate industry, operating tech companies, controlling unions, and investing in community infrastructure. The post-Raid criminal landscape shifted toward decentralized, faceless syndicates with less hierarchical structure but deeper economic roots in their communities.

In Los Angeles alone, the Infinite Copse is estimated to provide direct employment to approximately 60,000 people. When indirect employment and family dependents are included, roughly 300,000 people in the city are economically tied to a single villain organization -- a level of integration that makes conventional law enforcement dismantlement impractical without catastrophic economic consequences for the surrounding community.

## Implications

### Economic Impact

The goon economy functions as a de facto social safety net in underserved urban areas, offering employment, healthcare, and legal protection where legitimate institutions fail to compete. This creates a paradox for policymakers: dismantling criminal organizations would devastate local economies, yet tolerating them entrenches criminal infrastructure. As MIT economist Dr. Sarah Chen has argued, the issue is fundamentally one of economic competition rather than law enforcement -- until legitimate employers can match the compensation and benefits offered by villain organizations, the goon economy will continue to grow.

### Social and Psychological Effects

Criminal organizations offer workers clear advancement paths, protection from both heroes and rival groups, and a sense of communal belonging. These organizations fill gaps in the social safety net that legitimate institutions leave open. The psychological cost, however, is significant: workers and affiliated professionals such as doctors report chronic anxiety, ethical compromise, isolation from mainstream social networks, and difficulty exiting the system even when they wish to leave.

### Law Enforcement Challenges

The deep economic integration of villain organizations into urban economies makes traditional enforcement strategies -- raids, asset seizures, mass arrests -- counterproductive at scale. The post-Big Raid period demonstrated that destroying criminal hierarchies without addressing underlying economic conditions simply creates power vacuums that are rapidly filled by new, often more ruthless organizations. Law enforcement agencies increasingly recognize the goon economy as a systemic economic problem rather than a purely criminal one.

### Medical Ethics

The absorption of private physicians into criminal medical infrastructure raises unresolved questions about medical ethics, patient confidentiality, and professional responsibility. Doctors who enter the system often do so through individually defensible decisions -- treating a patient who pays cash, maintaining confidentiality -- that cumulatively result in deep complicity with criminal operations.

## Classification / Taxonomy

### Employee Tiers

| Tier | Role | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Street-level muscle | Security / enforcement | Direct physical security and intimidation; the most visible tier and the one most likely to encounter heroes |
| Legitimate-front employees | Business operations | Workers in ostensibly legal subsidiaries (tech, construction, shipping) who may or may not be aware of criminal affiliation |
| Specialized contractors | Medical, legal, technical | Physicians, lawyers, and technical specialists retained for their professional expertise; often drawn in gradually |
| Community-facing operatives | Outreach / integration | Workers in organization-funded community centers, local businesses, and civic programs that build public goodwill |

### Notable Organizations Referenced

| Organization | Region | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Infinite Copse | West Coast (Los Angeles) | Arose after the Big Raid; operates legitimate tech companies, controls unions, invests in community centers; estimated 60,000 direct employees in LA |
| Lakefront Syndicate | Chicago | Operated legitimate business fronts alongside criminal operations; maintained dedicated medical staff; one of few organizations to survive the Big Raid |

## Trivia

- The phrase "goon economy" originated in academic economics literature before entering common usage in journalism and policy discussions.
- The 0.8% annual fatality rate for muscle positions, while higher than construction work, is low enough that villain organizations can credibly market themselves as offering manageable occupational risk.
- The Infinite Copse's $50 million annual legal defense fund for employees exceeds the total legal budgets of many midsize corporations.
- Many goon economy workers describe their entry into criminal employment using the same language as workers in legitimate industries who discover their employer has unethical practices -- a gradual realization rather than a conscious choice.
- Off-books medical practitioners serving the goon economy often lose their legitimate patient base entirely, creating a one-way dependency that mirrors the experience of their non-medical counterparts.
