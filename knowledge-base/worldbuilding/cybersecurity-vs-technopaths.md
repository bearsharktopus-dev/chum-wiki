## Overview

Anti-technopathic cybersecurity refers to the physical, electromagnetic, and circuit-level countermeasures designed to protect electronic hardware and data from technopathic metahumans. Conventional digital security is insufficient against individuals who can interface with or destroy electronic systems using powers alone, so a parallel discipline of hardware-oriented defense has emerged.

The field draws on dynology's Principle of Least Resistance, which holds that approximately 80% of superpowers follow predictable patterns. Because most technopathic abilities fall into a small number of well-documented types, defenders can focus hardening efforts on a manageable set of threat vectors. The discipline is largely community-driven, with knowledge shared through online guides, IRC chatrooms, HIRC channels, and hardware forums.

## Mechanics

### Common Technopathic Threat Vectors

Technopathic abilities generally fall into four operational categories, each requiring distinct countermeasures:

- **Direct Electronic Manipulation** - Interfacing with electronic devices without physical input to toggle, alter settings, or damage circuitry. The most common form of technopathy.
- **Data Manipulation** - Reading, rewriting, or deleting digital data without physical access. The most severe privacy threat, as it bypasses all software-layer security.
- **Signal Hijacking** - Intercepting, disrupting, or spoofing wireless communications, including eavesdropping and injecting false transmissions.
- **Power Surge Generation** - Generating electrical surges that short-circuit or permanently damage components. Functionally equivalent to a targeted electromagnetic pulse.

### Physical Hardening

Physical hardening reinforces device structural integrity against telekinetic manipulation and tampering:

- **Case Reinforcement** - Replacing plastic housings with metal, heavy-duty polymer, or impact-resistant composites.
- **Shock Absorption** - Rubberized or gel-based internal padding to protect components from telekinetic vibration and impact.
- **Structural Reinforcement** - Strengthening vulnerable corners and edges with additional padding or plating.
- **Anti-Tamper Measures** - Tamper-proof screws and security seals to detect unauthorized access.

### Electromagnetic and Circuit Protection

These countermeasures address electronic and electromagnetic attack vectors:

- **Circuit Insulation** - Wrapping circuits and wiring in insulating materials to impede direct electronic manipulation.
- **Ferrite Cores and Chokes** - Clamping ferrite components onto cables to filter EMI and reduce technopathic signal injection.
- **Surge Protection** - High-quality surge protectors and UPS systems to absorb power surges before they reach components.
- **EMI Shielding** - Conductive paints, fabrics, or metallic linings to create electromagnetic barriers around devices.
- **Proper Grounding** - Correct grounding provides a safe discharge path for induced electrical currents.

### DIY and Budget Approaches

The community has also developed accessible, low-cost methods using household materials such as metal sheeting, rubber mats, and dense foam. While less robust than commercial alternatives, these provide meaningful protection for individuals who cannot afford specialized gear.

## History

As technopathic abilities became documented through dynology, it became clear that conventional software-focused cybersecurity was inadequate against adversaries who could interface directly with hardware.

The community that formed around this discipline has roots in the early internet, with practitioners like Max "circuitBreaker" Johnson - a veteran of pre-Eternal September IRC culture - contributing guides through online forums. The rise of HIRC expanded the reach of this knowledge-sharing network.

## Implications

- **Consumer Electronics** - Mainstream devices increasingly ship with built-in EMI shielding and surge protection, reflecting market demand created by technopathic threats.
- **Digital Evidence and Law** - Technopathic ability to alter or destroy digital evidence without physical access has forced courts to develop new evidentiary standards and chain-of-custody protocols.
- **Infrastructure Security** - Critical infrastructure including power grids, communication networks, and financial systems must account for technopathic attack vectors beyond standard cybersecurity.
- **Privacy** - Data manipulation technopaths can access data without network connections or physical access, making even air-gapped systems unsafe without physical shielding.
- **Decentralized Systems** - AOM-based computational networks use multi-node trust architectures specifically designed to resist technopathic interference.

## Classification / Taxonomy

### Technopathic Threat Categories

| Category | Mechanism | Primary Risk | Key Countermeasures |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|

| Data Manipulation | Mental access to stored digital information | Data theft, corruption, or deletion | EMI shielding, air-gapping (limited effectiveness), circuit insulation |
| Signal Hijacking | Interception or spoofing of wireless signals | Communications compromise, eavesdropping | Ferrite cores, EMI shielding, conductive enclosures |
| Power Surge Generation | Induced electrical surges through technopathic ability | Component destruction, permanent hardware loss | Surge protectors, UPS systems, proper grounding |

### Countermeasure Tiers

| Tier | Approach | Cost Level | Typical Users |
|------|----------|-----------|---------------|
