## Overview

The Paranormal Entity Rating/Kill Score (PERKS) is the primary framework for classifying and assessing metahuman abilities in the United States. Administered by the NSRA, it serves both strategic and legal functions: tactical intelligence for containment and neutralization, and the regulatory infrastructure governing metahuman activity.

Each metahuman receives a structured classification code and numerical ratings across five scales measuring magnitude, controllability, and danger. A parallel legal framework sorts metahumans into status categories (unlicensed to government-employed) and criminal designations (low-level to Classified Threat Entities).

PERKS documentation is classified; unauthorized dissemination may result in penalty under U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 798.

## Mechanics

### Classification Code Structure

Each power receives a code with five components: primary category letter, power ranking, targeting type, context type, and range type. For example, G4/S/P/T indicates a Gigant-category power at ranking 4, targeting self, physical in context, touch range. Each individual power receives its own classification.

### Primary Categories (A-H)

Eight categories describe the fundamental nature of an ability:

- **Adjust (A)** - Modifies existing variables without creating or eliminating.
- **Brain (B)** - Superior cognitive, sensory, or information processing abilities.
- **Create (C)** - Brings objects, entities, or phenomena into existence, typically macroscopic.
- **Delete (D)** - Erases or negates from existence; functions at both macroscopic and microscopic levels.
- **Employ (E)** - Augments entities by adding new attributes to systems.
- **Filch (F)** - Extracts specific properties from objects or entities without total erasure.
- **Gigant (G)** - Extraordinary physical or biological characteristics, usually active by default.
- **Hopper (H)** - Advanced locomotion: teleportation, flight, or super-speed.

### Targeting Types

Targeting describes what a power affects:

- **Self (S)** - The user.
- **Other (O)** - Other human individuals.
- **Nonsentient (N)** - Animals, plants, and sometimes machines.
- **Inanimate (I)** - Inanimate objects.
- **Environment (E)** - The surrounding environment or nontargeted entities.

### Context Types

Context describes the operational domain:

- **Physical (P)** - Tangible, physical effects.
- **Emotional (E)** - Emotions or emotional processing.
- **Mental (M)** - Cognition, sensory information, or thought processes.
- **Undefined (X)** - Effects outside P/E/M, such as powers affecting other powers.

### Range Types

Range describes effective radius:

- **Touch (T)** - Direct contact or self.
- **Room (R)** - 1-9 meters.
- **Block (B)** - 10-99 meters.
- **Visual (V)** - 100-999 meters.
- **Mile (M)** - 1-9 kilometers.
- **Postmile (P)** - Beyond 9 kilometers.

### Rating Scales

All five scales use a 0-10 integer range:

- **Power Ranking** - Magnitude of ability. 0 = practically normal human; 10 = impossible to replicate, immense, and/or indefensible. Each power receives its own ranking.
- **Control Rating** - Ability to regulate, direct, or suppress. 0 = involuntary/uncontrolled; 10 = full mastery.
- **Hostility Rating** - Antagonism toward state actors. 0 = average law-abiding citizen; 10 = terrorist/anarchistic behavior.
- **Collateral Damage Potential** - Harm potential. 0 = incapable of significant damage; 10 = mass casualties (thousands) and/or billions in property damage.
- **Overall Threat Level** - Aggregate assessment considering all other factors.

## History

The exact establishment date is unknown. PERKS was developed by or for the NSRA alongside its legal classification framework.

The system reflects lessons from catastrophic incidents, particularly the Tesla Incident, which underscored the danger of conventional law enforcement engaging superhumans and contributed to the prevailing policy of allowing superhumans to manage each other.

## Implications

PERKS shapes virtually every aspect of metahuman life. For heroes, it determines legal standing and authorized activity scope. For law enforcement, it provides tactical intelligence for containment strategy, resource allocation, and lethal force authorization.

The LUMA licensing system ($40 initial, $20 biennial renewal) creates a structured legal pathway. Licensed and Registered metahumans receive legal immunity for authorized actions and specialized healthcare.

Criminal classifications allow proportional resource allocation: standard attention for Known Superhuman Criminals, specialized NSRA deployment for Ideological Power Entities, and continuous surveillance with pre-approved lethal force for Classified Threat Entities.

Over two-thirds of the approximately 500,000 U.S. metahumans avoid the hero-villain dynamic entirely, using abilities in the workplace or personal life. PERKS and LUMA accommodate this majority.

## Classification / Taxonomy

### Legal Status Categories

| Classification | Common Name | Proportion | Description | Key Regulatory Actions |
|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Unlicensed Metahuman Entity | Vigilante | ~30% of supers | Possesses abilities but lacks legal authorization to use them publicly or privately | Monitoring and surveillance; fines to criminal charges depending on jurisdiction |
| Licensed Metahuman Entity | Licensed Vigilante | ~60% of supers | Holds a License to Utilize Metahuman Abilities (LUMA); authorized under specific conditions | Scheduled compliance audits; legal immunity within license scope; 2-year renewal cycle |
| Registered Superhuman Entity | Professional Hero | ~10% of supers | Government-employed metahuman with specialized contracts, equipment, and accountability | Mandatory psychological/ethical evaluations; full legal protections and benefits; community service possible for excessive collateral damage |

### Criminal Classifications

| Classification | Proportion | Description | Regulatory Response |
|---------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Known Superhuman Criminal | ~75% of criminal supers | Uses abilities for criminal endeavors, typically non-violent offenses such as theft or vandalism | Standard law enforcement operations; surveillance and data collection |
| Ideological Power Entity | ~25% of criminal supers | Commits crimes to promote an ideology, belief system, or agenda; actions may escalate to violence or large-scale offenses | Prioritized surveillance and intelligence gathering; specialized NSRA unit deployment; interagency counter-terrorism coordination |
| Classified Threat Entity | <1% of criminal supers | Extreme risk to public safety and/or national security; abilities of a magnitude threatening communities, infrastructure, or national stability | Continuous high-level surveillance (satellite, SIGINT); neutralization prioritized over capture; pre-approved lethal force authorization; full interagency collaboration |

## Related Concepts

- **NSRA** - Administers PERKS and governs metahuman regulation.
- **LUMA** - Licensing framework closely integrated with PERKS status classifications.
- **Tesla Incident** - Catastrophic event justifying non-engagement policy by conventional law enforcement.
- **Metahuman Healthcare** - Specialized medical support for Licensed and Registered metahumans.

## Trivia

- LUMA can be obtained through a local NSRA office or arranged through local police agencies in areas without NSRA presence.
