## Overview

Metahuman accommodations encompass the federal programs, employer obligations, and safety protocols supporting individuals whose superhuman abilities impose functional limitations. While public discourse centers on heroes and villains, many of the approximately 500,000 U.S. metahumans contend with abilities that complicate rather than enhance daily life.

The system operates on two tracks. The federal track, administered through the Federal Bureau of Metahuman Affairs and its Conditional Ability Support Program (CASP), provides housing subsidies, containment equipment, medical monitoring, and other direct support. The private-sector track obligates employers to provide reasonable accommodations under the Federal Metahuman Employment Act, integrated with existing ADA compliance infrastructure. Both tracks rely on the NSRA's registration and classification systems for eligibility verification.

These programs reflect the recognition that metahuman conditions are not uniformly advantageous. Powers that fluctuate unpredictably, impose incompatible physiological changes, or create hazardous conditions require institutional responses beyond traditional disability services.

## Mechanics

### Conditional Ability Support Program (CASP)

The CASP is a federal benefits program administered by the Federal Bureau of Metahuman Affairs. Applicants must hold an NSRA registration number and submit Form MH-SSI-401(c), disclosing power classification, manifestation date, and a detailed limitation assessment.

The program recognizes six limitation types:

- **Temporal** - Powers that fluctuate based on time or external factors (diurnal cycles, lunar phases, seasons, weather, or emotional triggers).
- **Control-Related** - Inability to fully regulate power activation or deactivation.
- **Physiological** - Physical changes incompatible with standard human environments.
- **Cognitive** - Mental alterations impacting decision-making or perception.
- **Environmental** - Powers creating hazardous conditions for the user or those nearby.
- **Resource-Dependent** - Powers requiring specific environmental factors to function or remain stable.

Applicants also document employment impact, from complete inability to work during manifestation to full capacity with standard accommodations. Support services include specialized housing, containment equipment, medical monitoring, transportation, caregiver assistance, and employment adaptation.

Treatment options include sedation during active power periods, ongoing symptom management, and experimental treatment enrollment.

### Workplace Accommodations

The private-sector process mirrors disability accommodation law, adapted for metahuman concerns. Employees submit a confidential request to HR with their NSRA registration number and power classification, verified through a secure NSRA portal.

Limitation patterns are classified as consistent, cyclical, episodic, progressive, or fluctuating. Accommodations include modified schedules, telecommuting, specialized equipment, environmental modifications, containment facility access, flexible breaks, temporary reassignment during active periods, and safety protocols.

Employers evaluate requests based on business necessity and undue hardship, with the interactive process overseen by HR and, where necessary, a Metahuman Integration Officer (MIO).

### Risk Assessment and Monitoring

Both tracks incorporate structured risk assessment. CASP evaluates applicants' history of uncontrolled manifestations on a four-tier severity scale (none, minor, moderate, serious) and ongoing public safety risk. CASP beneficiaries consent to biannual power evaluations, home inspections, mandatory reporting of power changes, and National Metahuman Registry participation.

In workplace settings, safety considerations may require designated safe areas, emergency response protocols, co-worker notification and training, and modified evacuation plans.

### Confidentiality Protections

Accommodation information is treated as confidential medical data. Workplace disclosure is limited to supervisors needing to know about restrictions, safety personnel, government compliance investigators, and MIOs as required by federal law. Failure to disclose a relevant metahuman condition may result in disciplinary action under company policy and federal statute.

## History

The accommodation system developed as existing disability and social safety-net frameworks proved insufficient for superhuman-specific challenges. The Federal Metahuman Disclosure Act and Federal Metahuman Employment Act established the legal foundations, though their exact enactment dates are undocumented.

CASP appears modeled on the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) system, as suggested by its form designation (MH-SSI-401(c)). The workplace framework extended ADA protections to metahuman-specific needs, creating parallel compliance infrastructure accounting for containment requirements and public safety concerns absent from conventional disability law.

## Implications

By providing structured support pathways, the system reduces the likelihood that metahumans with difficult-to-manage abilities are driven to societal margins where they might pose greater risks or face criminal recruitment.

However, CASP's mandatory monitoring - home inspections, power evaluations, Registry participation - represents a significant civil liberties trade-off with no parallel in conventional disability programs.

In the workplace, the possibility that uncontrolled power manifestation could injure coworkers or require evacuation fundamentally changes the calculus of "reasonable accommodation." For individuals whose abilities impose cyclical incapacitation or require expensive containment, the accommodation system is often the primary mechanism for maintaining economic participation.

## Classification / Taxonomy

### Limitation Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Temporal | Powers fluctuate based on time cycles or external triggers (diurnal, lunar, seasonal, weather, emotional) |
| Control-Related | Inability to fully regulate power activation or suppression |
| Physiological | Physical changes incompatible with standard human environments or functioning |
| Cognitive | Mental alterations affecting decision-making or perception |
| Environmental | Powers that create hazardous conditions for the user or nearby individuals |
| Resource-Dependent | Powers requiring specific environmental factors to function or remain stable |

### Employment Impact Tiers

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Complete Inability | Cannot work during manifestation periods |
| Partial Capacity | Can work with significant accommodations |
| Full Capacity | Can work with standard accommodations |
| Fluctuating Capacity | Requires flexible scheduling due to variable ability expression |

### Limitation Patterns (Workplace)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Consistent | Limitation is always present |
| Cyclical | Follows a predictable recurring pattern |
| Episodic | Occurs unpredictably |
| Progressive | Worsens over time |
| Fluctuating | Varies in intensity without a fixed pattern |

### Public Safety Risk Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No Risk | No danger to the general public |
| Minimal Risk | Manageable with current accommodations |
| Moderate Risk | Requires enhanced monitoring |
| Significant Risk | Requires direct NSRA oversight |

- **Metahuman Healthcare** - The broader medical infrastructure for powered individuals; CASP covers medical monitoring and treatment.

## Trivia

- Lunar-cycle power fluctuations have their own checkbox on the CASP application, indicating lycanthropic or lunar-dependent conditions are common enough to warrant specific recognition.
- Workplace accommodation requests require an "NSRA Workplace Integration Certificate," a document with no equivalent in conventional disability processes.
- The workplace form references both ADA and MHA compliance, confirming metahuman accommodation law exists as a parallel track alongside traditional disability protections.
- Employers may require "co-worker notification/training" as a safety measure, raising confidentiality-versus-safety questions unique to metahuman employment law.
