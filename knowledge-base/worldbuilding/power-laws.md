## Overview

"Power Laws" is the informal umbrella term for the expanding body of American legislation, case law, and regulatory policy that governs metahuman abilities. Since the emergence of superhumans in the 1980s, the United States has developed a complex and evolving legal infrastructure to address the challenges posed by individuals who can manipulate weather, read minds, interface with digital systems, shapeshift, or wield other extraordinary capabilities. This legislative body touches virtually every domain of law -- criminal, civil, employment, environmental, aviation, digital privacy, and insurance -- and has generated its own specialized bar of attorneys, regulatory commissions, and enforcement mechanisms.

The legislation broadly falls into several categories: registration and licensing requirements (centered on the LUMA system), power-specific regulatory acts targeting abilities deemed uniquely dangerous or intrusive (telepathy, geometeorological engineering, digital interface, flight, shapeshifting), criminal law adaptations (RICO applications, the Davis framework for powers-as-weapons), and civil rights protections (anti-discrimination statutes, privacy rights). The framework is administered primarily by the NSRA, though individual acts may establish their own specialized regulatory bodies.

The power laws remain a subject of significant public debate. Critics range from civil libertarians who view the regulatory apparatus as government overreach to commentators like William "Bill" Thompson who oppose specific mandates on ideological grounds. Meanwhile, an estimated 30,000 powered individuals live entirely outside the LUMA system in an underground network of safe houses, handlers, and shadow clinics, regarding the legal framework as fundamentally hostile to their existence.

## Mechanics

### Registration and Licensing

The foundation of the regulatory framework is the License to Utilize Metahuman Abilities (LUMA), established by the LUMA Act of 2013. LUMA is optional for personal use but mandatory for occupational power use, with an initial fee of $40 and biennial renewal at $20. Unlicensed power use carries a $250 base fine, while entities employing unlicensed metahumans face fines starting at $25,000. The juvenile version (JLUMA) requires annual renewal and carries its own set of restrictions.

An earlier attempt at mandatory registration -- the Superhuman Registration Act of 2008 -- was struck down by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision as violating the Fourth Amendment (privacy and search rights) and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments (due process). The LUMA system was designed as a more constitutionally permissible alternative, framing registration as a voluntary licensing scheme with practical incentives rather than a compulsory mandate.

### Power-Specific Legislation

Several acts target specific categories of metahuman ability that pose unique regulatory challenges:

- **Mind Privacy Act of 2005** -- Prohibits unauthorized telepathic access to another individual's thoughts, memories, or private mental information. Telepathy is defined as meeting three criteria: information acquisition without physical or digital means, communication of thoughts without conventional language, and independence from traditional sensory input. Violations constitute a misdemeanor punishable by fines of $1,000 to $10,000 and up to six months imprisonment, escalating to a felony with up to three years imprisonment for repeated or aggravated offenses. Exceptions exist for court-authorized law enforcement activity and imminent danger situations.

- **Morales Act of 2005** -- Named after Lana "Facsimile" Morales, a shapeshifting actress whose early career in Hollywood exposed a legal vacuum around metahuman impersonation. The act prohibits unauthorized use of shapeshifting abilities to replicate the appearance of public or private figures without explicit written consent. Penalties range from $5,000 to $50,000 for first offenses and up to $100,000 and three years imprisonment for repeat violations. Exceptions are carved out for authorized law enforcement operations and parody or satire under existing free speech protections. The NSRA oversees enforcement and maintains a database of registered consent agreements.

- **Superhuman Geometeorological Engineering Regulation Act of 2012** -- Regulates the use of metahuman abilities to manipulate weather patterns, atmospheric conditions, or geological structures. Establishes the Superhuman Geometeorological Engineering Commission (SGEC) under the NSRA as a dedicated regulatory body. Licensing requires a master's degree or higher in a relevant scientific field, completion of an SGEC-approved training program, demonstrated power mastery, and passing both a background check and psychological evaluation. Activities rated 5 or higher on the Superhuman Geometeorological Intervention Scale (SGIS, which runs from 1 to 10) are prohibited without explicit SGEC approval. Military or hostile use is strictly forbidden. Penalties include fines up to $1,000,000 per offense, license revocation with a five-year reapplication ban, and up to 20 years imprisonment for willful misconduct.

- **LUMA Flight Modification Act of 2014** -- Requires flight-capable metahumans to obtain a Flight Certification as an addendum to their LUMA. Applicants must demonstrate safe takeoff, navigation, and landing, as well as understanding of air traffic control communications and flight regulations. Juveniles are restricted to a maximum altitude of 30 feet above the nearest surface and a flight curfew between 8 PM and 8 AM. The NSRA collaborates with the Federal Aviation Administration to integrate flight-capable metahumans into the National Airspace System. Uncertified flight in restricted zones is a misdemeanor carrying fines of $2,000 to $30,000, escalating to criminal charges with up to three years imprisonment for severe violations.

- **Digital Interface Regulatory Framework Act of 2014 (DIRFA)** -- Establishes federal guidelines for metahuman abilities that interact with electronic systems, digital data, or telecommunications infrastructure. The act creates a certification program for Digital Interface Specialists administered by the NSRA, including background checks, technical proficiency examinations, and continuing education requirements. Unauthorized use of digital interface abilities to access protected systems is punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act with enhanced sentencing -- minimum sentences increase by 50% when such abilities are employed. Authorized access requires a valid court order, written consent from the system owner, federal law enforcement supervision, contracted security testing agreements, or emergency situations involving imminent threat to life.

- **Telepathic Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2015** -- Prohibits employers from making adverse employment decisions based on an individual's actual or perceived telepathic abilities, including hiring, firing, promotion, and compensation. Employers cannot require telepathic screening or use telepathic ability as a criterion for assessing job performance. Exceptions apply where telepathic abilities constitute a bona fide occupational qualification. Enforcement falls under the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, with fines up to $50,000 for first offenses and $100,000 for subsequent violations, plus potential compensatory damages.

### Criminal Law Adaptations

The emergence of powered crime has required significant adaptation of existing criminal law frameworks:

- ***United States v. Davis* (2005)** -- The landmark case that established the legal framework for classifying superhuman abilities as weapons when used in furtherance of a crime. The ruling created the legal term "Felony-Enabled Superhuman Operatives" (FESO) and held that operating under a nom-de-crime while committing felonies with powers constitutes a specific criminal category. Crucially, the decision did not authorize detention of non-criminal superhumans, limiting the weapons classification strictly to criminal contexts. The Davis framework is not automatic; prosecution must demonstrate that a power was actively used in furtherance of a crime, creating significant opportunities for defense attorneys to challenge enhanced charges.

- **RICO Adaptations** -- The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act has evolved substantially to address powered criminal enterprises. Traditional evidence-gathering methods -- financial records, communication intercepts -- are frequently unreliable when technopathic abilities can compromise digital records and enhanced-strength individuals can transport cash outside banking systems. Prosecutors have developed new frameworks centered on physical evidence patterns: power signatures at crime scenes, insurance claim analysis, specialized equipment purchases, and distinctive property damage patterns. LUMA records have become a particularly valuable investigative tool, as registration histories, payment patterns for members' fees, and renewal data help establish organizational structures and patterns of coordinated activity. The conviction of the "Steel Circuit" criminal enterprise exemplified these new prosecutorial methods, relying on insurance claim patterns showing distinctive enhanced-strength forced entry signatures across five states.

- **Powered Criminal Defense** -- A specialized defense bar has emerged to address the unique challenges of representing powered defendants. Key issues include jury selection (identifying anti-power bias during voir dire), the separation of LUMA compliance violations from underlying criminal charges, evidence integrity when powers affect crime scenes (particularly temporal manipulation), and expert testimony on power control development and the Bracing Effect to contextualize incidents. The intersection of traditional organized crime law with power-specific regulations has created novel legal questions, particularly in RICO cases involving multiple powered defendants whose abilities may interact.

### Additional Case Law

- ***State of New York v. Sentry Insurance* (2007)** -- A 5-4 Supreme Court decision prohibiting insurance companies from charging higher premiums based solely on superhuman status, citing the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
- ***Riley v. California* (2015)** -- Established that warrantless search and seizure of a superhuman's personal data is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.
- ***United States v. Gibson* (2017)** -- Addressed crimes committed using an "irresistible request" ability. The court ruled that mind-controlled accomplices should receive leniency, while Gibson received multiple life sentences and was imprisoned in Daedalus Correctional Facility.

## History

The legal framework governing metahuman abilities developed incrementally in response to the growing superhuman population and a series of high-profile incidents that exposed gaps in existing law.

The earliest metahumans appeared in 1982 as Genesis Births, and the first U.S. activation event was recorded in 1986. Through the 1990s, legal responses were largely reactive and ad hoc, with the government establishing the National Superhuman Registration Database in the mid-1990s and implementing the Pivot Protocols in 1997. The Superhuman Study and Response Division (SSRD) was formed in 2000, later absorbed into the NSRA when it was established in 2002.

The mid-2000s marked the beginning of comprehensive power-specific legislation. The Mind Privacy Act and Morales Act, both enacted in 2005, were among the first statutes to regulate specific categories of metahuman ability. The same year, *United States v. Davis* provided the foundational criminal law framework. The failed Superhuman Registration Act of 2008 -- struck down as unconstitutional -- demonstrated the limits of the government's regulatory reach and led to the more carefully crafted LUMA Act of 2013.

The Stewart presidency (2012-2020) was a period of significant legislative activity. The Geometeorological Engineering Regulation Act (2012), the LUMA Act (2013), the Flight Modification Act (2014), DIRFA (2014), the Telepathic Employment Non-Discrimination Act (2015), and the Digital Privacy Act (2015) were all enacted during this period. Stewart, a Republican who campaigned on superhuman security in the wake of the Tesla Incident, pursued a regulatory approach that balanced business-friendly libertarian principles with public safety mandates.

The Rodriguez presidency (2020-present) has continued to expand the framework with a more progressive orientation, notably passing the Superhuman Healthcare Act of 2021 to prevent healthcare discrimination against metahumans.

Throughout this period, the practical realities of enforcement have remained contested. An estimated 30,000 powered individuals live outside the LUMA system entirely, sustained by an underground network of handlers, safe houses, shadow clinics, encrypted communications channels, and power control trainers. This underground community includes individuals whose immigration status makes registration dangerous, those whose power classifications would result in institutionalization, and those who simply reject the premise that their abilities should be subject to government oversight.

## Implications

The power laws have reshaped American society in ways both visible and subtle. For the approximately 500,000 metahumans in the United States, the regulatory framework defines the boundaries of legal power use, from the workplace to public spaces to digital systems. Over two-thirds of metahumans avoid the hero-villain dynamic entirely, using their abilities in conventional employment -- but even this requires LUMA compliance.

The laws have generated entirely new professional fields. Specialized attorneys like Jennifer Martinez have built practices around powered criminal defense, teaching courses in powers legislation at law schools and developing novel legal strategies for challenges that have no precedent in conventional law. Insurance investigation has been transformed, with companies like UltraShield maintaining detailed databases of power-related claims that serve both commercial and law enforcement purposes.

The entertainment industry has been directly shaped by the Morales Act, which arose from the exploitation of shapeshifter Lana Morales in early 2000s Hollywood. Studios initially sought to use her ability to replicate celebrity likenesses at a fraction of the cost of hiring actual stars. The legislation established clear boundaries around impersonation but also, paradoxically, narrowed the range of roles available to shapeshifting performers by making their power -- rather than their talent -- the central concern of every contract negotiation.

The Geometeorological Engineering Regulation Act carries some of the most stringent requirements in the framework, reflecting the catastrophic potential of weather and geological manipulation. The requirement for a graduate degree in a relevant scientific field effectively limits licensed geometeorological engineering to a small number of qualified individuals.

For law enforcement, the power laws have created both tools and challenges. LUMA records provide invaluable investigative data, but the complexity of powered evidence -- from crime scenes affected by temporal manipulation to digital records compromised by technopathic interference -- has required fundamental rethinking of evidentiary standards and chain-of-custody procedures.

The underground community of unregistered metahumans represents the framework's most visible failure point. Advocates within this community argue that the system treats powered individuals as threats first and people second, while supporters of the regulatory regime contend that public safety demands accountability for abilities that can cause mass harm.
