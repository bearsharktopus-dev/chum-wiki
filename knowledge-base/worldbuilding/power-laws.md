## Overview

"Power Laws" is the informal umbrella term for the body of American legislation, case law, and regulatory policy governing metahuman abilities. Since superhumans emerged in the 1980s, the U.S. has developed a complex legal infrastructure spanning criminal, civil, employment, environmental, aviation, digital privacy, and insurance law, generating its own specialized bar of attorneys, regulatory commissions, and enforcement mechanisms.

The legislation falls into several categories: registration and licensing (the LUMA system), power-specific acts targeting abilities deemed uniquely dangerous or intrusive, criminal law adaptations (RICO applications, the Davis framework), and civil rights protections. The framework is administered primarily by the NSRA, though individual acts may establish their own regulatory bodies.

The power laws remain contested. Critics range from civil libertarians to commentators like William "Bill" Thompson, while an estimated 30,000 powered individuals live entirely outside the LUMA system in an underground network of safe houses, handlers, and shadow clinics.

## Mechanics

### Registration and Licensing

The foundation of the regulatory framework is the License to Utilize Metahuman Abilities (LUMA), established by the LUMA Act of 2013. LUMA is optional for personal use but mandatory for occupational power use, with an initial fee of $40 and biennial renewal at $20. Unlicensed power use carries a $250 base fine, while entities employing unlicensed metahumans face fines starting at $25,000. The juvenile version (JLUMA) requires annual renewal and carries its own set of restrictions.

An earlier attempt at mandatory registration - the Superhuman Registration Act of 2008 - was struck down by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision as violating the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. LUMA was designed as a constitutionally permissible alternative, framing registration as voluntary licensing with practical incentives rather than a compulsory mandate.

### Power-Specific Legislation

Several acts target specific categories of metahuman ability that pose unique regulatory challenges:

- **Mind Privacy Act of 2005** - Prohibits unauthorized telepathic access to another individual's thoughts, memories, or private mental information. Telepathy is defined as meeting three criteria: information acquisition without physical or digital means, communication of thoughts without conventional language, and independence from traditional sensory input. Violations constitute a misdemeanor punishable by fines of $1,000 to $10,000 and up to six months imprisonment, escalating to a felony with up to three years imprisonment for repeated or aggravated offenses. Exceptions exist for court-authorized law enforcement activity and imminent danger situations.

- **Morales Act of 2005** - Named after Lana "Facsimile" Morales, a shapeshifting actress whose early career in Hollywood exposed a legal vacuum around metahuman impersonation. The act prohibits unauthorized use of shapeshifting abilities to replicate the appearance of public or private figures without explicit written consent. Penalties range from $5,000 to $50,000 for first offenses and up to $100,000 and three years imprisonment for repeat violations. Exceptions are carved out for authorized law enforcement operations and parody or satire under existing free speech protections. The NSRA oversees enforcement and maintains a database of registered consent agreements.

- **Superhuman Geometeorological Engineering Regulation Act of 2012** - Regulates the use of metahuman abilities to manipulate weather patterns, atmospheric conditions, or geological structures. Establishes the Superhuman Geometeorological Engineering Commission (SGEC) under the NSRA as a dedicated regulatory body. Licensing requires a master's degree or higher in a relevant scientific field, completion of an SGEC-approved training program, demonstrated power mastery, and passing both a background check and psychological evaluation. Activities rated 5 or higher on the Superhuman Geometeorological Intervention Scale (SGIS, which runs from 1 to 10) are prohibited without explicit SGEC approval. Military or hostile use is strictly forbidden. Penalties include fines up to $1,000,000 per offense, license revocation with a five-year reapplication ban, and up to 20 years imprisonment for willful misconduct.

- **LUMA Flight Modification Act of 2014** - Requires flight-capable metahumans to obtain a Flight Certification as an addendum to their LUMA. Applicants must demonstrate safe takeoff, navigation, and landing, as well as understanding of air traffic control communications and flight regulations. Juveniles are restricted to a maximum altitude of 30 feet above the nearest surface and a flight curfew between 8 PM and 8 AM. The NSRA collaborates with the Federal Aviation Administration to integrate flight-capable metahumans into the National Airspace System. Uncertified flight in restricted zones is a misdemeanor carrying fines of $2,000 to $30,000, escalating to criminal charges with up to three years imprisonment for severe violations.

- **Digital Interface Regulatory Framework Act of 2014 (DIRFA)** - Establishes federal guidelines for metahuman abilities that interact with electronic systems, digital data, or telecommunications infrastructure. The act creates a certification program for Digital Interface Specialists administered by the NSRA, including background checks, technical proficiency examinations, and continuing education requirements. Unauthorized use of digital interface abilities to access protected systems is punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act with enhanced sentencing - minimum sentences increase by 50% when such abilities are employed. Authorized access requires a valid court order, written consent from the system owner, federal law enforcement supervision, contracted security testing agreements, or emergency situations involving imminent threat to life.

- **Telepathic Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2015** - Prohibits employers from making adverse employment decisions based on an individual's actual or perceived telepathic abilities, including hiring, firing, promotion, and compensation. Employers cannot require telepathic screening or use telepathic ability as a criterion for assessing job performance. Exceptions apply where telepathic abilities constitute a bona fide occupational qualification. Enforcement falls under the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, with fines up to $50,000 for first offenses and $100,000 for subsequent violations, plus potential compensatory damages.

### Criminal Law Adaptations

The emergence of powered crime has required significant adaptation of existing criminal law frameworks:

- ***United States v. Davis* (2005)** - The landmark case that established the legal framework for classifying superhuman abilities as weapons when used in furtherance of a crime. The ruling created the legal term "Felony-Enabled Superhuman Operatives" (FESO) and held that operating under a nom-de-crime while committing felonies with powers constitutes a specific criminal category. Crucially, the decision did not authorize detention of non-criminal superhumans, limiting the weapons classification strictly to criminal contexts. The Davis framework is not automatic; prosecution must demonstrate that a power was actively used in furtherance of a crime, creating significant opportunities for defense attorneys to challenge enhanced charges.

- **RICO Adaptations** - The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act has evolved substantially to address powered criminal enterprises. Traditional evidence-gathering methods - financial records, communication intercepts - are frequently unreliable when technopathic abilities can compromise digital records and enhanced-strength individuals can transport cash outside banking systems. Prosecutors have developed new frameworks centered on physical evidence patterns: power signatures at crime scenes, insurance claim analysis, specialized equipment purchases, and distinctive property damage patterns. LUMA records have become a particularly valuable investigative tool, as registration histories, payment patterns for members' fees, and renewal data help establish organizational structures and patterns of coordinated activity. The conviction of the "Steel Circuit" criminal enterprise exemplified these new prosecutorial methods, relying on insurance claim patterns showing distinctive enhanced-strength forced entry signatures across five states.

- **Powered Criminal Defense** - A specialized defense bar has emerged to address the unique challenges of representing powered defendants. Key issues include jury selection (identifying anti-power bias during voir dire), the separation of LUMA compliance violations from underlying criminal charges, evidence integrity when powers affect crime scenes (particularly temporal manipulation), and expert testimony on power control development and the Bracing Effect to contextualize incidents. The intersection of traditional organized crime law with power-specific regulations has created novel legal questions, particularly in RICO cases involving multiple powered defendants whose abilities may interact.

### Additional Case Law

- ***State of New York v. Sentry Insurance* (2007)** - A 5-4 Supreme Court decision prohibiting insurance companies from charging higher premiums based solely on superhuman status, citing the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
- ***Riley v. California* (2015)** - Established that warrantless search and seizure of a superhuman's personal data is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.
- ***United States v. Gibson* (2017)** - Addressed crimes committed using an "irresistible request" ability. The court ruled that mind-controlled accomplices should receive leniency, while Gibson received multiple life sentences and was imprisoned in Daedalus Correctional Facility.

## History

The earliest metahumans appeared in 1982 as Genesis Births, with the first U.S. activation event in 1986. Through the 1990s, responses were ad hoc: the National Superhuman Registration Database (mid-1990s), the Pivot Protocols (1997), and the SSRD (2000, later absorbed into the NSRA in 2002).

Comprehensive legislation began in the mid-2000s with the Mind Privacy Act, Morales Act, and *United States v. Davis* (all 2005). The failed SRA of 2008 demonstrated the limits of mandatory registration, leading to the more carefully crafted LUMA Act of 2013.

The Stewart presidency (2012-2020) produced the bulk of the current framework: the Geometeorological Engineering Regulation Act (2012), LUMA Act (2013), Flight Modification Act (2014), DIRFA (2014), Telepathic Employment Non-Discrimination Act (2015), and Digital Privacy Act (2015). Stewart balanced business-friendly principles with public safety mandates in the wake of the Tesla Incident.

The Rodriguez presidency (2020-present) expanded the framework with a more progressive orientation, notably the Superhuman Healthcare Act of 2021.

Despite this apparatus, an estimated 30,000 powered individuals live outside the LUMA system, sustained by handlers, safe houses, shadow clinics, encrypted communications, and power control trainers. This community includes those whose immigration status makes registration dangerous, those facing institutionalization under their power classification, and those who reject government oversight of their abilities.

## Implications

For the approximately 500,000 metahumans in the United States, the power laws define the boundaries of legal power use across all domains of life. Over two-thirds avoid the hero-villain dynamic entirely, using their abilities in conventional employment - but even this requires LUMA compliance.

The laws have generated new professional fields. Specialized attorneys like Jennifer Martinez have built practices around powered criminal defense, while companies like UltraShield maintain claim databases that serve both commercial and law enforcement purposes.

The entertainment industry was directly shaped by the Morales Act. The legislation established clear boundaries around impersonation but also narrowed the range of roles available to shapeshifting performers by making their power - rather than their talent - the central concern of every contract negotiation.

For law enforcement, LUMA records provide invaluable investigative data, but powered evidence - from temporally affected crime scenes to technopathically compromised digital records - has required fundamental rethinking of evidentiary standards and chain-of-custody procedures.

The underground community represents the framework's most visible failure point. Advocates argue the system treats powered individuals as threats first and people second, while supporters contend that public safety demands accountability for abilities that can cause mass harm.
