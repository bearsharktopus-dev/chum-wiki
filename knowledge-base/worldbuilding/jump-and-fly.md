## Overview

Jump and Fly are two related synthetic substances that emerged in the northeastern United States in spring 2024. Both share a core compound - Anomalous Compound Alpha-Delta - but differ in delivery, duration, and risk. Jump, an oral capsule, grants temporary superhuman abilities lasting approximately three hours. Fly, an injectable liquid, grants semi-permanent powers that weaken over time. Together, they allow ordinary humans to acquire superpowers outside the PERKS and LUMA frameworks.

Distributed by the anarchist collective Rogue Wave through decentralized networks, the substances spread rapidly through Philadelphia, New York City, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. By mid-2025, nationwide Jump users numbered 380,000 to 430,000, with approximately 4.2% of Philadelphia's population having used Jump at least once. Users span the socioeconomic spectrum, from warehouse workers to financial sector employees.

The DEA placed both substances on Schedule I effective December 1, 2024, and Congress passed the Metahuman Substance Control Act in February 2025 to expand enforcement authority.

## Mechanics

### Jump

Jump is a small green capsule containing a powder that grants temporary superhuman abilities for approximately three hours. The specific power is batch-determined, though per-user variations occur based on genetic markers. Over 600 distinct power manifestations have been documented.

Jump is stackable: multiple pills grant multiple powers predictably, though incompatible combinations may produce unusual side effects. The drug produces no euphoria or altered consciousness; side effects include disorientation and physiological stress.

Jump does not create physical dependency through traditional pathways, but researchers have noted significant psychological dependency, as users who have experienced superhuman capabilities often find ordinary limitations difficult to accept.

### Fly

Fly is an injectable, opaque, brightly colored liquid (color varies by formulation) that grants semi-permanent superhuman abilities. Powers weaken over time; whether they are functionally permanent or require boosters remains under investigation.

Repeated same-strain injections amplify existing powers. Mixing different strains produces dangerous autodestructive secondary or tertiary powers. Fly also produces powerful psychoactive effects lasting one to two hours upon injection.

Fly carries significantly greater medical risks: jaundice, anemia, elevated bilirubin levels, hemolysis, and metabolic alkalosis. Users develop distinctively orange-colored blood that dries yellow. Between January and October 2024, at least 126 deaths were attributed to Fly use, compared to 87 for Jump.

### Chemical Composition

Both substances contain Anomalous Compound Alpha-Delta alongside variable pharmacological elements determining specific effects. Complete reverse engineering has not been achieved due to the compound's instability during laboratory analysis. Alpha-Delta's consistent presence across all variants provides the primary identification marker for enforcement.

### Hypothesized Mechanisms of Action

Several hypotheses exist:

- **Genetic modification** - The substances may alter DNA to unlock superhuman abilities.
- **Biochemical interaction** - The drugs may target specific neural or muscular pathways.
- **Exotic matter** - Unknown compounds may temporarily or permanently alter human physiology.
- **Activation potential trigger** - The substances may function as a placebo for individuals with latent activation potential, convincing the body of near-death circumstances sufficient to trigger manifestation.

No definitive mechanism has been confirmed.

## History

The NSRA issued an all-points bulletin on April 18, 2024, with the DEA publishing a Notice of Intent on April 22 and a temporary Schedule I placement on May 22. After receiving 163 public comments (142 supporting permanent scheduling), the DEA issued a Final Rule effective December 1, 2024.

Street prices stabilized at $850 to $1,200 per dose. Rogue Wave claimed distribution responsibility through manifestos and public stunts, operating through decentralized networks without clear hierarchy. Law enforcement identified the member known as Snake Oil as the suspected primary producer, noting manufacturing required sophisticated knowledge of biochemistry and metahuman physiology.

## Implications

### Public Safety and Law Enforcement

Emergency rooms report approximately 350 Jump-related incidents per month, encompassing unpredictable power manifestations and ability-testing injuries. The NSRA has directed agents to prioritize distribution network investigation and employ non-lethal containment when engaging suspected users.

### Socioeconomic Impact

Surveys document usage among warehouse workers (7%), emergency medical personnel (5.8%), financial sector employees (4.3%), graduate students (3.7%), and construction workers (2.9%). Many are "functional" users with stable employment who view Jump as a performance enhancer. Underground "Jump parties" have emerged where users pool resources for multiple doses and share resulting abilities.

### Insurance and Commerce

The insurance industry created specialized "metahuman incident" clauses, with premiums rising 13% nationwide. Meritron Laboratories developed a saliva test detecting Jump metabolites up to 24 hours post-use, now deployed in sensitive workplaces and transportation hubs.

### Regulatory and Ethical Dimensions

The drugs have ignited debate over democratization of superhuman abilities. Some ethicists view temporary powers as inevitable technological progression; others cite severe health risks and national security implications. The government has favored enforcement over harm reduction, though usage scale challenges prohibition-based approaches.

### National Security

The ability to grant superhuman capabilities to any individual presents unprecedented risks to critical infrastructure and governmental institutions, a central factor in both the DEA's scheduling decision and expanded NSRA enforcement authority.

## Trivia

- The street price of a single Jump dose ($850-$1,200) is comparable to the price of a used smartphone, a comparison frequently cited in media coverage.
- Of 163 public comments during the DEA scheduling process, only 9 opposed permanent scheduling, citing individual liberty concerns.
