## Overview

Jump and Fly are two related synthetic substances that emerged on the streets of the northeastern United States in spring 2024. Both drugs share a core chemical compound -- Anomalous Compound Alpha-Delta -- but differ in their delivery method, duration of effect, and risk profile. Jump, an oral capsule, grants temporary superhuman abilities lasting approximately three hours. Fly, an injectable liquid, grants semi-permanent powers that weaken over time but persist far longer than Jump's effects. Together, they represent an unprecedented disruption to metahuman regulation, as they allow ordinary humans to acquire superpowers outside the established PERKS and LUMA frameworks.

The substances spread rapidly through major metropolitan areas including Philadelphia, New York City, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., distributed by the anarchist collective known as Rogue Wave through decentralized networks. By mid-2025, nationwide usage estimates placed the number of Jump users between 380,000 and 430,000, with approximately 4.2% of Philadelphia's population -- roughly 65,000 people -- having used Jump at least once. The drugs attracted users from across the socioeconomic spectrum, from warehouse workers seeking a competitive edge to financial sector employees and graduate students.

The emergence of Jump and Fly prompted a sweeping governmental response. The DEA placed both substances on Schedule I effective December 1, 2024, the NSRA issued urgent field directives prioritizing investigation and containment, and Congress passed the Metahuman Substance Control Act in February 2025 to expand enforcement authority.

## Mechanics

### Jump

Jump takes the form of a small green capsule containing a powder. When ingested, it grants temporary superhuman abilities for approximately three hours before completely metabolizing out of the user's system. The specific power granted is determined by the batch rather than the user, though slight per-user variations occur based on individual genetic markers. Over 600 distinct power manifestations have been documented from Jump samples, ranging from enhanced strength to telekinesis to heightened senses.

A notable property of Jump is its stackability: taking multiple pills simultaneously grants multiple powers in a predictable fashion, though incompatible combinations may produce unusual side effects. The drug does not produce euphoria or altered consciousness in the traditional sense. Side effects include mild to severe disorientation and physiological stress following usage.

Jump does not create physical dependency through traditional addiction pathways. However, researchers have noted a significant psychological dependency component, as users who have experienced superhuman capabilities often find ordinary human limitations difficult to accept.

### Fly

Fly is an injectable substance derived from the same core compound as Jump. It is administered via syringe and typically appears as an opaque, brightly colored liquid, with color varying by formulation. Unlike Jump, Fly grants semi-permanent superhuman abilities. These powers appear to weaken over time, though whether they are functionally permanent or require booster injections remains under investigation.

Repeated injections of the same strain of Fly amplify existing powers. However, mixing two different strains produces dangerously unpredictable results, typically manifesting as spontaneous autodestructive secondary or tertiary powers unrelated to the originally injected abilities. Fly also produces powerful psychoactive effects lasting one to two hours upon initial injection.

Fly carries significantly greater medical risks than Jump. Documented complications include jaundice, anemia, altered blood chemistry (particularly elevated bilirubin levels and blood pH), and signs of hemolysis and metabolic alkalosis. Users develop distinctively orange-colored blood, and blood stains from Fly users dry yellow. Between January and October 2024 alone, at least 126 deaths were attributed to Fly use, compared to 87 for Jump.

### Chemical Composition

Both substances contain a core compound designated Anomalous Compound Alpha-Delta, alongside variable pharmacological elements that determine specific physiological effects. Complete reverse engineering has not been achieved due to the compound's novel chemical structure and apparent instability during laboratory analysis. The consistent presence of Compound Alpha-Delta and its derivatives across all variants provides the primary identification marker for enforcement purposes.

### Hypothesized Mechanisms of Action

Several hypotheses have been proposed for how Jump and Fly operate:

- **Genetic modification** -- The substances may alter DNA to unlock or insert superhuman abilities.
- **Biochemical interaction** -- The drugs may target specific neural or muscular pathways to enhance or grant abilities.
- **Exotic matter** -- The drugs may contain unknown compounds that temporarily or permanently alter human physiology.
- **Activation potential trigger** -- The substances may function as a placebo distributed only to individuals with latent activation potential, convincing the body of near-death circumstances sufficient to trigger power manifestation.

No definitive mechanism of action has been confirmed.

## History

Jump and Fly first appeared on the streets of the northeastern United States in spring 2024, concentrated in Philadelphia and spreading rapidly to New York City, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. The NSRA issued an all-points bulletin on April 18, 2024, alerting field agents to the new substances and establishing initial response protocols.

The DEA moved swiftly on the regulatory front. A Notice of Intent to temporarily schedule the substances was published on April 22, 2024, followed by a temporary Schedule I placement order on May 22, 2024. After a formal scientific and medical evaluation period -- during which 163 public comments were received, with 142 supporting permanent scheduling -- the DEA issued a Final Rule permanently placing both Jump and Fly in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, effective December 1, 2024.

By mid-2025, Jump had been present on American streets for over a year. Street prices stabilized at $850 to $1,200 per dose. The drug's distribution was attributed to the anarchist collective Rogue Wave, which claimed responsibility through sporadic manifestos and public stunts. Unlike traditional drug cartels, Rogue Wave operated through decentralized networks without clear hierarchy or territory disputes. Law enforcement identified the Rogue Wave member known as Snake Oil as the suspected primary producer of the compound, noting that manufacturing appeared to require sophisticated knowledge of biochemistry and metahuman physiology.

Congress responded to the growing crisis by passing the Metahuman Substance Control Act in February 2025, establishing enhanced penalties and expanding NSRA authority to investigate Jump-related activity.

## Implications

### Public Safety and Law Enforcement

Jump and Fly pose extraordinary challenges to law enforcement and public safety. Emergency rooms across major cities report approximately 350 Jump-related incidents per month, encompassing unpredictable power manifestations and injuries sustained during ability testing. The NSRA has directed field agents to prioritize investigation of distribution networks, employ non-lethal containment measures when engaging suspected users, and coordinate with local Registered Superhuman Entities for containment support.

### Socioeconomic Impact

Jump usage crosses conventional socioeconomic boundaries. Surveys have documented usage among warehouse and logistics workers (7%), emergency medical personnel (5.8%), financial sector employees (4.3%), graduate students (3.7%), and construction workers (2.9%). Many users are "functional" -- individuals with stable employment and no criminal history who view Jump as a performance enhancer rather than a recreational drug. Underground "Jump parties" have emerged in metropolitan areas, where users pool resources to purchase multiple doses and share different abilities.

### Insurance and Commerce

The insurance industry has responded by creating specialized "metahuman incident" clauses, with premiums rising 13% nationwide. Pharmaceutical company Meritron Laboratories developed a saliva test capable of detecting Jump metabolites up to 24 hours after use, now deployed in sensitive workplaces and transportation hubs.

### Regulatory and Ethical Dimensions

Jump and Fly have ignited debate over the democratization of superhuman abilities. Some ethicists argue that temporary powers accessible to ordinary citizens represent an inevitable technological progression, while others point to the severe health risks and national security implications. The government has thus far favored enforcement over harm reduction, though the sheer scale of usage presents ongoing challenges to prohibition-based approaches.

### National Security

The ability to temporarily or permanently grant superhuman capabilities to any individual presents unprecedented risks to critical infrastructure, governmental institutions, and civilian populations. This concern was a central factor in both the DEA's scheduling decision and the expanded NSRA enforcement authority granted under the Metahuman Substance Control Act.
