## Overview

The emergence of superhumans beginning with the Genesis Births of the late 1970s and early 1980s fundamentally altered the role of firearms in American society. Once a cornerstone of personal safety doctrine, guns underwent a steep decline in both ownership and perceived utility as a series of high-profile incidents demonstrated their ineffectiveness against superpowered individuals.

Behind the cultural shift lay a classified government strategy: the deliberate, long-term reduction of firearms prevalence to prevent the development of gun-resistant powers in the metahuman population.

## Mechanics

### Firearms vs. Superhumans: Effectiveness

A 2012 NSRA study found that superhumans prevail in over 60% of recorded one-on-one confrontations with armed assailants, even without combat training (though survivorship bias is a noted limitation). Many metahumans possess enhanced durability, reflexes, or sensory abilities that render small arms fire ineffective, while others wield powers that vastly outclass firearms in destructive potential and versatility.

### The Activation Feedback Problem

Gunshot wounds can serve as the triggering trauma for an Activation Event, and powers manifested this way have a high likelihood of conferring resistance or immunity to the activating stimulus - in this case, ballistic projectiles. This creates a dangerous feedback loop: the more firearms are used against metahumans, the more gun-resistant superhumans the population produces. The government identified this dynamic as a core strategic concern, reasoning that widespread firearms-immune metahumans would eliminate one of the state's remaining tools for neutralizing superhuman threats.

### Alternative Containment Methods

Alternative approaches developed for engaging enhanced-durability individuals include:

- **De-escalation and negotiation** - Prioritized as the first-line response in DOJ guidelines.
- **Riot control agents** - Tear gas, pepper spray, and similar chemical agents.
- **Sensory overload tactics** - Strobe lights, flashbang grenades, Amplified Directed Acoustic Devices (ADADs), malodorants, and asphyxiants.
- **Physical containment** - Nets, rapid-hardening foam agents, and reinforced restraints.
- **Multi-agency coordination** - Unified command structures, shared intelligence, and joint response protocols.

## History

### 1970s-1980s: Initial Reaction

The 1977 Revolt at Cincinnati saw the NRA pivot from its traditional focus on hunting and marksmanship to hardline Second Amendment advocacy. This shift coincided with the Genesis Births and the first documented Activation Events. As reports of superhuman abilities grew more frequent throughout the 1980s, the NRA capitalized on public fear, arguing that the right to bear arms was more vital than ever. Gun sales surged in response, and the firearms lobby enjoyed a period of significant political influence.

### 1989: Cedar Mills Incident

A child undergoing an Activation Event in Cedar Mills, Iowa inadvertently generated a tornado that devastated the small town, causing tens of millions in property damage. The first major activation-related disaster highlighted destruction that no amount of personal firearms could prevent.

### 1994: New York City Bank Robbery

A child bystander with superhuman strength intervened in a bank robbery in New York City, crumpling the robbers' weapons into small balls. The widely broadcast footage became a watershed moment, demonstrating the futility of firearms against even a young, untrained metahuman.

### Mid-1990s: The Turning Point

Despite record gun sales (2.7 million FBI background checks in 1995 alone), public opinion was shifting rapidly. A 1995 Gallup poll found that 58% of Americans believed superhumans made guns less necessary for personal protection, up from 30% in 1985. The proportion who believed superhumans made guns more necessary collapsed from 41% to 19% over the same period.

### Late 1990s: Government Strategy

A classified DoD memorandum by Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen proposed a long-term strategy to gradually reduce firearms prevalence, motivated by the Activation Feedback Problem. The memo recommended stricter civilian regulation, buyback programs, and a shift toward less-lethal means. It was classified TOP SECRET//SCI//NOFORN with a declassification date of April 15, 2025.

### 2000s: Legislative and Institutional Response

The Pivot Protocols (1997) and the Superhuman Study and Response Division (2000) formalized the government's approach. Legislation such as the Mind Privacy Act, the Telekinetic Assault Act, and the Pyrogenetic Collateral Damage Act, along with cases like Justin v. United States (2006) and Horowitz v. Sullivan (2012), further eroded arguments for personal firearms against powers like telekinesis or invulnerability.

In 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft issued interim DOJ guidelines for responding to enhanced-durability individuals, establishing de-escalation as the primary objective, introducing sensory overload tactics, and mandating specialized training.

### 2008: The Grant Administration

President James Grant's election on a platform of superhuman rights and sensible regulation marked a further political shift. His successful repeal of the controversial Superhuman Registration Act was widely seen as a repudiation of the fear-based politics that had sustained the gun rights movement.

### 2015: The New Normal

By 2015, the estimated metahuman population in the United States had grown to approximately 450,000. Household gun ownership stood at 34%, NRA membership had declined by 45%, gun-related crime had fallen by 40% since the early 1990s, and 68% of Americans supported stricter gun control, with support highest among younger generations who had grown up in a world where superpowers were an accepted reality.

## Implications

### Strategic Paradox

Rather than arming law enforcement more heavily, policy shifted toward disarming society to preserve firearms as a last-resort tool. Gun control, in this context, functions as a national security strategy as much as a public safety measure.

### Law Enforcement Doctrine

Conventional officers are no longer expected to engage superhumans with firearms. Policy emphasizes de-escalation, containment, and coordination with metahuman responders or specialized NSRA units, aligning with the post-Tesla Incident doctrine that superhumans should manage each other.

### Cultural Transformation

A society that once defined personal liberty partly through gun ownership gradually came to view firearms as obsolete relics. The NRA's collapse illustrates how quickly entrenched institutions can lose relevance when their foundational assumptions are overturned.

## Related Concepts

- **PERKS Assessment** - Informs threat assessment and determines when conventional or unconventional force is authorized.
- **Activation Events** - Gunshot wounds are a documented trigger, with resulting powers often conferring resistance to the activating stimulus.
- **Tesla Incident** - The 2011 catastrophe that reinforced the doctrine of non-engagement by conventional forces.
- **NSRA (National Superhuman Response Agency)** - Conducted the 2012 study on superhuman vs. firearms confrontation outcomes.
- **Pivot Protocols** - The 1997 framework contributing to the de-emphasis of firearms in metahuman engagement.
- **Bracing Effect** - Contributes to many metahumans' resilience against ballistic impacts.
- **Enhanced Durability** - A common Gigant-category classification rendering metahumans resistant to conventional firearms.

## Trivia

- The classified DoD memo's declassification date of April 15, 2025 suggests the government anticipated the strategy would take approximately three decades to implement.
- FBI background checks for firearm purchases peaked at 2.7 million in 1995, the same year public opinion decisively turned against guns' necessity in a world of superhumans.
- The DOJ's 2002 interim guidelines for enhanced-durability individuals never mention firearms as a recommended tool.
