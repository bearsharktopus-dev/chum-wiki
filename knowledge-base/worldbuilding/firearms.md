## Overview

The emergence of superhumans beginning with the Genesis Births of the late 1970s and early 1980s fundamentally altered the role of firearms in American society. Once a cornerstone of personal safety doctrine and a powerful cultural symbol, guns underwent a steep decline in both ownership and perceived utility as the metahuman population grew and a series of high-profile incidents demonstrated their ineffectiveness against superpowered individuals.

By 2015, household gun ownership had fallen from approximately 45% in the early 1990s to 34%, gun-related crime had dropped nearly 40%, and public support for stricter gun control legislation had risen to 68%. The National Rifle Association, which had once leveraged fears of superhumans to drive gun sales, saw its membership decline by roughly 45% from its mid-1990s peak. Behind these cultural shifts lay a classified government strategy: the deliberate, long-term reduction of firearms prevalence to prevent the development of gun-resistant powers in the metahuman population.

The firearms question sits at the intersection of several major policy concerns in the superhuman age, including law enforcement doctrine, national defense strategy, the Activation Event phenomenon, and the broader social compact between ordinary citizens and metahumans.

## Mechanics

### Firearms vs. Superhumans: Effectiveness

A 2012 NSRA study found that in all recorded one-on-one confrontations, a superhuman prevails against a firearms-wielding assailant more than 60% of the time, even with no combat training. While the study acknowledges survivorship bias as a complicating factor, the finding underscored the diminishing tactical value of conventional firearms against the metahuman population.

Several factors contribute to this imbalance. Many metahumans possess enhanced durability, reflexes, or sensory abilities that render small arms fire ineffective or easily avoided. Others wield offensive powers -- telekinesis, energy projection, elemental manipulation -- that vastly outrange and outclass conventional firearms in both destructive potential and versatility.

### The Activation Feedback Problem

Perhaps the most strategically significant finding is that gunshot wounds can serve as the triggering trauma for an Activation Event. When a latent metahuman is shot, the extreme stress of the injury may activate their dormant abilities. Critically, powers developed through this mechanism have a high likelihood of manifesting as resistance or outright immunity to the stimulus that triggered them -- in this case, ballistic projectiles and conventional firearms.

This creates a dangerous feedback loop: the more firearms are used against the metahuman population, the more gun-resistant superhumans the population produces. The U.S. government identified this dynamic as a core strategic concern, reasoning that if firearms-immune metahumans became widespread, the state would lose one of its remaining reliable tools for neutralizing superhuman threats when absolutely necessary.

### Alternative Containment Methods

In response to the diminishing effectiveness of firearms, law enforcement and military agencies developed alternative approaches for engaging enhanced-durability individuals:

- **De-escalation and negotiation** -- Prioritized as the first-line response in DOJ guidelines.
- **Riot control agents** -- Tear gas, pepper spray, and similar chemical agents.
- **Sensory overload tactics** -- High-intensity strobe lights, flashbang grenades, Amplified Directed Acoustic Devices (ADADs), and malodorants or asphyxiants.
- **Physical containment** -- Nets, rapid-hardening foam agents, and reinforced restraints.
- **Multi-agency coordination** -- Unified command structures, shared intelligence, and joint tactical response protocols.

## History

### 1970s-1980s: Initial Reaction

The 1977 Revolt at Cincinnati saw the NRA pivot from its traditional focus on hunting and marksmanship to hardline Second Amendment advocacy. This shift coincided with the Genesis Births and the first documented Activation Events. As reports of superhuman abilities grew more frequent throughout the 1980s, the NRA capitalized on public fear, arguing that the right to bear arms was more vital than ever. Gun sales surged in response, and the firearms lobby enjoyed a period of significant political influence.

### 1989: Cedar Mills Incident

A child undergoing an Activation Event in Cedar Mills, Iowa inadvertently generated a tornado that devastated the small town, causing tens of millions of dollars in property damage. The incident was the first major activation-related disaster and highlighted the scale of destruction that uncontrolled superhuman abilities could unleash -- destruction that no amount of personal firearms could prevent or mitigate.

### 1994: New York City Bank Robbery

A child bystander with superhuman strength intervened in a bank robbery in New York City, effortlessly disarming the robbers by crumpling their weapons into small balls. The widely broadcast footage became a watershed moment in public perception, vividly demonstrating the futility of firearms against even a young, untrained metahuman.

### Mid-1990s: The Turning Point

Despite record gun sales (2.7 million FBI background checks in 1995 alone), public opinion was shifting rapidly. A 1995 Gallup poll found that 58% of Americans believed superhumans made guns less necessary for personal protection, up from 30% in 1985. The proportion who believed superhumans made guns more necessary collapsed from 41% to 19% over the same period.

### Late 1990s: Government Strategy

A classified Department of Defense memorandum, authored by Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, proposed a long-term strategy to gradually reduce firearms prevalence in American society. The strategy was motivated by the discovery that shooting superhumans risked triggering Activation Events that produced gun-immune metahumans. The memo recommended stricter civilian firearm regulation, buyback programs, and a shift in law enforcement and military tactics toward less-lethal means. The document was classified TOP SECRET//SCI//NOFORN with a declassification date of April 15, 2025.

### 2000s: Legislative and Institutional Response

The Pivot Protocols (1997) and the establishment of the Superhuman Study and Response Division (2000) formalized the government's approach to metahuman management. Legislation such as the Mind Privacy Act, the Telekinetic Assault Act, and the Pyrogenetic Collateral Damage Act, along with landmark cases like Justin v. United States (2006) and Horowitz v. Sullivan (2012), further eroded the argument that personal firearms could protect against powers such as telekinesis, mind control, or invulnerability.

In 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft issued interim DOJ guidelines for law enforcement officials responding to individuals with enhanced durability. The guidelines established de-escalation as the primary objective, introduced sensory overload tactics, mandated specialized training, and required after-action reviews following any incident involving a durable metahuman.

### 2008: The Grant Administration

President James Grant's election on a platform of superhuman rights and sensible regulation marked a further political shift. His successful repeal of the controversial Superhuman Registration Act was widely seen as a repudiation of the fear-based politics that had sustained the gun rights movement.

### 2015: The New Normal

By 2015, the estimated metahuman population in the United States had grown to approximately 450,000. Household gun ownership stood at 34%, NRA membership had declined by 45%, gun-related crime had fallen by 40% since the early 1990s, and 68% of Americans supported stricter gun control, with support highest among younger generations who had grown up in a world where superpowers were an accepted reality.

## Implications

### Strategic Paradox

The government's approach to firearms reflects a deliberate strategic calculation. Rather than arming law enforcement more heavily against superhumans, policy shifted toward disarming society to preserve firearms as a last-resort tool. If the metahuman population were routinely exposed to gunfire, natural selection through Activation Events would produce a population increasingly resistant to ballistic weapons, eliminating one of the few conventional tools still capable of threatening certain metahumans. Gun control, in this context, functions as a national security strategy as much as a public safety measure.

### Law Enforcement Doctrine

The decline of firearms forced a comprehensive rethinking of law enforcement tactics. Conventional officers are no longer expected to engage superhumans with firearms. Instead, policy emphasizes de-escalation, containment, and coordination with metahuman responders or specialized NSRA units. This aligns with the broader post-Tesla Incident doctrine that superhumans should manage and regulate each other rather than being confronted by conventional forces.

### Cultural Transformation

The firearms decline represents one of the most visible cultural shifts produced by the superhuman age. A society that once defined personal liberty partly through gun ownership gradually came to view firearms as obsolete relics of a pre-metahuman world. The NRA's collapse as a political force illustrates how quickly entrenched institutions can lose relevance when the foundational assumptions supporting them are overturned.

### Self-Defense Calculus

The practical argument for gun ownership was undermined on multiple fronts. Firearms offer no meaningful protection against the majority of metahuman threats, and their use against a latent metahuman risks triggering an Activation Event that produces a more dangerous adversary. For ordinary citizens, the rational self-defense calculus shifted decisively away from firearm ownership.

## Trivia

- In 1994, a child with superhuman strength in New York City crumpled armed bank robbers' weapons into small balls, and the footage became one of the most replayed news clips of the decade.
- The classified DoD memo on firearms reduction was assigned a declassification date of April 15, 2025, suggesting the government anticipated the strategy would take approximately three decades to fully implement.
- The NSRA's 60% superhuman victory statistic in armed confrontations accounts only for one-on-one encounters and explicitly notes survivorship bias as a limitation.
- FBI background checks for firearm purchases peaked at 2.7 million in 1995, the same year public opinion decisively turned against the argument that guns were necessary in a world of superhumans.
- The DOJ's 2002 interim guidelines for responding to enhanced-durability individuals never mention firearms as a recommended tool, focusing entirely on de-escalation, sensory overload, chemical agents, and physical restraints.
