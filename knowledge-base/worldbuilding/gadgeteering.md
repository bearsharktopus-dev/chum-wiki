## Overview

Gadgeteering refers to the field of engineering technology for use by or in connection with superhumans. It spans two tracks: conventional support device engineering by baseline engineers building custom gadgets, protective gear, and reconnaissance equipment; and anomalous research involving superhuman Brain-types whose creations defy known physical laws and resist conventional reproduction.

Support devices enable heroes to operate more effectively, while anomalous research holds the potential - however elusive - to translate impossible inventions into reproducible technologies.

## Mechanics

### Conventional Support Device Engineering

Support Device Engineers work with miniaturized electronics, precision soldering, custom 3D-printed components, RF transmission systems (commonly 5.8 GHz band), weatherproofing, and battery optimization. Typical projects include utility gadgets, miniaturized reconnaissance equipment, protective gear, wearable technology, communication systems, and specialized medical devices for superhuman physiology.

Engineers consult directly with superhuman clients on operational needs, power interactions, and environmental constraints. The work demands proficiency in CAD software, microcontrollers, wireless protocols, and the PERKS Assessment system.

### Brain-Type Superhuman Creations

Brain-type metahumans are not generally intelligent but rather savants with hyper-intuitive mastery of extremely narrow scientific domains. One might design self-healing polymers instinctively yet be unable to explain the underlying chemistry, or create liquids with selective densities while lacking basic knowledge outside that specialty.

Their creations frequently defy conventional analysis - the "Microscope Breaker" problem. Standard instruments (electron microscopes, chemical assays, mass spectrometry) return scrambled, blank, or endlessly looping data, as if the underlying physical properties refuse to resolve into measurable quantities.

### The DAAS Hybrid Approach

DAAS addresses the Microscope Breaker problem by pairing superhuman researchers with baseline scientists and orchestrating collaborations between Brain-types from different specializations. DAAS also recruits Employ-types (who imbue objects with new properties) and Create-types (who conjure Anomalously Originated Material), providing further subjects for study.

### Degradation and Instability

Many superhuman-created devices degrade in functionality over time, with operational windows ranging from hours to years. No such object has remained functional indefinitely, severely limiting practical deployment and commercial viability.

## History

Early gadgeteering was largely freelance, with skilled individuals working from home workshops to provide custom devices to local heroes. This grassroots tradition persists alongside the corporate industry.

DAAS was founded in 2011 on the outskirts of Baltimore in an unmarked facility, under Director Dr. Alan Reeve, to study and translate Brain-type creations that violated known physical laws.

The corporate industry matured through companies such as HeroTech Innovations (Las Vegas), establishing formal positions and professional pathways for Support Device Engineers with salaries of $85,000 to $120,000 annually.

## Implications

### Economic and Professional Impact

The industry supports both corporate employers and freelancers, though the gap between freelance work for local heroes and recognized professional experience remains a persistent challenge.

Non-replicable superhuman-created devices fall into a legal gray area shielded from standard intellectual property laws. Questions of patent eligibility for inventions defying known physics remain open.

### Scientific Significance

Despite fundamental barriers, partial insights from studying anomalous artifacts have advanced materials science, energy efficiency, and medical technology. A notable success: a collaboration between a ceramics-specialist Brain-type and a fluid dynamics expert yielded a non-Newtonian fluid that hardens on impact, now being tested for next-generation body armor.

No fully reproducible "impossible" technology has yet reached the commercial market. The gap between anomalous creation and conventional reproduction remains the field's central unsolved problem.

### Safety and Containment

DAAS maintains a containment wing called "the Zoo" for unstable artifacts too dangerous to store conventionally, including a perpetual motion machine that ceases functioning under observation, a mirror reflecting nonexistent objects, a teleportation device that displaces objects one inch due east, and a vial of liquid that evaporates and recondenses at random locations.

Rigorous safety testing protocols apply to every new creation, with entire teams assessing liability risks for gadgets with potential to implode, explode, or cause anomalous events.

## Trivia

- The vlog "Gearheads With Greg" documents a freelance gadgeteer who operates from his parents' garage in his late twenties. Greg rebrands his freelance hero work on resumes as "Independent Contractor for Tactical Support Devices in High-Stakes Environments."
- The Zoo is so named because its contents behave unpredictably - as one anecdote puts it, a pair of boots stored there might literally jump out and bite you.
- Tungsten is referenced as a reinforcement material for its durability, used in components such as lapel pin mechanisms that must withstand field conditions.
- The DAAS teleportation device has been left in place since the last relocation attempt caused an unexplained explosion. It currently occupies itself by teleporting dust particles.
