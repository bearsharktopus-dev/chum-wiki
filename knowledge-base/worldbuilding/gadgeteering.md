## Overview

Gadgeteering refers to the broad field of engineering technology specifically intended for use by or in connection with superhumans. The discipline spans a wide spectrum, from conventional support device engineering -- building custom gadgets, protective gear, and reconnaissance equipment using off-the-shelf components -- to cutting-edge anomalous research conducted by superhuman Brain-types whose creations defy the known laws of physics.

The field operates on two distinct tracks. The first is the professional support device industry, staffed primarily by baseline (non-powered) engineers who design and fabricate practical equipment for superhuman clients. This work resembles traditional electrical and mechanical engineering, albeit with highly specialized requirements dictated by the unique operational demands of superhuman activity. The second track involves superhuman-created technology, produced by Brain-type metahumans with hyper-intuitive knowledge of narrow scientific fields. These individuals craft devices and materials that cannot be explained or reproduced through conventional science, posing fundamental challenges to reverse-engineering and mass production.

Both tracks play a critical role in the superhuman ecosystem. Support devices enable heroes and licensed metahumans to operate more effectively, while anomalous research holds the potential -- however elusive -- to translate impossible inventions into reproducible technologies that benefit the general public.

## Mechanics

### Conventional Support Device Engineering

Conventional gadgeteering relies on established engineering principles applied to the unique demands of superhuman clients. Support Device Engineers work with miniaturized electronics, precision soldering, custom 3D-printed components, RF transmission systems (commonly operating on the 5.8 GHz band), weatherproofing techniques, and battery optimization to produce compact, durable devices suited to field conditions.

Typical projects include utility gadgets, reconnaissance equipment (such as miniaturized cameras with live transmission capability), protective gear, wearable technology, communication systems, and specialized medical devices for superhuman physiology. Engineers must consult directly with superhuman clients to understand their specific operational needs, power interactions, and environmental constraints. Field testing is a standard part of the development cycle, and all products must meet regulatory safety and quality assurance standards.

The work demands proficiency in CAD software, microcontrollers, wireless communication protocols, and an understanding of the PERKS Assessment system and its implications for device design. Familiarity with wearables, biomechanics, and medical device principles is considered advantageous.

### Brain-Type Superhuman Creations

Brain-type metahumans represent the more extraordinary dimension of gadgeteering. These individuals do not simply possess enhanced intelligence in a general sense; rather, they are savants with hyper-intuitive mastery of extremely narrow scientific domains. A Brain-type might design self-healing polymers instinctively yet be unable to explain the underlying chemistry, or possess an innate grasp of fluid dynamics sufficient to create liquids with selective densities while lacking basic knowledge outside that specialty.

The devices and materials produced by Brain-types frequently defy conventional analysis -- a phenomenon known as the "Microscope Breaker" problem. When subjected to standard scientific instruments (electron microscopes, chemical assays, mass spectrometry), these creations return scrambled, blank, or endlessly looping data. The readings behave as though the underlying physical properties refuse to resolve into measurable quantities, rendering traditional reverse-engineering impossible.

### The DAAS Hybrid Approach

The Department of Applied Anomalous Sciences addresses the Microscope Breaker problem through a hybrid methodology. Superhuman researchers are paired with baseline scientists who attempt to translate intuitive, anomalous creations into functional, reproducible science. DAAS also orchestrates collaborations between Brain-types from different specializations, hoping that interactions between distinct anomalous fields might produce stable, usable technologies.

In addition to Brain-types, DAAS recruits Employ-type metahumans (who can imbue objects with new properties) and Create-types (who conjure materials from nothing). The materials produced by Create-types, classified as Anomalously Originated Material (AOM), often defy traditional chemistry and physics entirely, providing further subjects for study.

### Degradation and Instability

A significant limitation of superhuman-created technology is its finite lifespan. Many devices and materials produced by metahumans degrade in functionality over time, with operational windows ranging from hours to years. No superhuman-created object has been observed to remain functional indefinitely. This degradation, combined with the inability to replicate these creations through conventional means, severely limits their practical deployment and commercial viability.

## History

The informal practice of building support equipment for superhumans predates the formalization of the field. Early gadgeteering was largely a freelance endeavor, with skilled individuals working independently -- often from home workshops or garages -- to provide custom devices to local heroes and vigilantes. This grassroots tradition persists alongside the more structured corporate industry.

The Department of Applied Anomalous Sciences was founded in 2011 in response to the growing scientific crisis posed by Brain-type superhumans who were producing tangible, functional technology that violated known physical laws. Located on the outskirts of Baltimore in an unmarked facility, DAAS was established with the mission of studying and understanding these impossible creations. Under the directorship of Dr. Alan Reeve, the department has pursued incremental progress in translating anomalous artifacts into usable science.

The corporate support device industry matured in parallel, with companies such as HeroTech Innovations (based in Las Vegas, Nevada) establishing formal engineering positions, standardized qualifications, and professional development pathways for Support Device Engineers. The field now encompasses both independent contractors and full-time corporate employees, with salaries in the range of $85,000 to $120,000 annually for qualified engineers.

## Implications

### Economic and Professional Impact

Gadgeteering has established itself as a legitimate professional field within the broader superhuman economy. The industry supports both corporate employers and independent freelancers, though the job market is competitive. Engineers without formal corporate experience often struggle to find employment despite extensive practical portfolios, and the gap between freelance work for local heroes and recognized professional experience remains a persistent challenge.

The intellectual property landscape for superhuman-created technology is largely unresolved. Devices that cannot be replicated fall into a legal gray area, classified as "non-replicable anomalous artifacts" and shielded from standard intellectual property laws. Questions of patent eligibility for inventions that defy known physics remain open.

### Scientific Significance

Despite the fundamental barriers to understanding superhuman-created technology, DAAS and related research efforts have produced tangible downstream benefits. Partial insights gleaned from studying anomalous artifacts have advanced conventional research in materials science, energy efficiency, and medical technology. A notable success involved a collaboration between a ceramics-specialist Brain-type and a fluid dynamics expert, which yielded a non-Newtonian fluid that hardens on impact -- a material now being tested for next-generation body armor and producible at lower cost with more commonly available components.

However, no fully reproducible "impossible" technology has yet reached the commercial market. The gap between anomalous creation and conventional reproduction remains the central unsolved problem of the field.

### Safety and Containment

The unpredictable nature of superhuman-created devices necessitates extensive safety infrastructure. DAAS maintains a dedicated containment wing known as "the Zoo," housing unstable artifacts too dangerous or poorly understood to store conventionally. These include objects such as a perpetual motion machine that ceases functioning under observation, a mirror that reflects nonexistent objects, a teleportation device that displaces objects one inch due east (and which caused an unexplained explosion when last moved), and a vial of liquid that evaporates and recondenses at random locations within the facility.

Rigorous safety testing protocols are applied to every new creation, even when the device's function is not fully understood. Entire teams are dedicated to assessing liability risks for gadgets with potential to implode, explode, or cause localized anomalous events.
