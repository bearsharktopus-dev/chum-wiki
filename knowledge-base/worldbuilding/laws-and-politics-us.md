## Overview

The United States has developed one of the world's most extensive legal frameworks for metahuman governance. Beginning with ad hoc discussions in the mid-1980s and accelerating after September 11, 2001, American metahuman policy has evolved through landmark Supreme Court decisions, federal legislation, and shifting presidential administrations. The framework addresses criminal prosecution, civil rights protections, licensing and registration, healthcare access, digital privacy, and institutional infrastructure for a population of approximately 500,000 powered individuals.

Metahuman policy does not align neatly with traditional partisan divisions. Republican President Laura Stewart signed the permissive LUMA Act of 2013, while Democrat Samuel Rodriguez expanded healthcare protections despite opposition from the "New Hawks," a radical religious faction within the Republican Party. Public opinion remains divided, with approximately 55% supporting current policies and only 40% trusting government handling of metahuman affairs.

The overarching policy philosophy holds that superhumans should manage and regulate each other, with conventional law enforcement in a supporting role - an approach shaped by the Tesla Incident of 2011, which demonstrated the catastrophic consequences of conventional forces engaging superhumans without adequate preparation.

## Mechanics

### Institutional Framework

The primary federal body overseeing metahuman regulation is the National Superhuman Response Agency (NSRA), established in 2002 by Public Law 107-91 as an independent agency within the Department of Defense. It absorbed the functions of its predecessor, the Superhuman Study and Response Division (SSRD, est. 2000), and operates through four divisions: Intelligence, Operations, Science & Technology, and Public Affairs. The NSRA administers the PERKS assessment system, manages LUMA licensing, and coordinates with federal, state, and local law enforcement.

### Licensing System (LUMA)

The License to Utilize Metahuman Abilities (LUMA) Act of 2013 established a voluntary licensing system. A LUMA is not required for simply possessing powers but is mandatory for any occupational use, including law enforcement assistance and workplace applications. The license costs $40 for an initial interview and $20 for biennial renewal. A Juvenile LUMA (JLUMA) variant for metahumans under 18 requires annual renewal. Unlicensed public use of powers is a misdemeanor ($250 fine), while employing unlicensed metahumans carries fines starting at $25,000. LUMA holders receive Good Samaritan protections for life-saving acts performed with their abilities.

### Criminal Law and Prosecution

Metahuman criminal law rests on *United States v. Davis* (2005), which held that superhuman abilities may be legally categorized as weapons when used in the commission of a crime. The ruling formalized the term "Felony-Enabled Superhuman Operative" (FESO) for individuals who adopt a nom-de-crime and commit felonies using their powers. The Court clarified that this framework does not authorize detention or prosecution of non-criminal metahumans.

*United States v. Gibson* (2017) established that individuals coerced by mind-controlling metahumans should receive leniency, while the metahuman exercising coercion bears full criminal responsibility. Gibson received multiple life sentences and is incarcerated at the Daedalus Correctional Facility.

### Civil Rights Protections

The Supreme Court struck down the Superhuman Registration Act of 2008 in a 6-3 decision, finding that its mandatory registration, warrantless tracking, and sweeping data-sharing provisions violated the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Chief Justice Roberts' majority opinion criticized the Act's vague definitions and lack of due process, while Justice Scalia's dissent argued that superhumans posed a compelling government interest.

*State of New York v. Sentry Insurance* (2007) ruled 5-4 that charging higher premiums based solely on superhuman status violates the Equal Protection Clause, prompting federal and state regulatory changes.

The Digital Privacy Act of 2015 established safeguards for superhuman digital data and criminalized using metahuman abilities to access private data. *Riley v. California* further held that warrantless search of personal data stored within a superhuman's body is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.

### Healthcare Legislation

Metahuman healthcare policy developed incrementally. Stewart's 2013 ACA revisions initiated federal engagement, the Health and Superhuman Services Act of 2018 expanded this foundation, and the Superhuman Healthcare Act of 2021 (Rodriguez administration, supported by Senators Warren and Sanders) prohibited overt discrimination by healthcare providers and insurers. Licensed Vigilantes and Registered Superhuman Entities have access to specialized healthcare accommodating their unique physiology and secret identity requirements.

## History

### Early Legislative Response (1986-2001)

The first U.S. Activation Event in 1986 - a five-year-old in Virginia tearing through an overturned car - prompted initial legislative discussions, with Congressman Lawrence Baxter involved in early government response. The Cedar Mills Incident of 1989, where a child's activation generated a tornado causing tens of millions in property damage, intensified calls for preparedness. By the mid-1990s, with superhuman emergence growing at 8.2% annually, the National Superhuman Registration Database (1995) and the Pivot Protocols (1997) were established, organizing government response around Identification, Containment, and Response.

### Post-9/11 Expansion (2001-2005)

Significant superhuman involvement in the September 11 rescue efforts catalyzed the NSRA's creation in 2002. The Geneva Summit of 1999 had already laid groundwork for international coordination, leading to the International Superhuman Coalition in 2005. Domestically, *United States v. Davis* (2005) established the foundational criminal law framework.

### The Stewart Administration (2012-2020)

Republican Laura Stewart, elected in 2012 after defeating Democrat James Grant, campaigned on superhuman security following the Tesla Incident. Her administration took a libertarian approach, signing the LUMA Act of 2013 and revising the ACA. Her tenure also saw the Digital Privacy Act and antitrust reforms of 2015, the latter widely regarded as retaliatory against Apple for refusing FBI encryption backdoors. The Pink Mist Incident of 2017, in which an unregistered vigilante delivered the severed heads of crime lords and supervillains to the White House, sparked national debate about vigilante justice.

### The Rodriguez Administration (2020-present)

Democrat Samuel Rodriguez defeated Joshua Bradshaw of the "New Hawks" faction and has governed with a narrow majority. His administration passed the Superhuman Healthcare Act of 2021 and the Transgender Health Protections Act. The Supreme Court underwent significant changes: Justice Ginsburg was replaced by Justice Kethledge (2021), Justice Clarence Thomas died at 73 and was replaced by progressive-leaning Justice Goodwin Hon Liu, and Kethledge's sudden death in a 2023 car collision led to the controversial nomination of 42-year-old Phoebe Byron from the Ninth Circuit.

## Implications

Approximately 65% of the 500,000 U.S. metahumans work in conventional employment, while 35% engage in "cape collar" work. Roughly 71% of active heroes hold a LUMA license, compared to only 38% of civilian metahumans, suggesting many non-combatant metahumans use powers without formal authorization.

The tiered legal classification system - Unlicensed (~30%), Licensed (~60%), and Registered (~10%) Metahuman Entities - creates a structured gradient of oversight and privilege. The criminal classification system allocates enforcement resources proportionally, from standard attention for Known Superhuman Criminals up to satellite surveillance and pre-approved lethal force for Classified Threat Entities.

The LUMA program costs approximately $50 million annually to administer. Critics remain divided: some view any licensing as overreach, while others argue current protections fall short, particularly in healthcare and research funding. Public sympathy for some supervillains exists, the "New Hawks" push for more restrictive policies, and progressive advocates seek expanded social services and anti-discrimination protections.

## Trivia

- The Registration Act would have required crime-fighting metahumans to wear government-issued tracking devices and imposed escalating fines starting at $500, doubling every 30 days.
- The FESO designation is the legal system's formal equivalent of "supervillain." The *Davis* case involved a telekinetic bank robber operating under the nom-de-crime "Phantom Hand."
- Stewart's ACA revision was considered so out of character for a pro-business Republican that it fueled rumors she had a metahuman family member - specifically a "Candle" or a "22er."
- Justice Kethledge served only approximately two years on the Supreme Court before dying in what was reported as a car collision, with the circumstances fueling numerous conspiracy theories.
