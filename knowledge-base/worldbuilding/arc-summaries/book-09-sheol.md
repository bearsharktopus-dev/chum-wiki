## Summary

Book 9 opens weeks after the zoo heist, with Sam increasingly isolated as her friends advance toward conventional futures — Jordan accepts a full MIT scholarship, Connor's adoption proceeds, Maggie recovers from her zoo injuries. Two interludes bracket the transition: LTN.2 shows Dr. Trinh-Norwood (Mrs. Xenograft) presenting her new drug "Hypeman" (Compound J-237) to Mr. Antithesis at his sterile Manhattan office, revealing that it's derived from Jump chemistry, requires poison dart frog compounds for stability, uses cultured cells from Daisy Zhen, and is fatally incompatible with Jump when mixed. VB.1 introduces Victor Blanc — Sam's paternal grandfather, whose existence she is unaware of — in a 1960s childhood flashback at the Philadelphia Zoo and a school disciplinary meeting, establishing his pattern-oriented thinking, his WWII-veteran father's philosophy of finishing fights, and his capacity for violence.

The main arc ignites when a bright red fire with a metallic smell appears in a garbage can outside Sam's school, triggering an intense panic attack centered in her right hand — where Aaron McKinley previously removed her fingernails. Sam flees to the library, where Jordan finds her. Attempts to cope through normal activities fail; Sam sneaks out at 2 AM to patrol, and Jordan confronts her with the question she can't answer: who is she without the mask? The team conducts controlled fire experiments, discovering Sam's reactions are strongest in familiar territory near the school. During testing, they respond to a real fire at Amy's Coffee Shop — sprinkler system sabotaged, accelerants placed methodically — where Sam rescues an unconscious woman. Jordan maps the fires and discovers they form a circle around Tacony Charter Academy. The Auditors identify Aaron McKinley as the perpetrator, confirmed by Sundial's psychometric investigation at the burned coffee shop.

Aaron's psychological warfare escalates: he places a nail salon gift card with a hammer sticker in Sam's locker, delivered through a chain of unwitting intermediaries (from dealer to John to Melissa Marshall to Sam's locker), demonstrating his ability to reach her without direct contact. Community response splits between constructive and problematic: Parabellum and Egalitarian organize civilian defense walks (with Parabellum expressing concerning surveillance-state views), while Sandman maintains covert watch over Sam's neighborhood. The Delaware Valley Defenders are absent, occupied with a three-day hostage crisis in West Philadelphia. Sam teams up with Derek Taylor, using his enhanced werewolf sense of smell to track Aaron's scent from the gift card envelope through Tacony-Mayfair — discovering Aaron has been systematically surveilling her school entrances, the Music Hall, and her regular locations. They track him to a red Camry under the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge, where he's been living. The confrontation goes badly: Aaron attacks with evolved fire powers (red flames hotter than before, thick white smoke), injures both Sam and Derek, and escapes in a smokescreen. Aaron then breaks into the Music Hall, fights through Jordan (baseball bat) and Tasha (fire extinguisher), and during the chase demonstrates a new white fire ability that surprises even him. The crisis peaks when Sam's sleeve bursts into red flames during a school evacuation, injuring her and six other students.

Hospitalized with second-degree burns, Sam escapes Jefferson-Frankford Hospital at midnight, navigates a chaotic Philadelphia full of copycat arsons and civilian patrols, and discovers Kate Smith's house ablaze. The fire's circumstances are ambiguous — Aaron is the presumed perpetrator, but Kate is found with what appear to be self-inflicted wounds on her forearms. Sam rescues Kate through a second-story window, performs CPR when Kate's airway swells shut, and demands that Crossroads use his precognitive abilities to locate Aaron. After slapping Crossroads in frustration, he agrees and directs her to an abandoned house near Vogt Park. The final confrontation is the arc's brutal climax: Aaron has prepared the house (soaked walls, gasoline, Duraflame starters), and the fight progresses through multiple phases — verbal sparring, Sam crashing through the floor with an elbow drop, close-quarters combat with pipe and hammer, a gasoline explosion, fire suppressant foam blinding Aaron, and a final beating where Sam methodically dislocates his shoulder and damages his elbow. Aaron is arrested. Sam emerges severely injured — burns, smoke inhalation, broken bones, concussion.

The aftermath is explored in two interludes: MM.3 is Kate's hospital admission report at Jefferson-Frankford, documenting her injuries (respiratory distress, carbon monoxide exposure, forearm lacerations described as "consistent with sharp object injury," Lichtenberg scarring from a prior lightning strike). RS.2 follows Rachel Small's POV as the families — Smalls, Kate's father Liam, all the kids — take a healing trip to Kalahari water park in the Poconos. Sam confesses to Rachel that she permanently disabled Aaron's arm after he was already cornered, grappling with the satisfaction she felt in the moment and the guilt that followed. Rachel internally connects Sam's capacity for violence to her own estranged father Victor Blanc, wondering if the cycle of violence can be broken. The interlude ends with parents bonding over the impossibility of raising these particular children.

## Chapter List

| # | File | Summary |
|---|------|---------|
| LTN.2 | ltn-2.txt | INTERLUDE — Mrs. Xenograft POV. Lena Trinh-Norwood presents "Hypeman" (Compound J-237) to Mr. Antithesis at his sterile Manhattan office, explaining its derivation from Jump chemistry, its reliance on poison dart frog compounds, its use of cultured Daisy Zhen cells, and its fatal incompatibility with Jump. Mr. Antithesis accepts the report and warns against future failures. Scylla (chimerized greyhound-lobster) waits outside with Zenith, as Mr. Antithesis's power negatively affects superpower-created things. |
| VB.1 | vb-1.txt | INTERLUDE — Victor Blanc POV, 1960s Philadelphia. Sam's unknown paternal grandfather visits the zoo as a child with his mother, showing pattern-oriented thinking (fascinated by the panther's predictable path, connecting with the silverback gorilla). In a linked school scene, Victor breaks a classmate's nose in response to a racial slur ("spastic dago"); his WWII-veteran father supports him, establishing the philosophy: don't start fights, finish them. |
| 136 | 136.txt | Weeks after the zoo. Sam grows isolated as friends advance: Jordan gets a full MIT scholarship, Connor's adoption proceeds, Maggie recovers. Solo patrols. Shabbat dinner at Pop-Pop Moe's in Ventnor. Walking home from school, Sam encounters a bright red fire in a garbage can — experiences a severe panic attack centered in her right hand (where Aaron removed her fingernails) and flees. |
| 137 | 137.txt | Sam flees to Tacony Library; Jordan finds her via location sharing. At the Music Hall, Sam takes lithium, they watch anime and eat pizza. At 2 AM Sam sneaks out to patrol, spends hours collecting trash in Tacony. Jordan confronts her at 5 AM: who is she without the mask? Sam cannot answer. |
| 138 | 138.txt | Controlled fire experiments with Jordan and Tasha — Sam's reactions strongest near the school (territorial response). During testing, they respond to a real fire at Amy's Coffee Shop (sabotaged sprinklers, deliberately set). Sam rescues an unconscious woman; uses a tooth grown from her elbow to break a window when trapped. Jordan helps evacuate with space manipulation powers. |
| 139 | 139.txt | Fire aftermath investigation. Witnesses describe a man watching the building, bright red light before smoke. Jordan maps the fires — they form a circle around Tacony Charter Academy. The team considers and reluctantly identifies Aaron McKinley as the likely perpetrator. Bucks County incidents show his power evolution (yellow → blue → red fire). New fire reported near Torresdale. |
| 140 | 140.txt | Sundial uses psychometry at the burned coffee shop, confirming Aaron: methodical accelerant placement, sabotaged sprinklers (gum in valves), the perpetrator stayed to watch the rescue. Aaron's former Tacony Coyotes gang members revealed dead in a supposed drive-by. Moonshot and Compass provide support. Sundial offers Sandman to watch Sam's neighborhood. Sketch broadcast confirms Aaron's identity. |
| 141 | 141.txt | Sam attends school under strain. Melissa invites her to community defense walks organized by Parabellum and Egalitarian. The patrol reveals tensions between protection and profiling. Sam returns home to find Sandman disguised as a homeless person watching her street. Next morning: a nail salon gift card with a hammer sticker in her locker — Aaron's psychological warfare. Panic attack. |
| 142 | 142.txt | Sam and Principal Heckerman review security footage: Melissa Marshall placed the envelope. Investigation traces the chain — Melissa got it from John, who got it from his drug dealer, who got it from Aaron. A $40 chain of unwitting intermediaries. DVDs absent (three-day hostage situation in West Philly). Fury Forge inspects the school's fire safety. Sam resolves: scared, but now also angry. |
| 143 | 143.txt | Fury Forge provides Sam with specialized fire-fighting gear (fire blanket, foam capsules, smoke mask). Sam and Derek track Aaron using his werewolf sense of smell — from the gift card to the nail salon to a surveillance pattern covering Sam's school, the Music Hall, and her regular haunts. They find Aaron's red Camry under the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge. Fight breaks out: Aaron attacks with evolved red flames and white smoke, injures both Sam and Derek. Aaron escapes. Derek needs to get home before werewolf transformation. |
| 144 | 144.txt | Sam debriefs at the Music Hall; tension with friends over reckless behavior. Late night: Aaron breaks into the Music Hall, Jordan hits him with a baseball bat, Aaron retaliates with yellow flames. Chase through Tacony streets — Aaron demonstrates new white fire (surprising himself). Next day at school: fire alarm, evacuation, then Sam's sleeve spontaneously bursts into red flames in front of the entire school, injuring her and six students. |
| 145 | 145.txt | Sam hospitalized at Jefferson-Frankford with second-degree burns. Officer Harper interviews her. DVDs arrive (Multiplex, Captain Plasma, Crossroads) to question her. Private meeting with Crossroads — he uses precognitive "cheating" to extract information about Aaron's identity and powers. Dr. Patel projects 3-4 months recovery (Sam estimates 4-5 days). Sam calls her parents at Pop-Pop Moe's. Plans escape; slips out at midnight during a late-night emergency distraction. |
| 146 | 146.txt | Sam navigates chaotic nighttime Philadelphia: civilian patrols in reflective vests, Multiplex coordinating with police, Moonshot patrolling from above, Jump users testing powers in alleys, copycat arsons everywhere. Tense phone call with her father (claims to be with "Sputnik" in West Philly). Encounters Sandman near her house — intense debate about revenge vs. justice. Sam discovers Kate Smith's house on fire. |
| 147 | 147.txt | Sam enters Kate's burning house through the kitchen window using fire suppression pellets. Finds Kate unconscious upstairs with cuts along her forearms (ambiguous — self-inflicted or Aaron's doing). Drops Kate to neighbors' blanket from window, performs CPR when Kate's airway swells shut. Crossroads arrives with paramedics. Sam slaps Crossroads, demands he use precognition to find Aaron. He reluctantly agrees, flips his coin. |
| 148 | 148.txt | Crossroads directs Sam to an abandoned house near Vogt Park. Aaron has prepared it: soaked walls, gasoline, Duraflame starters, mattress. Multi-phase fight: verbal sparring, Sam crashes through floor (elbow drop), close-quarters with pipe and hammer, gasoline explosion, foam capsule blinds Aaron, final brutal beating. Sam dislocates Aaron's shoulder and damages his elbow — deliberately, after he's cornered. Firefighters and police arrive. Aaron arrested. Arc 9 ends. |
| MM.3 | mm-3.txt | INTERLUDE — Medical document format. Kate Smith's hospital admission report at Jefferson-Frankford. Documents respiratory distress, carbon monoxide exposure, first-degree burns, and forearm lacerations "consistent with sharp object injury." Notes Lichtenberg scarring from prior lightning strike, previous cardiovascular irregularities. Oxygen saturation 89%, intubated and sedated. |
| RS.2 | rs-2.txt | INTERLUDE — Rachel Small POV. The morning after Aaron's arrest: Kate's father Liam deals with insurance paperwork (payout frozen pending supervillain vs. arson determination). The families drive to Kalahari water park in the Poconos — Sam, Maggie, Jordan, Tasha, Kate, with Rachel, Ben, and Liam. Sam confesses to Rachel that she permanently disabled Aaron's arm after he was already cornered, struggling with the satisfaction she felt and the guilt that followed. Rachel internally connects Sam's violence to her estranged father Victor Blanc, wondering if the cycle can be broken. Parents bond over raising impossible children. |

## Themes

- **The violence you choose** — The arc's moral center is Sam's deliberate decision to disable Aaron's arm after he's already cornered. Her confession to Rachel in RS.2 — "It felt satisfying in this gross, animal way. Like what a cat probably feels when they catch a bird" — forces a reckoning with the pleasure of righteous violence. Rachel's internal connection to Victor Blanc frames this as potentially hereditary, questioning whether the capacity for cruelty is a family inheritance.
- **Identity beyond the mask** — Jordan's 5 AM question ("Who are you without the mask?") haunts the arc. Sam's inability to answer drives her compulsive patrolling, her trash-collecting, her need to always be doing something heroic. The arc suggests that Sam has so thoroughly fused her identity with Bloodhound that she may not survive losing the role.
- **The stalker's pattern** — Aaron's campaign mirrors domestic abuse: escalating from distant threats (fire pattern around the school) to personal violation (the locker gift card) to physical attack (setting her on fire) to attacking her loved ones (Kate's house). The fires forming a literal circle around Sam's school visualize the tightening noose of obsession.
- **Institutional absence** — The DVDs are occupied with a three-day hostage situation, leaving Sam to face Aaron with minimal adult support. This vacuum allows both the crisis and the problematic community response (Parabellum's surveillance patrols) to escalate. The arc continues Book 8's theme of institutional impotence forcing individual action.
- **Ambiguity and self-harm** — Kate's house fire introduces deliberate ambiguity: Aaron is presumed responsible, but Kate is found with forearm lacerations that the medical report describes as "consistent with sharp object injury." The MM.3 hospital report carefully avoids attributing the cuts, and Sam's emotional distance from Kate in RS.2 suggests she may suspect the truth.

## Threads Planted

- **Hypeman (Compound J-237)** — Xenograft's new drug derived from Jump chemistry using poison dart frog compounds and cultured Daisy Zhen cells; fatally incompatible with Jump when mixed; approved by Mr. Antithesis for development and distribution (LTN.2)
- **Mr. Antithesis's power** — His ability negatively affects superpower-created things (Scylla can't enter his presence); the exact nature and scope of this anti-power effect are unexplored (LTN.2)
- **Victor Blanc** — Sam's paternal grandfather, whose existence she is unaware of; Rachel's estranged father with a capacity for violence; 1960s Philadelphia childhood with a "finish fights" philosophy; Rachel internally fears Sam may have inherited his violent tendencies (VB.1, RS.2)
- **Aaron McKinley's evolved fire powers** — His abilities have progressed from yellow to blue to red to white fire, with the white fire surprising even him; the mechanism of this evolution (natural progression, drug-related, or something else) is unexplained (Chs. 143–144)
- **Kate Smith's forearm lacerations** — The MM.3 medical report notes "linear lacerations consistent with sharp object injury" on Kate's forearms, separate from fire burns; whether these are self-inflicted or caused by Aaron remains deliberately ambiguous (MM.3, Ch. 147)
- **Sam and Kate's emotional distance** — After the fire, Sam and Kate are "distant" and "stilted" in ways Rachel notices but can't explain; Sam watches Kate out of the corner of her eye at Kalahari; the rift's cause is unresolved (RS.2)
- **Sam's capacity for excessive violence** — She permanently disabled Aaron's arm after he was already cornered, feeling animal satisfaction in the moment; Rachel connects this to Victor Blanc; whether Sam can reconcile this with her self-image as a hero is the arc's lingering question (Ch. 148, RS.2)
- **Aaron's permanent disability** — Surgery didn't go well; he'll never use his arm the same way; the consequences of this for future encounters or legal proceedings are unexplored (RS.2)
- **Scylla (Xenograft's chimeric pet)** — A greyhound chimerized with a dead lobster, giving it an iridescent carapace shell; not created with powers (born normally, then modified); loyal to Xenograft; its capabilities and role are unexplored (LTN.2)
- **Hypeman-Jump fatal interaction** — Mixing the two drugs is lethal; this could become a weapon or an accidental mass-casualty event; the interaction's mechanism is unexplained (LTN.2)
- **Daisy Zhen's cultured cells** — Xenograft has cultured cells from Daisy Zhen (Deathgirl) to create Compound B for Hypeman; the source of these cells and their connection to Project Hollywood are unexplored (LTN.2)
- **Copycat arsons across Philadelphia** — Aaron's fires inspire imitators with orange-green flames, making it difficult to track the real threat; the broader social phenomenon of copycat powered crime is noted (Chs. 146, RS.2)
- **Liam Smith's insurance battle** — Payout frozen pending determination of whether the fire was a "supervillain attack" or "ordinary arson"; highlights the legal and financial infrastructure struggling to adapt to superhuman reality (RS.2)
- **Tacony Coyotes deceased** — Aaron's former gang members are dead, supposedly in a drive-by shooting; whether Aaron killed them or someone else did is unresolved (Ch. 140)
- **Jordan's MIT departure looming** — Full scholarship accepted; Jordan's eventual departure from Philadelphia will remove one of Sam's most critical support pillars (Ch. 136)

## Threads Progressed

- **Aaron McKinley as threat** (planted Book 1/2) — Aaron returns with dramatically evolved fire powers, conducting a sophisticated psychological warfare campaign including a stalking pattern of fires around Sam's school, intermediary-chain intimidation, breaking into the Music Hall, setting Sam on fire at school, and burning Kate's house. Captured and arrested after a brutal final fight (Chs. 136–148)
- **Kingdom drug operations** (planted Book 2) — Xenograft's Hypeman represents the next generation of the Kingdom's drug enterprise, derived from Jump chemistry but using new compounds including stolen poison dart frog material (the frogs Mrs. Heartbeat escaped with in Book 8) and cultured Deathgirl cells; Mr. Antithesis approves the project (LTN.2)
- **Operation Ivory consequences** (planted Book 8, Ch. 134) — The stolen poison dart frogs from the zoo heist are confirmed as essential to Hypeman production, connecting the Book 8 heist directly to the Kingdom's drug development pipeline; Xenograft takes responsibility for Nothing and Mudslide's capture (LTN.2)
- **Sam's mental health and medication** (planted Intermission 4.5, Ch. 64) — Sam takes lithium during the fire-triggered panic attack; her inability to answer Jordan's identity question suggests the medication isn't addressing her fundamental psychological issues; she compulsively patrols and collects trash as coping mechanisms (Chs. 136–137)
- **Sam's physical and psychological limits** (planted Book 4) — Sam sustains second-degree burns, broken bones, smoke inhalation, and a concussion across the arc; her regeneration is noted (Dr. Patel projects months, Sam estimates days) but the psychological toll deepens — she experiences panic attacks, identity crisis, and moral reckoning over excessive violence (Chs. 136–148, RS.2)
- **The Auditors' operations** (planted Book 7, Chs. 110–111) — The team operates independently to investigate and respond to the fire crisis with minimal DVD support; Jordan maps patterns, Tasha documents experiments, Derek tracks scents; the Music Hall is directly attacked for the first time (Chs. 137–144)
- **Ben Small and Rachel Small's awareness** (planted Book 1) — Rachel narrates a full interlude processing Sam's confession about excessive violence; the parents explicitly discuss the weight of raising a superhero; Rachel's internal connection to Victor Blanc adds generational depth; Ben and Rachel shelter at Pop-Pop Moe's during the crisis (RS.2, Chs. 145–146)
- **Kate Smith / Miss Mayfly** (planted Book 5) — Kate's house burns down (ambiguously); the medical report suggests possible self-harm; her relationship with Sam becomes strained; she recovers at Kalahari with the group (Chs. 146–147, MM.3, RS.2)
- **Crossroads as ally** (planted Book 6) — Crossroads uses his precognitive "cheating" to extract information about Aaron at the hospital, then reluctantly uses his coin to locate Aaron after Sam slaps him; his power has practical limits (he gives Sam one hour before backup) (Chs. 145, 147–148)
- **Sundial and the Tacony Titans** (planted Book 5) — Sundial uses psychometry to investigate the arson, providing critical evidence identifying Aaron; offers Sandman for neighborhood surveillance; Moonshot and Compass provide additional support (Ch. 140)
- **Pattinson's Pals in the community** (planted Book 7) — Parabellum and Egalitarian organize civilian defense patrols in response to the fires, positioning themselves as community protectors while expressing concerning surveillance-state views that blur the line between safety and authoritarianism (Ch. 141)
- **Derek Taylor's dual nature** (planted Book 2) — Derek's werewolf condition creates a hard time constraint (he must get home before transformation) during the bridge fight with Aaron; his enhanced daytime senses make him a critical tracker; his father's criminal background (revealed in DT.1) adds context to his willingness to operate outside the law (Ch. 143)
- **Sam's identity management** (planted Book 1) — Sam's secret identity becomes further compromised when she's set on fire at school (connecting Bloodhound's fire-related trauma to civilian Sam's incident); she uses cover stories with her father and hospital staff (Chs. 144–146)

## Threads Resolved

- **Aaron McKinley's fire campaign** — Aaron's escalating psychological warfare and arson attacks are ended when Sam tracks him to the Vogt Park house and defeats him in brutal hand-to-hand combat; he is arrested and taken into custody with permanent arm damage (planted Chs. 136–144, resolved Ch. 148)
- **Connor Spindle's adoption** — Connor is officially adopted during this arc, completing the CPS evaluation process established in Book 8 (planted Book 8 Ch. 129, resolved Ch. 136)
