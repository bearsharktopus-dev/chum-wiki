## Summary

Book 7 opens on Sam's first day of sophomore year at Tacony Charter Academy, where heightened post-Chernobyl security measures have transformed the school into a pressure cooker. Racist security guard Officer Ridley assaults a Black freshman named James over a hat violation; Sam intervenes with an Aikido throw, earning a week of detention. Sam and Jordan investigate the connection between the school's security guards and local law enforcement, trailing Ridley to Patty's Bar, a cop hangout where they discover Patriot and Egalitarian among the regulars - crystallizing the arc's central conflict: the institutional alliance between police, private security, and Pattinson's Pals operating under the banner of public safety.

Sam, Jordan, Derek, and Spindle launch an anonymous whistleblower website exposing security guard misconduct, which goes viral and attracts both legal support and DDOS attacks. Sam continues mentoring Flashpoint, training her repulsion field abilities in an abandoned Tacony lot. Zero, a power-negating member of Pattinson's Pals new to this arc, stalks and chases Sam and Maggie through the streets. The pair escape to the Tacony Music Hall - Jordan's secret base - where they find Jordan, Spindle, and Tasha already present. This crisis galvanizes the group into the resistance cell that will become the Auditors. Meanwhile, at Rosh Hashanah dinner, Uncle Shelly drunkenly reveals that Pop-Pop Moe helped build Daedalus Correctional Facility. During the Tashlich ceremony, Abigail deduces Sam's identity as Bloodhound. Chernobyl is sentenced to fifty years at Aurora Springs Residential Facility.

The team spends weeks surveilling Patriot and his associates, gathering incriminating evidence through dumpster diving, directional microphones, and Sam's blood-tracking. Sam records Patriot discussing anti-superhuman legislation and a private security empire. Jordan schedules the evidence dump to coincide with homecoming, providing the team an alibi. The plan backfires: Patriot, Egalitarian, and police storm the dance to arrest Jordan on cyberterrorism charges. Egalitarian's vertigo power incapacitates everyone in the gymnasium except those with superpowers. Sam steps between Patriot and Jordan; Patriot beats her savagely in front of the entire school. A "Spartacus" moment erupts as students and teachers - led by Mr. Weston and Mike Giannopoulos - form a human shield. Jordan escapes. Sam is hospitalized.

Sam returns to school battered but unbroken. The website is taken down via legal injunction. At a full DVD meeting, Sam announces her congressional testimony, scheduled since August. She travels to D.C. with her parents to testify before a Senate oversight committee as Bloodhound. She observes testimony from NSRA Director Margaret Huang, Special Agent Shaw, Commissioner Faraday, DEA Agent Michael Turner, Mayor Watkins, DA Carla Alvarez, and Dr. Emily Nakamura. Sam's testimony focuses on the personal cost of being a teenage hero, systemic failures, and the need for independent oversight. After her return, Devonte and Akilah visit with intelligence on Project Titan - a classified military program that created enhanced soldiers - identifying Patriot as an original test subject and war criminal. They also provide physical evidence of Egalitarian's Fly use. Sam confronts Patriot at a protest at Dilworth Park, engaging him in a philosophical exchange before arranging a private meeting.

The arc culminates on Halloween night in an abandoned warehouse at Penn Treaty Park. Sam arrives prepared with tripwires, a light killswitch (Tasha operates remotely), pig blood spray, pepper spray, and a syringe gauntlet. The fight is brutal: Patriot breaks Sam's wrist, dislocates her shoulder, and cracks her ribs, while Sam breaks his nose twice and bites his collarbone. When her helmet shatters, Patriot recognizes her. Sam injects him with what she claims is slow-acting poison (actually saline) and negotiates a truce: Patriot stands down, leaves Jordan alone, and confines operations to South Philly, or Sam releases the evidence and exposes Egalitarian's Fly use to DA Alvarez. Patriot reluctantly agrees. Sam leaves a first aid kit as a final gesture of mercy.

## Themes

- **Security as oppression** - The title operates on multiple levels: the "security" measures at Tacony Charter suppress students rather than protect them; Pattinson's Pals use "public safety" to justify harassment and intimidation; Patriot's private security ambitions are a vehicle for power rather than protection. The arc asks who is made secure and at whose expense.
- **Civilian activism vs. institutional power** - Sam and her friends fight back not with superpowers but with journalism, whistleblower websites, legal action, and congressional testimony. The arc positions information and truth-telling as more threatening to the power structure than any physical confrontation.
- **The making and unmaking of heroes** - Patriot's interlude reveals a man forged by abuse and institutional violence into a weapon who calls himself a hero. Sam's trajectory mirrors his in some respects (physical suffering, determination, a desperate need to prove worth), making the warehouse confrontation a battle between two people shaped by the same forces who chose different paths.
- **Family legacies and complicity** - Pop-Pop Moe's Daedalus involvement, Great-Grandpa Elijah's HUAC investigation, and Patriot's father's abuse all demonstrate how family history shapes present action. Sam inherits both the guilt of complicity and the imperative to resist.
- **Bluffing as survival** - Sam's victories in Book 7 come not through superior force but through deception: the saline "poison," the bluff about knowing DA Alvarez, the reverse-pickpocketing of Patriot. The arc frames cunning and psychological warfare as legitimate tools for the outmatched.

## Threads Planted

- **Project Titan** - Devonte and Akilah reveal the existence of a classified military program that attempted to create enhanced soldiers through artificial power induction; Patriot is identified as an original test subject; the full scope, other participants, and who authorized it remain unknown (Ch. 116)
- **Egalitarian's Fly use** - Physical evidence (dried blood containing Fly traces) proves Egalitarian is using the superpower-granting drug; this information is used as leverage against Patriot but has not been publicly released; its wider implications for Pattinson's Pals' credibility are unexplored (Chs. 116–118)
- **The Auditors' formation** - The proto-team assembles at the Tacony Music Hall: Sam, Jordan, Tasha, Spindle, Derek, and Maggie; Jordan names them "Auditors" and establishes the team dynamic; this represents the nucleus of the independent team that Sam has been gravitating toward since Book 6 (Chs. 110–111)
- **Zero's power-negation at range** - Zero can suppress metahuman abilities from a distance without physical contact, unlike Mr. Nothing who requires touch; his range, limitations, identity, and origin are unexplored; he remains active with Pattinson's Pals (Chs. 109–110, 117)
- **Sam's identity exposed to Patriot** - When her helmet breaks during the warehouse fight, Patriot recognizes Sam Small as Bloodhound; this knowledge is contained only by the threat of mutual assured destruction (the truce), not by secrecy (Ch. 118)
- **Abigail knows Sam's identity** - Sam's journalist cousin Abigail independently deduces that Sam is Bloodhound through investigative reasoning and promises to keep the secret; her knowledge as a journalist creates both protection and risk (Ch. 108)
- **The truce's fragility** - The Halloween truce rests on multiple bluffs: the "poison" is saline, Sam does not actually know DA Alvarez, and the evidence leverage is mutual rather than one-sided; Sam herself acknowledges that future conflicts with Patriot are inevitable (Ch. 118)
- **Pattinson's Pals expanding nationally** - Patriot mentions that "San Diego is already interested in our services" during a recorded conversation, indicating the organization is seeking to expand beyond Philadelphia into a national private security operation (Ch. 111)
- **Rogue Wave mind control** - Maya Richardson encounters people who become violent automatons when the phrase "Rogue Wave" is mentioned, suggesting a form of targeted psychic compulsion; the Kingdom is investigating but has no answers; the mechanism, scope, and controller are unknown (MR.1)
- **Kingdom's NSRA infiltration plan** - Maya proposes that the Kingdom offer its services to the NSRA as independent security consultants to gain an inside track on government operations; this has not yet been executed (MR.1)
- **Pop-Pop Moe's Daedalus involvement** - Moe's construction firm helped build the Daedalus Correctional Facility; he describes it as a different time and a mistake he's spent years trying to atone for; this creates a family legacy of complicity that parallels the institutional corruption Sam fights (Ch. 108)
- **Sam's activation event details** - Pop-Pop Moe reveals that Sam's powers first manifested on his boat, where she became a "snarling thing of the water" and tore the engine apart; Sam has no memory of this (Ch. 108)
- **Whistleblower website legal battle** - The site is taken down via injunction on cyberterrorism grounds; Jordan has backups and legal support but the site's future is uncertain; the active warrant for Jordan's arrest remains unresolved (Chs. 112–113)
- **Jordan's active warrant** - Patriot secures a warrant for Jordan's arrest on charges of cybercrimes, domestic terrorism, unlicensed use of superpowers, and petty theft; the warrant is technically still active even after Patriot's public disgrace (Chs. 112–113)
- **Illya's engineering work** - Fedorov designs portable radiation shielding at Aurora Springs, potentially creating technology with applications beyond his own containment (IF.5)
- **Egalitarian's power mechanics** - Egalitarian's vertigo power only affects non-powered individuals; powered individuals (Sam, Jordan) remain standing while everyone else is incapacitated; this suggests her ability targets a biological mechanism absent in metahumans (Ch. 112)
- **Congressional hearing outcomes** - Sam testifies alongside NSRA, PPD, DEA, and city officials; the hearing may lead to new legislation on superhuman oversight, but the political maneuvering suggests outcomes are uncertain; Sam advocates for independent oversight boards (Chs. 114–115)
- **Evelyn Shaw's confident smirk** - During her congressional testimony, Shaw develops an unexplained smug satisfaction despite being scapegoated, suggesting she knows something that will protect or advantage her (Ch. 114)

## Threads Progressed

- **Pattinson's Pals and Patriot as threats** (planted Book 6, Ch. 100) - The Pals escalate from background menace to the arc's primary antagonist, conducting "neighborhood safety patrols," deputizing civilians, and ultimately storming a school dance with police support; Sam confronts and neutralizes Patriot through intelligence and combat (Chs. 101–118)
- **Sam's whistleblower activism** (planted this arc, Ch. 105) - The website goes viral, attracts legal support and DDOS attacks, triggers Patriot's homecoming assault, is taken down via legal injunction, and becomes the catalyst for the full confrontation with Patriot's organization (Chs. 105–113)

- **Sam's identity management** (planted Book 1) - Sam's secret identity becomes increasingly precarious: Abigail deduces it independently (Ch. 108), Patriot discovers it when her helmet breaks (Ch. 118), and the congressional testimony requires federal agents to have her file on record (Ch. 114)
- **Sam's physical and psychological limits** (planted Book 4) - Sam sustains severe injuries from Patriot at homecoming (broken nose, cracked ribs, throat damage) and again at the warehouse (broken wrist, dislocated shoulder, cracked ribs); her old Deathgirl wound resurfaces without regeneration in Zero's field; she experiences a panic attack during congressional testimony (Chs. 109, 112, 115, 118)

## Threads Resolved

- **Fedorov's sentencing** - The question of where Illya would be incarcerated, raised during Book 6's verdict, is resolved: he receives fifty years at Aurora Springs Residential Facility, not Daedalus (planted Book 6 Ch. 100, resolved Ch. 107)
- **Pattinson's Pals' direct confrontation** - The simmering tension between Sam and Patriot's organization, building since Book 6, reaches resolution through two direct confrontations and a negotiated truce: Patriot stands down, leaves Jordan alone, and confines operations to South Philly in exchange for Sam withholding evidence (planted Book 6 Ch. 100, resolved Chs. 117–118)
- **Sam's congressional testimony** - The invitation from Book 6 is fulfilled: Sam travels to D.C. and testifies as Bloodhound before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee (planted Book 6 Ch. 100, resolved Chs. 114–115)
- **Playback's hidden bitterness** - Devonte's whispered "Don't trust these bitches" and his resignation in Book 6 are contextualized: he and Akilah have been conducting independent intelligence work, uncovering Project Titan and Egalitarian's Fly use, exactly the kind of work the official institutions failed to do (planted Book 6 Ch. 100, resolved Ch. 116)
