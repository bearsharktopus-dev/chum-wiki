## Summary

Book 7 opens on Sam Small's first day of sophomore year at Tacony Charter Academy, where heightened post-Chernobyl security measures have transformed the school into a pressure cooker. Racist security guard Officer Ridley assaults a Black freshman named James over a hat violation; Sam intervenes with an Aikido throw, earning a week of detention and the silent respect of many students. Sam and Jordan Westwood investigate the connection between the school's security guards and local law enforcement, trailing Officer Ridley to Patty's Bar, a cop hangout where they discover Patriot and Egalitarian among the regulars. The encounter crystallizes the arc's central conflict: the institutional alliance between police, private security, and Pattinson's Pals operating under the banner of public safety.

Sam, Jordan, Derek Taylor, and Connor Spindle launch an anonymous whistleblower website exposing misconduct by the school's security guards, which goes viral and attracts both legal support and DDOS attacks. Sam continues mentoring Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint), training her repulsion field abilities in an abandoned Tacony lot. The training session is interrupted by Zero, a power-negating member of Pattinson's Pals, who stalks and chases Sam and Maggie through the streets of Tacony with his followers. The pair escape to the Tacony Music Hall, Jordan's secret base, where they find Jordan, Spindle, and Tasha Reynolds already present. This crisis galvanizes the group into an organized resistance cell that will become the Auditors. Meanwhile, Sam's family gathers for Rosh Hashanah dinner, where Uncle Shelly drunkenly reveals that Pop-Pop Moe helped build the Daedalus Correctional Facility. During the Tashlich ceremony afterward, Abigail deduces that Sam is Bloodhound through investigative journalism and circumstantial evidence. Illya Fedorov is sentenced to fifty years at Aurora Springs Residential Facility.

The team spends weeks conducting surveillance on Patriot and his associates, gathering embarrassing and incriminating evidence through dumpster diving, directional microphone recordings, and Sam's blood-tracking abilities. Sam records Patriot discussing plans to push anti-superhuman legislation and create a private security empire. Jordan schedules the evidence dump to coincide with the homecoming dance, providing the team an alibi. The plan backfires spectacularly: Patriot, Egalitarian, and a squad of police officers storm the dance to arrest Jordan on cyberterrorism charges. Egalitarian deploys her vertigo-inducing power, incapacitating nearly everyone in the gymnasium except those with superpowers. Sam steps between Patriot and Jordan; Patriot beats her savagely in front of the entire school. A "Spartacus" moment erupts as students and teachers, led by Mr. Weston and Mike Giannopoulos, stagger to their feet and form a human shield. Jordan escapes. Sam is hospitalized.

Sam returns to school battered but unbroken. The whistleblower website is taken down via legal injunction. Mike Giannopoulos invites Sam to an upcoming protest. At a full Delaware Valley Defenders meeting, Sam announces her congressional testimony, scheduled since August. She travels to Washington, D.C. with her parents and federal escorts, donning her Bloodhound costume to testify before a Senate oversight committee on superhuman regulation. She observes testimony from NSRA Director Margaret Huang, Special Agent Evelyn Shaw, Commissioner Faraday, a DEA agent, Mayor Watkins, DA Carla Alvarez, and Dr. Emily Nakamura. Sam's own testimony focuses on the personal cost of being a teenage hero, the systemic failures that enable abuse, and the need for independent oversight. After her return, Devonte Harris and Akilah Washington visit with intelligence on Project Titan, a classified military program that attempted to create enhanced soldiers, identifying Patriot as an original test subject and war criminal. They also provide physical evidence of Egalitarian's Fly drug use. Sam confronts Patriot at a protest at Dilworth Park, engaging him in a philosophical exchange about power and ideology before arranging a private meeting.

The arc culminates on Halloween night in an abandoned warehouse at Penn Treaty Park. Sam arrives prepared with tripwires, a light killswitch (operated remotely by Tasha), pig blood spray, pepper spray, and a gauntlet rigged with syringes. The fight is brutal and sustained: Patriot breaks Sam's wrist, dislocates her shoulder, and cracks her ribs, while Sam breaks his nose twice via headbutts and bites his collarbone with her teeth. When Sam's helmet shatters, Patriot recognizes her as Sam Small. Sam injects him with what she claims is a slow-acting poison (actually saline) and negotiates a mutual non-aggression pact: Patriot stands down, leaves Jordan alone, and confines his operations to South Philadelphia, or Sam releases the evidence and Egalitarian's Fly use is exposed to DA Alvarez. Patriot reluctantly agrees. Sam leaves a first aid kit as a final gesture of mercy.

## Themes

- **Security as oppression** - The title operates on multiple levels: the "security" measures at Tacony Charter suppress students rather than protect them; Pattinson's Pals use "public safety" to justify harassment and intimidation; Patriot's private security ambitions are a vehicle for power rather than protection. The arc asks who is made secure and at whose expense.
- **Civilian activism vs. institutional power** - Sam and her friends fight back not with superpowers but with journalism, whistleblower websites, legal action, and congressional testimony. The arc positions information and truth-telling as more threatening to the power structure than any physical confrontation.
- **The making and unmaking of heroes** - Patriot's interlude reveals a man forged by abuse and institutional violence into a weapon who calls himself a hero. Sam's trajectory mirrors his in some respects (physical suffering, determination, a desperate need to prove worth), making the warehouse confrontation a battle between two people shaped by the same forces who chose different paths.
- **Family legacies and complicity** - Pop-Pop Moe's Daedalus involvement, Great-Grandpa Elijah's HUAC investigation, and Patriot's father's abuse all demonstrate how family history shapes present action. Sam inherits both the guilt of complicity and the imperative to resist.
- **Bluffing as survival** - Sam's victories in Book 7 come not through superior force but through deception: the saline "poison," the bluff about knowing DA Alvarez, the reverse-pickpocketing of Patriot. The arc frames cunning and psychological warfare as legitimate tools for the outmatched.

## Threads Planted

- **Project Titan** - Devonte and Akilah reveal the existence of a classified military program that attempted to create enhanced soldiers through artificial power induction; Patriot is identified as an original test subject; the full scope, other participants, and who authorized it remain unknown (Ch. 116)
- **Egalitarian's Fly use** - Physical evidence (dried blood containing Fly traces) proves Egalitarian is using the superpower-granting drug; this information is used as leverage against Patriot but has not been publicly released; its wider implications for Pattinson's Pals' credibility are unexplored (Chs. 116–118)
- **The Auditors' formation** - The proto-team assembles at the Tacony Music Hall: Sam, Jordan, Tasha, Spindle, Derek, and Maggie; Jordan names them "Auditors" and establishes the team dynamic; this represents the nucleus of the independent team that Sam has been gravitating toward since Book 6 (Chs. 110–111)
- **Zero's power-negation at range** - Zero can suppress metahuman abilities from a distance without physical contact, unlike Mr. Nothing who requires touch; his range, limitations, identity, and origin are unexplored; he remains active with Pattinson's Pals (Chs. 109–110, 117)
- **Sam's identity exposed to Patriot** - When her helmet breaks during the warehouse fight, Patriot recognizes Sam Small as Bloodhound; this knowledge is contained only by the threat of mutual assured destruction (the truce), not by secrecy (Ch. 118)
- **Abigail knows Sam's identity** - Sam's journalist cousin Abigail independently deduces that Sam is Bloodhound through investigative reasoning and promises to keep the secret; her knowledge as a journalist creates both protection and risk (Ch. 108)
- **The truce's fragility** - The Halloween truce rests on multiple bluffs: the "poison" is saline, Sam does not actually know DA Alvarez, and the evidence leverage is mutual rather than one-sided; Sam herself acknowledges that future conflicts with Patriot are inevitable (Ch. 118)
- **Pattinson's Pals expanding nationally** - Patriot mentions that "San Diego is already interested in our services" during a recorded conversation, indicating the organization is seeking to expand beyond Philadelphia into a national private security operation (Ch. 111)
- **Rogue Wave mind control** - Maya Richardson encounters people who become violent automatons when the phrase "Rogue Wave" is mentioned, suggesting a form of targeted psychic compulsion; the Kingdom is investigating but has no answers; the mechanism, scope, and controller are unknown (MR.1)
- **Kingdom's NSRA infiltration plan** - Maya proposes that the Kingdom offer its services to the NSRA as independent security consultants to gain an inside track on government operations; this has not yet been executed (MR.1)
- **Pop-Pop Moe's Daedalus involvement** - Moe's construction firm helped build the Daedalus Correctional Facility; he describes it as a different time and a mistake he's spent years trying to atone for; this creates a family legacy of complicity that parallels the institutional corruption Sam fights (Ch. 108)
- **Sam's activation event details** - Pop-Pop Moe reveals that Sam's powers first manifested on his boat, where she became a "snarling thing of the water" and tore the engine apart; Sam has no memory of this (Ch. 108)
- **Whistleblower website legal battle** - The site is taken down via injunction on cyberterrorism grounds; Jordan has backups and legal support but the site's future is uncertain; the active warrant for Jordan's arrest remains unresolved (Chs. 112–113)
- **Jordan's active warrant** - Patriot secures a warrant for Jordan's arrest on charges of cybercrimes, domestic terrorism, unlicensed use of superpowers, and petty theft; the warrant is technically still active even after Patriot's public disgrace (Chs. 112–113)
- **Illya's engineering work** - Fedorov designs portable radiation shielding at Aurora Springs, potentially creating technology with applications beyond his own containment (IF.5)
- **Egalitarian's power mechanics** - Egalitarian's vertigo power only affects non-powered individuals; powered individuals (Sam, Jordan) remain standing while everyone else is incapacitated; this suggests her ability targets a biological mechanism absent in metahumans (Ch. 112)
- **Congressional hearing outcomes** - Sam testifies alongside NSRA, PPD, DEA, and city officials; the hearing may lead to new legislation on superhuman oversight, but the political maneuvering suggests outcomes are uncertain; Sam advocates for independent oversight boards (Chs. 114–115)
- **Evelyn Shaw's confident smirk** - During her congressional testimony, Shaw develops an unexplained smug satisfaction despite being scapegoated, suggesting she knows something that will protect or advantage her (Ch. 114)

## Threads Progressed

- **Sam's congressional testimony** (planted Book 6, Ch. 100) - The invitation from Book 6 is fulfilled as Sam travels to D.C. and testifies before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee about her experiences, the NSRA's failures, and the need for superhuman oversight reform (Chs. 113–115)
- **Illya Fedorov's sentencing and incarceration** (planted Book 6, Ch. 100) - Fedorov is sentenced to fifty years at Aurora Springs (not Daedalus); in his interlude, he settles into the facility, reconnects with his wife Olena and daughter Yulia, and finds purpose in engineering work (Chs. 107, IF.5)
- **Illya's family** (planted Book 6, IF.4) - The thread of Illya's daughter is expanded: she is named Yulia, lives in Kyiv with her mother Olena; they visit Illya through lead glass at Aurora Springs; the family is reconnecting (IF.5)
- **Pattinson's Pals and Patriot as threats** (planted Book 6, Ch. 100) - The Pals escalate from background menace to the arc's primary antagonist, conducting "neighborhood safety patrols," deputizing civilians, and ultimately storming a school dance with police support; Sam confronts and neutralizes Patriot through intelligence and combat (Chs. 101–118)
- **Sam's whistleblower activism** (planted this arc, Ch. 105) - The website goes viral, attracts legal support and DDOS attacks, triggers Patriot's homecoming assault, is taken down via legal injunction, and becomes the catalyst for the full confrontation with Patriot's organization (Chs. 105–113)
- **Jump/Fly drug crisis** (planted Book 5, Ch. 73) - The crisis continues in the background; DEA Agent Turner testifies about its national scope; Egalitarian is revealed to be a Fly user herself, making the anti-superhuman crusaders hypocrites; Sam describes Fly blood as "fizzy" and "fluorescent orange" during her testimony (Chs. 114–116)
- **Kingdom of Keys operations** (planted Book 2) - Maya Richardson investigates Rogue Wave while managing Kingdom business; she encounters the mind-control trigger; Mr. Nothing and Mr. Mudslide are active; Mr. Camcorder provides CCTV surveillance; the Kingdom is positioning itself to exploit the chaos of the Chernobyl trial aftermath (MR.1)
- **Young Defenders team status** (planted Book 6, Ch. 100) - The reduced team (Rampart, Gossamer, Blink, Spindle, Bloodhound) continues operating under Rampart's cautious leadership; Rampart orders stand-down regarding the Pals; Sam grows increasingly frustrated with the institutional approach, pushing her further toward the independent Auditors (Chs. 106, 109, 113)

## Threads Resolved

- **Fedorov's sentencing** - The question of where Illya would be incarcerated, raised during Book 6's verdict, is resolved: he receives fifty years at Aurora Springs Residential Facility, not Daedalus (planted Book 6 Ch. 100, resolved Ch. 107)
- **Pattinson's Pals' direct confrontation** - The simmering tension between Sam and Patriot's organization, building since Book 6, reaches resolution through two direct confrontations and a negotiated truce: Patriot stands down, leaves Jordan alone, and confines operations to South Philly in exchange for Sam withholding evidence (planted Book 6 Ch. 100, resolved Chs. 117–118)
- **Sam's congressional testimony** - The invitation from Book 6 is fulfilled: Sam travels to D.C. and testifies as Bloodhound before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee (planted Book 6 Ch. 100, resolved Chs. 114–115)
- **Playback's hidden bitterness** - Devonte's whispered "Don't trust these bitches" and his resignation in Book 6 are contextualized: he and Akilah have been conducting independent intelligence work at Chambers & Woo Investigations, uncovering Project Titan and Egalitarian's Fly use, exactly the kind of work the official institutions failed to do (planted Book 6 Ch. 100, resolved Ch. 116)
