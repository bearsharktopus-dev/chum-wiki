## Summary

Book 12 opens three weeks after Kate's departure, with Sam adjusting to sole leadership of the Auditors. She's training with Multiplex at DVD headquarters — landing a hit on the electromagnetic Captain Plasma through strategic misdirection — and teaching boxing to her remaining team at the Music Hall, but Hypeman withdrawal episodes (headaches, tremors, alleviated only by cigarettes) are worsening. Amelia presents a new self-repairing costume with designated weak points for Sam's teeth, and the team transitions to intelligence-driven operations: civilian reconnaissance patrols, informant recruitment, and methodical evidence gathering.

The arc's first major thread follows the Auditors' investigation of a Jump distribution point at an abandoned Sunoco station on Longshore Avenue. A new informant named Darius tips them off; the team discovers active utilities and security cameras behind a shell company ("Horizon Development Group LLC"); and Sundial's psychometry confirms drug transactions. A night infiltration goes wrong when Marathon and his crew return, trapping Sam. She's captured by Dead Drop — a ferrokinetic enforcer who suspends her with metal chains — but the team extracts her through coordinated action: Blink's slingshot covering fire, Gossamer's secretly trained bullwhip, and Flashpoint's force fields. Rush Order arrives on motorcycle to extract Dead Drop, abandoning Marathon's crew. The team escapes with evidence before police arrive. That same morning, Rogue Wave hijacks a news broadcast to recruit a "mad scientist's assistant" for Snake Oil.

Interlude LS.2 reveals the recruitment process from the inside: Monkey Business and Snake Oil interview seventeen scavenger-hunt survivors at a Toyota dealership back office, rejecting institutionalized thinkers and mercenaries. Two candidates stand out — Pyrausta (Aurora Reyes, a self-taught fire chemist with a flame tulpa named Espada who has reverse-engineered Jump) and Chimera (Elias Franklin, a wheelchair-using biochemist and Fly user from the Philly Phreaks). Snake Oil also floats a potential collaboration with Dr. Necrosis, a German bioterrorist hiding in Chicago.

The political front escalates when Sundial warns Sam about Patriot's "Safer Streets Initiative" — a $500 bounty for reporting powered youth, announced on Fox News. Sam meets Bulldozer (Sean McNulty, the new leader of Pattinson's Pals) at Patty's Bar in South Philly to present evidence of Richardson's Kingdom connections. Bulldozer agrees to investigate independently. Meanwhile, Richardson visits Rachel Small at the library with thinly veiled threats about "extracurricular activities" and budget cuts. Rachel stands her ground and decides to testify against the anti-vigilante legislation in Harrisburg. Interlude RJ.1 shows Patriot receiving Bulldozer's intelligence, confronting Richardson at City Hall (where she provides plausible denials but triggers his suspicions through behavioral inconsistencies), and briefing his Argus Corps team — where Miasma privately warns him to be careful.

The arc's climax arrives when Rogue Wave hijacks the emergency alert system for a citywide Jump "scavenger hunt," throwing Philadelphia into chaos. Sam tracks Elias Franklin through the streets using Derek Taylor's blood sample, discovering a research station where Elias is testing Jump formulations in the field for Rogue Wave. Elias transforms into a snow leopard/vulture hybrid and escapes. Rush Order then ambushes Sam in a deliberately staged public fight designed as propaganda — crowds record as he systematically outmatches her. Sam's father Ben arrives, having tracked her via family sharing app, and confronts Rush Order with a handgun. Both men are wounded in the exchange of gunfire. "Gun Dad" goes viral.

Sam recovers at Jefferson Hospital with three cracked ribs and a sprained wrist while Ben undergoes surgery. Rachel extracts a promise from Sam to suspend Bloodhound activities during recovery. Interlude RS/DC/JF provides three perspectives: Rachel organizing a parents' support group and installing motion sensors on Sam's windows; Rush Order recovering in a Camden safehouse and confirming the fight was staged propaganda; and Jamila Fayad in Chicago, now operating as "Zephyr" in the Powered Youth Initiative, obsessively watching Sam's beating and debating whether to reach out. Gun sales spike 300%. Rush Order then releases a video declaring "Gun Dad" under Rogue Wave's protection — effectively painting a Kingdom target on Ben.

Sam breaks her promise and infiltrates Richardson's town hall at City Hall, confronting her in full Bloodhound costume with accusations about Richard Duvall's death and the T-Rex attack on the Small home. Richardson counters with a planted expert and sympathetic rhetoric, turning the crowd against Sam — until Rachel stands, identifies herself as "Gun Dad's wife," and reveals dozens of organized parents throughout the audience with protest signs reading "PROTECT POWERED YOUTH." The parent coalition catches Richardson off guard as it trends nationally with 20,000 signatures within hours. Captain Devil of Argus Corps intercepts Sam — revealing invisible talons, acidic blood, and four distinct powers — but she escapes via Flashpoint's force fields, a second-story window jump, and Blink's scooter extraction. At home, Sam's parents accept they cannot stop her from being Bloodhound but impose new boundaries: a tracker, library volunteering, and mandatory mission notifications.

Intermission VB.2 introduces Victor Blanc, Sam's estranged 72-year-old maternal grandfather, a long-haul trucker on I-81 in Virginia who receives mysterious texts about a granddaughter he didn't know existed. He decides to visit Philadelphia out of clinical curiosity rather than sentiment — someone with significant resources is deliberately bringing him into Sam's life.

|---|------|---------|
| 178 | 178.txt | Three weeks after Kate's departure. Sam spars with Captain Plasma at DVD HQ — exploits his electromagnetic field by feigning a gunshot wound bleed, forcing him to drop his shield, then lands a tooth-knuckle punch. Plasma departs for New York (Kingdom-related, classified). Sam teaches boxing to Maggie and Tasha at the Music Hall, assuming leadership role. Withdrawal symptoms: headaches, hand tremors. Aaron McKinley sentenced to 38 years at Daedalus. |

Regroup at Wawa in civilian clothes. Tasha identifies Rush Order and Dead Drop from the May broadcast as core Rogue Wave. Rogue Wave hijacks news: "Who wants to be a mad scientist's assistant?" |
| 183 | 183.txt | Same day, morning to late afternoon. Team watches Rogue Wave's recruitment broadcast — three meeting locations, candidates must carry Milton Friedman or Ayn Rand books. Sam sleeps nine hours, dreams of Liberty Belle and unfamiliar grandfather figure in endless concrete hallway with filing cabinets. Tasha tracks recruitment through HIRC and forums. Blink gathers intel from her family's police-frequented restaurant. Five finalists disappeared at One Liberty Place, likely bound by supernatural contracts. Team debates next moves: Kingdom, Argus Corps, Rogue Wave, regular crime. |
| LS.2 | ls-2.txt | INTERLUDE — Monkey Business and Snake Oil POV. Seventeen candidates at Toyota dealership back office. Reject Melvin Broderick (too institutionalized), Jennifer Walsh/Blackout (mercenary), David Kim (suspicious military background), Dr. Rebecca Foster (ethics questions).

Sam takes subway to South Philly, hyperaware of surveillance. |
| 185 | 185.txt | Same Saturday afternoon. Sam arrives at Patty's Bar on Wolf and 11th Street — entire bar falls silent "spaghetti western style." Bulldozer (Sean McNulty) gives her thirty seconds. Private back room: Sam accuses Richardson of Kingdom connections, cites Mrs. Z accompanying Mr. T-Rex in attack on Small house, legal connections via Tremont & Fairfax. Bulldozer skeptical but agrees to investigate independently and confront Patriot. Maintains public facade of animosity. "Complicated. As usual." |

Rogue Wave hijacks emergency alert system: citywide Jump "scavenger hunt" with "contractors" ordered to interfere with police and Argus Corps. Chaos erupts. Derek must cage himself before sunset (8:20 PM werewolf transformation). |
| 187 | 187.txt | Same evening, ~8–10 PM. Sam changes into Bloodhound costume; sends reassuring lies to parents. Tracks Elias's distinctive orange-tinged blood through South Philly — methodical, purposeful path. Intervenes in Jump chaos: bodega fight, glowing-blue-hands woman, injured teenagers. Encounters Bulldozer and Parabellum. Follows trail to five-story storage facility: maps, notebooks with scientific data, surveillance equipment. Confronts Elias — he's testing Jump formulations for Rogue Wave, motivated by anarchist philosophy and medical trauma, promised lifetime Fly supply. "Genesis Births should've been greatest paradigm shift in human history." Elias transforms (snow leopard, vulture, other animals) and escapes across rooftops. Rush Order tackles Sam — "backup's here." |
| 188 | 188.txt | Same evening, ~9–10:30 PM. Rush Order ambushes Sam on South Street — theatrical, drawing crowd with recording devices and drones. Deliberate propaganda spectacle. Sam analyzes movement patterns via Multiplex training, identifies "tell" (must plant feet before accelerating). Systematically outmatched. Rush Order reveals ideology: "The system's broken, and we're tearing it down." Tells Sam to "stay in Tacony." Herds her back when she tries to flee. Ben Small arrives via family sharing app with handgun. Standoff, exchange of gunfire — both men wounded. Rush Order retreats with mangled shoulder. Bystanders (nurse, Mike in Eagles cap) provide first aid. Mike drives Sam and Ben to Jefferson Hospital. Emergency department overwhelmed with Jump casualties. Sam calls Rachel. "She's going to kill us both, isn't she?" |
| 189 | 189.txt | Night of July 25 through morning July 26. Jefferson Hospital. Sam: three cracked ribs, sprained wrist, reveals accelerated healing to medical staff. Ben in surgery for gunshot wound. Rachel arrives — reporters gathering, video trending, social media dubs Ben "Gun DILF." Pop-pop Moe escorted by police after speeding to hospital.

| 190 | 190.txt | ~August 8–15. Two weeks of recovery under Rachel's watch. Tasha transforms Sam's bedroom into command center. Team continues limited surveillance: Rogue Wave expanding, Kingdom enforcers in suits, Argus Corps guarding armored transports. Bulldozer gone silent. Rush Order releases video declaring "Gun Dad" under Rogue Wave protection — Sam and Tasha recognize this paints Kingdom target on Ben. Sam resumes limited training with Multiplex (60% capacity). Amelia reinforces suit for healing ribs. Team scouts City Hall for Richardson's upcoming town hall. Rachel forbids Sam from attending. Sam triggers motion sensor deliberately, meets Lily with scooter at predetermined location. Captain Devil spotted on City Hall roof. |
| 191 | 191.txt | Evening, August 15. Sam enters town hall in Bloodhound costume through center aisle. Accuses Richardson of connection to Duvall's death (Checkers cashier testimony) and T-Rex attack on Small house (eyewitness). Richardson counters: planted Dr. Chambers cites neurological development against youth vigilantism; crowd turns against Sam. Security ordered to remove her. Rachel stands — identifies herself as "Gun Dad's wife," announces she is "the parent of a powered teen." Dozens of parents rise with protest signs: "PROTECT POWERED YOUTH," "MY CHILD IS NOT A WEAPON." Rachel announces September state hearing testimony. Richardson orders room cleared. Captain Devil intercepts Sam — invisible extendable talons, acidic blood, four distinct powers. Sam sprays diluted pig's blood to track invisible talons; cannot use teeth due to acid blood. Signals Lily for extraction. Slides under Captain Devil's attack, slips free of boot caught by talons. |
| 192 | 192.txt | Same evening, continuing. Sam flees through City Hall corridors one-booted. Cornered in stairwell — Captain Devil's invisible talons gouge marble floors. Maggie arrives with force fields, knocks Devil off balance. Sam jumps from second-story window onto awning; Maggie follows using force fields. Devil chooses not to pursue in public. Lily extracts on Amelia's scooter. Music Hall debrief: town hall footage trending nationally; Rachel's "Parents of Powered Kids" coalition launched website, 20,000 signatures in hours, chapters across Pennsylvania spreading to neighboring states. Councilman Davis texts: "Nice work tonight. -JD." Family confrontation: Rachel confirms she knew Sam would break promise (motion sensors tracked departure, not prevented it). Punishment: library volunteering five days/week, Ben's physical therapy help, tracker at all times, mission notification required. Parents express grudging pride. Coalition gaining national momentum. |
| VB.2 | vb-2.txt | INTERMISSION — Victor Blanc POV. 3:17 AM, I-81 in Virginia. 72-year-old long-haul trucker with cats Box and Coal. Reflects on 1989 dock-worker violence, revealing calculating nature. Mysterious texts (3:20–4:22 AM): unknown person mentions "family in Philadelphia," granddaughter Samantha — Victor learns she exists for the first time. Struggles to remember Ben Small's name. Decides to visit out of clinical curiosity, not sentiment. Recalls Rachel's wedding (felt "nothing," got into a fistfight, drank at the edges). Contacts dispatcher Maeve — mysterious person already arranged time off. Delivers to Harrisonburg depot. Feels unusual anticipation, acknowledges this as "very weird." Someone with significant resources is engineering this reunion. |

## Themes

- **Leadership without a safety net** — Sam loses every person who previously shared the weight: Jordan at MIT, Kate in hiding, Captain Plasma departing for New York. What remains is a team of teenagers who look to her for training, strategy, and courage she doesn't fully possess. She teaches boxing techniques she learned weeks ago. She runs intelligence operations modeled on spy movies and TV cop procedurals. She builds an informant network out of a stranger in a park. The arc's central question is whether competence born from desperation can substitute for experience — and the answer, terrifyingly, is "sometimes."

- **The family as political unit** — The Small family transforms from bystanders to active combatants on multiple fronts: Sam fights in costume, Ben fights with a gun, Rachel fights with a coalition and testimony. Richardson's mistake is threatening Rachel at her library — the intimidation that was meant to isolate instead galvanizes. When Rachel stands in the town hall audience and identifies herself as "the parent of a powered teen," she weaponizes the one thing Richardson's legislation cannot account for: a mother willing to go public. The arc argues that families are not collateral damage but infrastructure.

- **Propaganda and spectacle** — Every faction now fights on camera. Rush Order stages his fight with Sam for drones and phones, calculating media impact. Rogue Wave's recruitment is performance art. Richardson hosts town halls that double as legislative theater. The parent coalition launches a website that goes viral. "Gun Dad" becomes a cultural symbol overnight. Even Sam's town hall entrance — walking down the center aisle in full Bloodhound costume — is calculated spectacle. The war for Philadelphia is increasingly a war for narrative.

- **Institutional mirroring** — Each faction builds parallel infrastructure: Sam runs an intelligence operation with informants, surveillance, and psychometric confirmation; Monkey Business conducts formal job interviews with technical assessments and cultural-fit evaluations; Richardson deploys bounty systems, planted experts, and coordinated town halls; Patriot maintains a paramilitary hierarchy with research assignments and team briefings. All four organizations are becoming more sophisticated versions of the same thing — institutions competing to define legitimate power.

- **The cost of curiosity** — Elias Franklin became a Rogue Wave operative because he asked "what if Genesis Births could be democratized?" Rush Order stages fights because he believes "the system's broken and we're tearing it down." Even Victor Blanc's decision to visit Philadelphia stems from clinical curiosity about inherited temperament. The arc's villains are not stupid or evil but dangerously curious — people who followed interesting questions to monstrous conclusions. Sam's own curiosity drives her to investigate, infiltrate, and confront, and the bill comes due in cracked ribs and a father in surgery.

## Threads Planted

- **Gossamer's hidden combat abilities** — Amelia reveals trained bullwhip expertise during the Sunoco escape, having secretly developed combat skills beyond her textile powers; her "microscope breaker" abilities and self-repairing costume design suggest untapped potential (Ch. 182)
- **Dead Drop as recurring threat** — Professional Rogue Wave enforcer with ferrokinesis strong enough to choke Sam with chains from a distance; survived initial confrontation and escaped with Rush Order; operational methodology (restraint, debate over killing, tactical retreat) marks her as more dangerous than street-level villains (Chs. 181–182)
- **Rush Order's propaganda methodology** — Stages fights specifically for camera, calculates media impact, releases strategic videos; "Gun Dad protection" video demonstrates ability to weaponize public attention against rivals; treats combat as content creation (Chs. 188, 190, RS/DC/JF)
- **Pyrausta / Aurora Reyes** — Self-taught fire chemist who reverse-engineered Jump, controls flame tulpa "Espada," and discovered that Snake Oil's crystals produce anomalous effects when burned; recruited to work with Snake Oil (LS.2)
- **Chimera / Elias Franklin as Rogue Wave field operative** — Wheelchair-using biochemist testing Jump formulations in the field; motivated by anarchist ideology and lifetime Fly supply; maintains research station with scientific data; can transform into animal hybrids (snow leopard/vulture); first detailed appearance after Book 11 disappearance reference (LS.2, Chs. 187)
- **Dr. Necrosis** — German bioterrorist hiding in Chicago; Snake Oil suggests collaboration for viral vectors; Monkey Business notes ideological incompatibility with profit-based model (LS.2)
- **Patriot's doubts about Richardson** — Notes behavioral inconsistencies during City Hall confrontation (she never addresses the weather during the T-Rex attack); Miasma privately warns him; quietly begins investigation while maintaining public loyalty to Argus Corps (RJ.1)
- **Captain Devil's four powers** — Invisible extendable talons, acidic blood (prevents Sam's teeth attacks), and two unrevealed additional powers; measured pursuit style suggests tactical thinking (Chs. 191–192)
- **"Gun Dad" as cultural phenomenon** — Ben's intervention goes viral; gun sales spike 300%; Rush Order co-opts the image for Rogue Wave propaganda; the icon becomes a battlefield between factions claiming its meaning (Chs. 188–189, RS/DC/JF)
- **Rachel's "Parents of Powered Kids" coalition** — National movement with 20,000 signatures in hours, chapters across Pennsylvania spreading to neighboring states; creates organized political opposition to anti-vigilante legislation; Rachel evolves from concerned parent to movement leader (RS.3, Chs. 191–192, RS/DC/JF)
- **Victor Blanc being engineered into Sam's life** — Unknown texter with significant resources arranged time off through his dispatcher and knows about Sam; Victor's emotional detachment, calculating nature, and history of violence contrast sharply with the Small family's warmth (VB.2)
- **Sam's Liberty Belle dream** — Strange dream of Liberty Belle and unfamiliar grandfather figure in endless concrete hallway with filing cabinets; possible foreshadowing of Victor Blanc or deeper power connection (Ch. 183)
