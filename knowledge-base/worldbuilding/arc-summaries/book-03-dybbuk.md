## Summary

After losing her home, Sam moves into Lily Chen's Bridesburg rowhouse, adjusts to a new family's rhythms, and visits Puppeteer at an inpatient psychiatric facility. Puppeteer reveals her Narcissistic Personality Disorder diagnosis, apologizes for assaulting Sam, and accepts that the condition bars her from Registered Superhuman Entity status. Leadership of the Young Defenders remains with Crossroads.

The Young Defenders are dispatched to South Street to confront the Philly Phreaks, a gang of visually-apparent metahuman teenagers whose behavior has grown aggressive under Kingdom influence. The fight reveals the Phreaks' secret weapon: Daisy Zhen (Deathgirl), a twelve-year-old with anger-based power-copying abilities who was "gifted" to the Phreaks by the Kingdom. She copies and amplifies every hero's powers before escaping through a storm drain. Spindle betrays the Phreaks to help the Young Defenders capture Patches, who in custody confirms the Kingdom's involvement. Meanwhile, Belle returns to the team gaunt and bald from chemotherapy, revealing that her cancer has spread to her lungs, liver, and bones, leaving her eight to twenty-four months.

Belle uses her remaining time to train Sam in combat, tradecraft, surveillance, and deception. Sam begins dating Jamila after an emotional confession in Jamila's Germantown bedroom, attends a Demon Core metal concert in Camden where she defends Jamila from a racist attacker, visits Kate's basketball scrimmage at Abraham Lincoln High School, and returns to Tacony Academy where classmates treat her as the "school badass." On Halloween night, Sam, Jordan, Jamila, and Spinelli infiltrate a Kingdom warehouse on Trenton Avenue, witnessing Mr. Polygraph execute an informant and instruct roughly thirty recruits to convert stolen goods into twenty thousand dollars each. The team narrowly escapes when Mudslide confronts them at the exit, with Spindle staying behind as a diversion and returning at dawn. They present the evidence - including video footage and Jordan's research into Kingdom shell companies like Orion Holdings, Cerulean Dynamics, and Lockhart & Greene - to Belle, Davis, and Clara, who agree to pursue the intelligence through parallel construction.

In the arc's final movement, Sam secretly follows Belle across Philadelphia using her blood sense to track Belle's bleeding ulcers. She discovers Belle setting up surveillance at the abandoned PES refinery - where Professor Franklin was killed and where Belle nearly died. Belle confronts Sam at a pier, reveals the refinery is where she expects Chernobyl to return, and forbids Sam from getting involved. On the first night of Hanukkah, emergency pagers signal Chernobyl's arrival. Sam disobeys orders and follows Belle to the refinery, recording a confrontation in which Chernobyl reveals his arrangement with the federal government to provide energy in exchange for freedom. He accuses Belle of being haunted by a "dybbuk" - the spirit of Professor Franklin driving her to suicidal vengeance. Despite Belle's ferocity, Chernobyl's mechanized suit proves overwhelming. Sam intervenes with a spear fashioned by chewing a pipe to a point, puncturing the suit and drawing Chernobyl's unusual white blood, but she cannot change the outcome. Chernobyl drives a spike through Belle's chest, killing her. Sam cradles Belle as she dies. The arc closes with heroes gathering at DVD headquarters to mourn.

## Themes

- **The dybbuk - inherited grief as possession** - The arc's title invokes the Jewish folklore of a possessing spirit. Chernobyl explicitly accuses Belle of being haunted by Franklin's ghost, driven to suicidal vengeance rather than rational heroism. The parallel structure - Franklin dies, Belle pursues his killer and dies, Sam will pursue Belle's killer - frames mentorship's dark side: the dead impose their unfinished missions on the living.
- **The cost of loyalty** - Sam's defining trait is her refusal to abandon people she cares about, even when ordered to stand down. She follows Belle despite explicit prohibition. She stays at the refinery when fleeing would save her life. Loyalty here is not a virtue rewarded but a compulsion that places her at the epicenter of trauma.
- **Coming of age under fire** - Sam juggles first love, school reintegration, family displacement, and intensifying hero work. The arc traces her transition from reactive street fighter to trained investigator, but each new skill comes freighted with the knowledge that Belle is teaching it because she is dying.
- **Institutional violence against the marginal** - The Philly Phreaks are visually-apparent metahuman teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds, weaponized by the Kingdom and sent against other teenagers for optics reasons. Chernobyl is a trapped man used as a government energy source. Pop-Pop Moe regrets building Daedalus, a prison for people with powers. The systems designed to manage superhumans consistently exploit the most vulnerable.
- **Normalcy as illusion** - Sam's attempts to maintain ordinary life - Thanksgiving dinner, school friendships, basketball games, a first date - are repeatedly interrupted by emergencies, violence, and death. The arc asks whether a powered teenager can inhabit both worlds or must choose.

## Threads Planted

- **Chernobyl's government energy deal** - During the refinery confrontation, Chernobyl reveals he has an arrangement with the federal government to provide energy to power substations in exchange for freedom. Sam records this confession on her phone (Ch. 44).
- **Sam's recording of Belle's death** - Sam films the entire refinery confrontation on her phone, including Chernobyl's admissions and Belle's final battle. Belle notices the camera and silently encourages Sam to keep recording. This footage becomes critical evidence (Chs. 44–45).

- **Puppeteer's NPD and RSE restriction** - Akilah's Narcissistic Personality Disorder diagnosis permanently bars her from Registered Superhuman Entity status, though she can still work as a licensed vigilante (Ch. 31).
- **Kate's growing distance and hidden intensity** - Sam visits Kate's basketball game and feels the strain of keeping secrets from her oldest friend. Kate notices Sam's physical changes and asks about her "afterschool activities" (Ch. 38).
- **Jamila's father's untranslated comment** - When he learns Sam is Jewish, Jamila's father makes a remark in Arabic that angers Jamila, who refuses to translate it, introducing cultural and religious tension (Ch. 35).
- **Aurora Springs as containment option** - Belle mentions Aurora Springs as a facility Chernobyl rejected in favor of freedom; she promises to explain it to Sam later but dies before she can (Ch. 37).
- **Spindle's defection and integration** - Connor betrays the Phreaks, cooperates with authorities, enters witness protection, escapes from Sam's backpack, and asks to join Sam's team, beginning his transformation from gang member to hero (Chs. 33–34, 39).
- **Mr. Mudslide as Kingdom enforcer** - Mudslide confronts the team during their warehouse escape, now wearing professional attire with his paper bag mask, confirming his rise within the Kingdom hierarchy (Ch. 41).
- **Pop-Pop Moe's Daedalus regret** - The Morris Small interview reveals that Pop-Pop Moe co-founded Horvath-Small Ltd. and deeply regrets his firm's role in building Daedalus Correctional Facility, worrying about what his grandchildren will think (interlude).
- **Belle's letter and detective bequest** - Belle's will leaves Sam all her detective equipment and investigative files, including a notebook on Chernobyl, positioning Sam as her investigative successor (set up by Belle's intensive training throughout the arc, paid off in Book 4).
