## Summary

Sam returns to active patrolling after months of hospitalization and recovery from radiation poisoning, operating out of the newly renovated Tacony Music Hall with Jordan. Their first night back, they encounter two members of the Tacony Titans — Sundial and Bubble — breaking up a drunken brawl in Wissinoming Park, establishing the existence of a parallel hero team operating in the Northeast. Sam adopts the "Big Bad Wolf" persona, complete with a wolf mask and cloak, and the pair rebrand themselves as "the Auditors" with a new operational philosophy of stealth over force. She celebrates Passover with her family and Jamila, briefly reflecting on the forbidden maternal grandfather and her newly discovered Hispanic heritage, before settling into an uneasy routine of patrols, school, and recovery that leaves her barely passing her classes by the end of the year.

When the Young Defenders respond to a villain incident involving Ricochet, Sam defies orders to observe from the sidelines and witnesses the Tacony Titans in full action — Sundial, Moonshot, Bubble, and Compass coordinating alongside the Defenders. Sam's blood sense detects that Ricochet's blood is "orange and carbonated," the first indication of the Jump and Fly drug crisis that will dominate the arc. After being told to stand down, Sam channels her frustration into community first aid, walking through neighborhoods and treating minor injuries with skills learned from Gossamer. At the Young Defenders' headquarters, Crossroads briefs Sam on two forms of power drugs: Jump (temporary green pills granting three hours of powers) and Fly (permanent injectable transformation with psychoactive side effects). Shortly after, Derek Taylor — a confrontational member of Sam's support group who secretly knows her identity — reveals that his friend Elias Franklin took Fly and transformed into a chimeric creature called Chimera. Sam and Derek confront Elias at an Independence Blue Cross office he is trashing; Elias provides the first physical description of a Fly distributor (bald, white, electrical powers) before escaping through a seventh-story window in deer form.

The Auditors expand to include Derek (as "Fenrir") and Spindle, and they launch a methodical investigation into the drug trade. Jordan identifies the mid-level dealer Squeal (Steven Praznik, sonic scream powers), and the team plans a sting at the Dobson Mills warehouse. Sam visits the Tacony Titans' garage headquarters and proposes a formal alliance, integrating the Titans into the operation. The sting is disrupted when Miss Mayfly — a masked non-powered vigilante Sam does not yet recognize — detonates stink bombs and smoke grenades inside the warehouse, blowing the surveillance. In the ensuing chaos, Squeal escapes and Sparkplug's enforcer nearly kills Jordan before Sam intervenes. Sam discovers that Miss Mayfly is Kate Smith, her childhood best friend, who has been secretly operating as a vigilante with a support team of their mutual school friends: Tasha Reynolds (Wasp, comms), Lilly Rodriguez (Moth, medical/chemical), Marcus Johnson (Mite, drones/engineering), and Jenna Nguyen (Ant, programming/surveillance). Sam grounds Kate from field operations and restricts Team Mayfly to reconnaissance and tech support, then convenes a tri-team meeting at the Music Hall to plan the takedown of Sparkplug.

The combined teams execute a multi-phase infiltration of Sparkplug's penthouse at the Dorchester high-rise. Jordan pickpockets and clones a key fob, Derek uses his enhanced scent to locate the unit, and the full alliance breaches while the Tacony Titans — with Sandman riding the werewolf Fenrir — handle the lobby and exits. Sam subdues Sparkplug with a Ketamine/Xylazine injector glove and he is turned over to authorities. During interrogation, Sparkplug reveals his connection to "Rogue Wave," an organization manufacturing and distributing Jump and Fly. In the aftermath, Kate steals a dose of Jump from the sting evidence, takes it, and confronts Sam at their childhood basketball court with temporary metal-skin powers. The fight exposes deep fractures: Kate accuses Sam of abandoning their friendship after gaining powers, of class betrayal for attending a charter school, and of hypocritically gatekeeping heroism while opposing the drugs that could equalize powerless people. Sam's teeth and claws shatter against Kate's metal exterior. Both collapse from exhaustion, reaching a fragile truce — Kate promises to stop vigilantism, but crosses her fingers behind her back.

## Themes

- **Power inequality and the ethics of gatekeeping** — Kate's argument that Sam hypocritically opposes power drugs while telling unpowered people they cannot be heroes strikes at the heart of the arc. The question of who "deserves" powers and whether the superhero community is a meritocracy built on accident rather than merit is never fully answered.
- **The cost of being left behind** — Multiple characters (Kate, Team Mayfly, Jordan, the Titans) built their own structures of resistance and purpose while Sam was hospitalized. The arc examines what happens to the people surrounding a hero when the hero is absent — they do not wait; they adapt, sometimes dangerously.
- **Coalition and trust** — The arc tracks the formation of a three-team alliance (Auditors, Titans, Mayfly) and the frictions inherent in multi-group coordination: differing philosophies, overlapping jurisdictions, communication failures, and the fundamental challenge of trusting strangers with your life.
- **Recovery as identity crisis** — Sam's return from near-death forces her to reconcile her weakened body with her reputation. She adopts a new persona (Big Bad Wolf), discovers her friends built lives without her, and faces the dissonance between who she was before Chernobyl and who she is becoming.
- **Class and economic inequality** — Kate's accusations about charter school attendance, college anxiety, and economic disparity between their families expose the material conditions underlying superheroism. The power-drug debate mirrors real debates about access and equity.

## Threads Planted

- **Rogue Wave organization** — Sparkplug names the organization behind Jump and Fly distribution during interrogation; their ideology (anarcho-capitalist, "leveling the playing field") and membership remain largely unknown (Ch. 85)
- **Elias Franklin / Chimera at large** — Derek's Fly-transformed friend escapes by shifting to deer form; his whereabouts are unknown; he described Sparkplug before fleeing; Derek's long-term mission to track him is established (Chs. 75–76)
- **Kate crosses her fingers** — Kate promises Sam she will stop vigilantism but crosses her fingers behind her back, signaling she has no intention of quitting (Ch. 85)
- **Kate's class resentment** — Kate's philosophical challenge about power inequality and who gets to be a hero is never answered by Sam; the argument exposes fractures that a single conversation cannot repair (Ch. 85)
- **Chernobyl's trial timeline** — Trial is set for August 15, 2024, creating a ticking clock; the necessity defense strategy and whether Sam will be called as a witness are unresolved (IF.3)
- **Mrs. Xenograft's interest in Fly** — At the Kingdom leadership meeting, Mrs. Xenograft displays scientific curiosity about Fly's mechanism, planting seeds for later Kingdom drug development (BM.1)
- **Kingdom response to the drug crisis** — Mrs. Zenith orders intelligence gathering on Fly; Mr. Tyrannosaur suggests eliminating or recruiting distributors; she mentions sending "M" (Mudslide) as backup, signaling escalation (BM.1)
- **Squeal's fate** — Steven Praznik escapes the warehouse sting; his GPS tracker stops transmitting near the Delaware River; status unknown — potentially dead, in hiding, or captured by Rogue Wave (Chs. 79, 81)
- **Sam's blood sense as drug detection** — Sam can identify Jump/Fly users by their "orange, carbonated" blood signature, making her an invaluable investigative asset for the broader drug crisis (Chs. 73, 75–76)
- **Sandman-Fenrir combat partnership** — Sandman rides and controls Derek's werewolf form in combat, creating a potent tactical combination; established one week before the Sparkplug raid (Ch. 84)
- **The Faraday cage room** — Built specifically for ESP protection; implies awareness of psychic threats not yet encountered in force (Ch. 70)
- **Sundial's interest in Crossroads** — Sundial makes flirtatious inquiries about Crossroads during the Ricochet aftermath, planting a potential interpersonal subplot bridging two teams (Ch. 73)
- **Team Mayfly's drone arsenal** — Sixteen coordinated drones with LIDAR, paint bombs, chemical payloads, and surveillance capability; restricted to recon but representing significant tactical infrastructure (MM.1, MM.2, Ch. 83)
- **Jamila's Hajj plans** — Jamila discusses pilgrimage plans with Sam at a cafe, suggesting physical and emotional distance ahead; combined with ongoing strain, foreshadows the eventual breakup (Ch. 85)
- **The "Mosquito" identity** — The Tacony Titans already encountered and disliked Miss Mayfly before Sam learned Kate's secret; Sundial's dismissive nickname reflects how established heroes view unpowered interlopers (Chs. 70, 73)
- **Derek's knowledge of Sam's identity** — Derek reveals he knows Sam is Bloodhound without explaining how he learned this; his enhanced sense of smell is implied but not confirmed as the method (Ch. 74)
- **Spindle's criminal contacts** — Spindle reconnects with former criminal associates for intelligence, including someone called "Deathgirl"; his willingness to participate in illegal activities for information creates moral ambiguity (Ch. 77)

## Threads Progressed

- **Sam's recovery and return to action** (planted Book 4, Ch. 62) — Sam returns to patrols but remains physically weakened from radiation; her muscles ache, she tires quickly, and she is not at peak performance; her regeneration works better under acute stress, creating a cruel incentive toward danger.
- **The Auditors team formation** (planted Book 4, Ch. 54) — The team expands from Sam-Jordan-Spindle to include Derek/Fenrir, and ultimately coordinates with two allied teams (Titans and Mayfly); the name "Auditors" is formally adopted on their first patrol.
- **Sam's mental health and medication** (planted Intermission 4.5, Ch. 64) — Sam continues on lithium; the emotional flatness it produces contrasts with the aliveness she feels during combat; the tension between medication stability and danger-seeking behavior persists throughout.
- **Sam and Jamila's relationship strain** (planted Intermission 4.5, Ch. 65) — Jamila participates in Passover, gives Sam a wind pendant for her birthday, but increasing distance is evident; the Hajj conversation in Chapter 85 signals physical separation ahead.
- **Sam's maternal grandfather mystery** (planted Intermission 4.5, Ch. 65) — Sam "briefly reflects" on the forbidden figure during Passover but gains no new information; the secrecy persists.
- **Sam's Hispanic heritage** (planted Intermission 4.5, Ch. 65) — Acknowledged through Passover context and Camilla's continued presence but not deeply explored this arc.
- **Kingdom of Keys operations** (planted Book 2) — The Kingdom discusses the Fly crisis at their South Philadelphia HQ; Mr. Polygraph was personally attacked by Fly users; Mrs. Zenith orders intelligence gathering, signaling the Kingdom's entry into the drug conflict.
- **Miasma's false charges** (planted Book 4, Ch. 56) — Sam continues following Joshua Pleasants' legal case; she previously asked the Young Defenders for help and has video evidence; no resolution this arc.
- **The Tacony Music Hall as base** (planted Intermission 4.5, Ch. 67) — The base receives significant upgrades (electricity, Faraday cage, medical clinic) and hosts the tri-team meeting; it transitions from a temporary hideout to a semi-permanent headquarters.
- **Jordan's surveillance tendencies** (planted Book 4, Ch. 55) — Jordan investigates Derek's home without authorization, finding cages in the basement; Sam expresses discomfort, continuing the ethical tension about Jordan doing morally gray work so Sam does not have to.
- **Sam's community first aid practice** (planted Intermission 4.5) — After being dismissed from the Ricochet fight, Sam walks home treating neighbors' minor injuries, applying Gossamer's training and developing a softer approach to heroism that foreshadows the later mentorship program.
- **The Dobson Mills warehouse** (planted Book 4) — The warehouse from Sam's first major battle returns as the site of the Squeal sting; Sam and Jordan reflect on previous trauma associated with the location; evidence of Mudslide's earlier presence remains.
- **Sam's "Big Bad Wolf" persona** (planted this arc, building on Bloodhound identity from Book 1) — Sam adopts a wolf mask and cloak, rebranding from Bloodhound to a more intimidating identity; her old gear is repurposed by Derek as "Fenrir."

## Threads Resolved

- **Kate's secret vigilante identity** — The mystery of Miss Mayfly is resolved when Sam discovers Kate injured after the warehouse disruption; Kate reveals she has been operating with their school friends throughout Sam's hospitalization (planted MM.1, resolved Ch. 81–82)
- **The "Mosquito" mystery** — Bubble's earlier reference to an annoying "mosquito" is revealed to be Miss Mayfly/Kate, whom the Tacony Titans had already encountered and dismissed (planted Ch. 70, resolved Ch. 73/81)
- **Jordan's absence and guilt** (planted Intermission 4.5, Ch. 66) — Fully resolved by this arc; Jordan and Sam are operating as seamless partners again, with Jordan having invested their college fund into the Music Hall
- **Crossroads' promise to share drug information** (planted Intermission 4.5, Ch. 73) — Crossroads delivers on his promise by briefing Sam on Jump and Fly at DVD headquarters (resolved Ch. 74)
- **Sparkplug's identity and capture** — The bald man with electrical powers described by Elias is identified, tracked through Squeal, located at the Dorchester, and captured by the tri-team alliance (planted Ch. 76, resolved Ch. 84)
