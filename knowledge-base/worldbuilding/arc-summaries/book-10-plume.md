## Summary

Book 10 opens in the aftermath of Aaron McKinley's arrest, with Sam still bandaged from burns as she gives deposition testimony about the confrontation. During the deposition she overhears that Aaron's defense is being funded by mysterious "concerned citizens for due process" through the high-powered law firm Tremont & Fairfax — a thread the Auditors will pull for the rest of the arc. At home, Sam's relationship with Kate Smith is tense but functional: they attend physical therapy together, compete on an obstacle course, and maintain a cold détente in which neither acknowledges the growing evidence that Kate is the chemical-smoke vigilante Soot. Meanwhile, Jordan introduces a police scanner and the team investigates a scene of pepper-sprayed drug dealers — their first hint that someone else is waging a street-level war on the Jump trade.

The arc's first major crisis arrives when the Kingdom of Keys ambushes the prison transport of Mr. Nothing and Mudslide. Interlude RG.1 follows Captain Plasma's POV as the elaborate convoy — multiple decoys, anti-ESP shielding, aerial surveillance — is systematically dismantled by Kingdom operatives: Mr. Tyrannosaur emerges on the turnpike, Mrs. Fulcrum flips vehicles with her power, Mr. Yellowjacket conducts precision attacks with pressurized air bursts, and Mrs. Jellyjam ultimately suffocates Plasma with a gelatinous substance. Interlude BM.2 then follows Mr. Tyrannosaur and the rescue team to a Kingdom-owned steakhouse in Lancaster, revealing organizational dynamics through banter — Yellowjacket runs the Baltimore branch, Jellyjam shows leadership instincts, Mudslide explains the symbolism of his paper-bag mask, and the Kingdom's money-laundering infrastructure is laid bare. Back in Sam's timeline, she monitors the transport's collapse via scanner, then publicly confronts Maya Richardson at a school assembly about Richard Duvall's death and Kingdom connections, going viral on NetSphere.

The political landscape shifts dramatically when Councilman Ward and Richardson introduce the Superhuman Activity Regulation Act, banning vigilante activities for individuals under 18 regardless of LUMA status. The legislation passes 12-5, and the Young Defenders are formally dissolved — Gossamer leaves superhero work, Connor departs for civilian life, Rampart joins the DVDs officially, while Sam and Blink refuse to quit. The team reorganizes as "The Auditors," with Amelia and Lily formally joining, operating from the Tacony Music Hall. Interlude So.1 provides Soot's POV for the first time: a calculated vigilante who infiltrates dealer gatherings, trades stolen drugs for Jump, processes chemicals in an abandoned warehouse, and reveals a motivation centered on helping their father — before Bloodhound tracks them down and they surrender the Jump pills. The two vigilantes develop a tentative, wary alliance. Sam's 16th birthday party (Ch. 154) gives way to a midnight patrol where she and Maggie witness Bash using a mysterious autoinjector to dramatically enhance his powers during a gang fight — something different from Jump or Fly — before being arrested again for obstruction.

Interlude MR.4 reveals Richardson's two-front maneuvering: she recruits Patriot, Turbo Jett, Miasma, and Captain Devil to form a government-sanctioned team, appealing to each one's need for redemption or legitimacy. That same night, Porcelain — a high-ranking operative from the global mercenary group Red Calf — arrives to demand Maya's help extracting someone (heavily implied to be Deathgirl) from Daedalus Correctional Facility, and casually purchases Hypeman for Red Calf's use, revealing how far Maya's web of obligations has spread. The Auditors infiltrate Rogue Wave's Jump distribution event at a Pennsport marina (Chs. 156–157), where Monkey Business reveals his supernatural contract-binding power — signing means total loyalty, with a quarter of the crowd already under his control. The operation explodes into a multi-sided brawl involving mind-controlled dealers, Patriot and Turbo Jett (who escalate the violence), and Soot deploying chemical smoke. Rogue Wave then hijacks NBC10 and the emergency alert system (Ch. 158) to broadcast their manifesto, claiming 30,000 contracted individuals in Philadelphia and declaring open war on the Kingdom. Jordan's reckless test at school (Ch. 159) — deliberately claiming Kingdom allegiance to provoke sleeper agents — exposes Officer Ridley as Rogue Wave-contracted, resulting in both Sam and Jordan being suspended.

The arc's climax unfolds across four chapters (161–164). From house arrest, the Auditors trace Tremont & Fairfax's corporate filings to Stheno Pharmaceuticals, a suspicious biomedical front company registered by T&F junior partner Martin Calloway near a known Kingdom location. Amelia provides new stealth costumes and gear, and the team infiltrates the Stheno warehouse on Trenton Avenue. The operation goes loud when Soot appears fighting Kingdom enforcers Bash and Lenny (forcefield generator), filling the warehouse with smoke. Argus Corps arrives for an off-the-books operation — Captain Devil tracks through smoke, Turbo Jett attacks with super-speed and heat, Miasma floods the space with toxic gas, and Patriot orders mass detention. Soot announces intent to release 80 cubic feet of stored chlorine gas to create a chemical chain reaction that will destroy the facility. Sam prioritizes rescuing a zip-tied security guard from the office upstairs; Patriot pursues her, crushing her ankle on the staircase before Jordan severs the stairs with spatial compression. Sam cuts the guard free, breaks the window, and jumps — landing on a cloak held by Jordan and Blink. The warehouse explodes behind them as the chemical chain reaction destroys the entire facility. The Auditors escape via taxi to South Street, laughing hysterically, as Sam glimpses what might be Soot watching from a nearby rooftop. The chapter — and Act One of the story — ends with emergency services rushing toward the explosion site.

## Themes

- **The three-body problem** — Philadelphia's conflict expands from a two-sided struggle into a chaotic three-way war between the Kingdom of Keys, Rogue Wave, and the state (via Argus Corps). The Auditors are caught between all three forces, hunted by criminals and government alike, unable to ally fully with any faction. The warehouse climax literalizes this: Kingdom enforcers, Argus Corps, and Soot all fight simultaneously while the Auditors try to escape with evidence.

- **Contracts, control, and consent** — Monkey Business's binding contracts serve as the arc's central metaphor: people surrender autonomy in exchange for something they want (drugs, money, power). This mirrors Richardson's legislation (surrendering freedom for safety), the Kingdom's hierarchy (loyalty enforced through threat), and even Sam's implicit contract with heroism (sacrificing normalcy for responsibility). Everyone in Book 10 is bound by something they didn't fully understand when they agreed to it.

- **The outsider's burden** — Official institutions consistently fail: the prison transport is ambushed, SARA bans the teenagers who are actually fighting crime, Argus Corps is staffed with morally compromised adults on an off-the-books leash. The Auditors — a group of high schoolers operating from a music hall — produce better intelligence than the DVDs and more meaningful disruption than the police, yet they're the ones getting arrested and suspended.

- **Investigation as weapon** — Book 10 marks the Auditors' evolution from street-level vigilantes to intelligence operatives. Their most significant victories come not from fights but from following paper trails: Tremont & Fairfax's statistical anomalies, Stheno Pharmaceuticals' corporate filings, the USB drives stolen from the warehouse. The pen proves mightier than the fist — though the arc ends with an explosion, the real prize is data.

- **End of innocence / End of Act One** — The arc closes Year Two and what the author calls "Act One (of Three)." The landscape has transformed completely from Book 1: organized crime operates at a national and international scale (Red Calf), the government fields its own cape team, the drug crisis has spawned supernatural mind-control networks, and Sam's teenage team is wanted by every faction. The warehouse explosion serves as both a literal and figurative detonation of the status quo — everything that comes next will be different.

## Threads Planted

- **Monkey Business's contract-binding power** — Rogue Wave's leader possesses a supernatural ability to create binding contracts with physiological and psychological compulsion; the mechanism, limits, and origin of this power are unexplored; contracts appear unbreakable (Chs. 156–158)
- **Rogue Wave's organizational structure and declaration of war** — Rogue Wave reveals its full leadership (Monkey Business, Birthday Suit, Rush Order, Dr. Snake Oil, Dead Drop, Jackpot), claims 30,000+ contracted individuals in Philadelphia and 60,000 along the eastern seaboard (Jordan identifies both as likely inflated), hijacks NBC10 to broadcast a manifesto declaring war on the Kingdom (Ch. 158)
- **Soot as independent vigilante** — A chemical-smoke-powered vigilante emerges who absorbs and releases gases, demonstrates martial arts proficiency, processes chemicals in abandoned warehouses, and claims motivation of helping their father; mounting evidence (build, schedule, regional focus, chemical knowledge, Kate's 3 AM returns, access to Sam's team chat) suggests Soot is Kate Smith, but neither confirms it openly (Chs. 150, 153, So.1, 159–160)
- **Argus Corps** — Richardson's government-sanctioned superhero team (Patriot, Turbo Jett, Miasma, Captain Devil) operates under NSRA Special Directive 14-B with detention powers and mandatory body cameras, but its first field appearance is an off-the-books warehouse operation; the team's true scope exceeds public announcement (Chs. 160, MR.5, 163–164)
- **Porcelain and Red Calf** — A global mercenary organization enters the story through Porcelain, who demands Maya help extract someone (heavily implied to be Deathgirl) from Daedalus Correctional Facility and purchases Hypeman for Red Calf's use; escalates the conflict to international scale (MR.4)
- **Stheno Pharmaceuticals and the Auditors' USB evidence** — Kingdom front company registered by T&F junior partner Martin Calloway; warehouse destroyed by Soot's chemical chain reaction, but Jordan stole USB drives containing unknown evidence about Kingdom drug operations; the contents and their implications are unexplored (Chs. 161–162, 164)
- **Tremont & Fairfax connections** — Major law firm handles a statistically outsized number of superhuman defense cases; connected to Aaron McKinley's funded defense, Stheno Pharmaceuticals' incorporation, and Argus Corps' legal paperwork via Katherine Huang; the full scope of the firm's role in Philadelphia's superhuman ecosystem is unexplored (Chs. 149, 151, 161)
- **Aaron McKinley's mysterious defense funding** — "Concerned citizens for due process" financing Aaron's expensive defense through Tremont & Fairfax; source and motivation unknown (Ch. 149)
- **Bash's autoinjector enhancement** — Kingdom enforcer uses a mysterious autoinjector substance (distinct from Jump or Fly) to dramatically enhance his existing powers, then appears at the Stheno warehouse showing similar enhancement; suggests Hypeman is being deployed at the street level (Chs. 154, 162–163)
- **Captain Devil's abilities** — Argus Corps member can track through Soot's smoke and creates an instinctual fear response in Sam; the nature and full extent of his powers are unexplored (Chs. 163–164)
- **Miasma's selective behavior** — During the warehouse battle, Miasma intentionally avoids confronting Sam, suggesting a hidden agenda or allegiance beyond Argus Corps' stated mission (Ch. 164)
- **Kate's anonymous benefactors** — Kate Smith's father's debts are mysteriously paid off by anonymous donors, enabling their planned move; the source is unknown and Sam is skeptical (Ch. 154)
- **Officer Ridley and institutional infiltration** — School security officer exposed as a Rogue Wave sleeper agent through Jordan's deliberate provocation; demonstrates how deeply contracted individuals have penetrated civilian institutions (Ch. 159)

## Threads Progressed

- **Kingdom of Keys operations** (planted Book 2) — The Kingdom rescues Mr. Nothing and Mudslide via an elaborate highway ambush, regaining key operatives lost in Book 8; operates Stheno Pharmaceuticals as a drug production front; deploys Bash with autoinjector enhancement at street level; loses the Stheno warehouse to Soot's chemical chain reaction but retains organizational infrastructure including the Lancaster steakhouse and Baltimore branch (RG.1, BM.2, Chs. 152, 154, 162–164)
- **Maya Richardson's political rise** (planted Book 7, MR.1) — Richardson introduces the Superhuman Activity Regulation Act, successfully banning minor vigilantism (12-5 vote); forms Argus Corps as a government-sanctioned superhero team; meets with Red Calf's Porcelain, revealing her entanglement extends to international criminal interests; her approval rating takes a hit after Sam's public confrontation but she consolidates institutional power (Chs. 151–152, 160, MR.4, MR.5)
- **Rogue Wave mind control** (planted Book 7, MR.1) — Expands from isolated trigger reactions to a fully revealed mass contract system; Monkey Business's supernatural binding power compels thousands of signatories; Officer Ridley exposed as a sleeper agent embedded in a school; Rogue Wave openly declares war on the Kingdom via broadcast manifesto (Chs. 156–159)
- **Jump/Fly drug crisis** (planted Book 5, Ch. 73) — Jump distribution continues expanding with Rogue Wave using it as a recruitment tool; dealers sign binding contracts for distribution rights; the Kensington streets show worsening conditions; community defense groups ("neighbors with baseball bats") emerge as civilian response (Chs. 150, 154–157)
- **Hypeman drug** (planted Book 9, LTN.2) — Bash's mysterious autoinjector appears to be Hypeman deployed at the street level; Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse likely producing it; Porcelain purchases Hypeman for Red Calf, indicating international demand; warehouse destruction disrupts but does not eliminate production capability (Chs. 154, 162–164, MR.4)
- **The Auditors' operations** (planted Book 7, Chs. 110–111) — Team officially becomes "The Auditors" with Amelia and Lily formally joining; evolves from street-level vigilantism to intelligence work, tracing corporate filings from Tremont & Fairfax to Stheno Pharmaceuticals; executes the marina infiltration and warehouse mission; Jordan acknowledged as tactical leader, Sam as de facto overall leader (Chs. 151–164)
- **Sam's mental health and self-destructive tendencies** (planted Intermission 4.5, Ch. 64) — Sam is arrested twice, suspended from school, grounded, and sustains a crushed ankle during the warehouse escape; Ben Small confronts her self-destructive pattern, comparing it to Pop-Pop Moe's; Sam struggles with the question of how long she can sustain this pace (Chs. 154–155, 160, 164)
