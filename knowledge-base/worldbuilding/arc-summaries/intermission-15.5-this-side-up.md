## Summary

Intermission 15.5 is a structural departure from all previous arcs: it contains no numbered chapters and no Sam Small POV. Instead, it presents eleven interludes functioning as origin stories, backstory vignettes, and present-day side perspectives for characters who have operated in the margins of the main narrative. The author's note at the end of DC.3 explicitly frames this as a reader-driven arc, with the community selecting which characters they wanted to see explored. The result is a mosaic that dramatically deepens the world's history, reveals the secret origins of several major players, and plants critical threads for the arcs ahead.

The intermission opens with DC.3, the only entry set entirely in the story's present timeline. Dean Carver (Rush Order) and Dead Drop, operating under Monkey Business's Camden-based organization, track Maya Richardson through a blizzard to a rooftop where she is manipulating weather. They attempt to capture her, but Maya reveals devastating combat capability -- not weather control, but pressure manipulation (barokinesis). She creates kill zones in enclosed spaces, neutralizes projectiles within her field, and walks away from the confrontation unscathed while Dean and Dead Drop retreat badly injured. Monkey Business classifies her as a hazard to be routed around, not pursued.

JP.2 reveals Joshua Pleasants's (Miasma's) origin: diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease at twenty-two and given four to six months to live, he travels to Mammoth Lakes, California, to die in a volcanic CO2 cave. He survives thirty minutes of lethal exposure, triggering a spontaneous metahuman adaptation that grants him regeneration. His brain rebuilds itself around the prion damage, and his body enters a state of "arrested decomposition" -- heart beating eight to twelve times per minute, blood coagulated to pudding consistency, organs barely functional but kept viable by regeneration. The cost is a horrific chemical smell that requires a permanent hazmat suit. He begins vigilante work in Baltimore, where he meets a woman called Breakout who becomes his first real companion since diagnosis.

LS.3 is the Monkey Business origin story. Lawrence Sullivan is a contract law associate at the Meridian Financial building when armed men take his floor hostage. The leader declares: "We won't hurt any of you as long as everyone in this room cooperates." Lawrence's activation event manifests as the power to make verbal agreements literally binding. He exploits the exact wording -- leaving the room dissolves his cooperation obligation (spatially limited) while the gunmen's non-violence clause persists (no spatial limit). He calls 911, subdues a guard who physically cannot strike him, and the hostages are freed. He discovers the rules of his power: both parties must understand terms, language executes as written not as intended, and enforcement is reality itself. He quits law, buys a monkey mask, and begins recruiting people wronged by broken systems.

TJ.1 traces Turbo Jett's full arc from an eighth-grade school trip in the Poconos, where thirteen-year-old Jasmine is buried in an avalanche and her activation event produces thermokinetic powers that let her melt free and rescue three others. She spends fifteen years as Camden's unofficial protector, fighting villains like Coilgun (a kinetic-multiplier arsonist who forces her to confront the limits of reactive heroism). When her LUMA license is revoked for "disproportionate collateral damage," Maya Richardson's office contacts her, offering a position on a new team -- what will become the Argus Corps. Maya shows Jasmine footage of her own powers being federally banned, creating an instant bond of shared institutional betrayal.

FF.1 is a TIME Magazine interview (dated August 10, 2021) with Felix Fleischer, known as Dr. Necrosis -- described as the world's most notorious supervillain. A German bioterrorist who engineers targeted pathogens against pharmaceutical companies, Fleischer has killed only about a dozen people in two decades, preferring "maximum psychological impact with minimum actual harm." His signature attack -- a virus causing stigmata-like bleeding at a Meridian Therapeutics shareholder meeting -- exemplifies his philosophy: spectacle as rhetoric, terror as argument. He sells novel pathogens to pharmaceutical companies with the condition that all resulting research be open-sourced, using their payments to fund his campaigns against them. He explicitly distinguishes himself from "sloppy" imitators like Shrike, describing them as people who "leak" their psychology into their work. He plans to eventually surrender to a superhuman prison when his work is complete.

TF.1 and TF.2 together form the origin of Trent Fairfax, revealed as Mr. Antithesis -- the head of the Kingdom of Keys. TF.1 follows his childhood: a gifted boy with OCD and germaphobia who obsessively studies comic book villains, cataloguing their strategic mistakes. He thrives in Columbia Law School, where the Socratic method feels like debugging. TF.2 picks up after his first year of law school, when he overhears powered criminals planning a robbery and is assaulted by a hydrokinetic (Cryo) and a pyrokinetic (Firebrand), triggering his activation event (the exact nature of his power remains deliberately ambiguous -- nosebleeds, steam, something that disrupts the attackers). The interlude then jumps forward: Trent runs an investment firm called Alcott & Associates, visits a hospital ward he personally funds for victims of the Phreaks' courthouse attack (including Marcus Whitmore, who was reduced to a puddle), and has a secretary named Ophelia with blue skin. He has a wife named Sarah. The interlude culminates with Trent visiting Aaron McKinley (Mr. Prometheus) in prison under the guise of legal counsel, offering him a dose of Fly and Kingdom membership in exchange for killing Samantha Small.

AM.1 presents Andrew Mitchell, Captain Devil of the Argus Corps, in his daily life. His activation event came from a bear attack in the Pine Barrens a decade ago. He commutes via SEPTA, has two children (Malik, ten; Destiny, seven) and a wife Diana who works as a pediatric nurse. His day includes briefings on a phase-walking teenager destroying drug supplies in Kensington (morally complicated), rumors of a new substance called "Love Potion Number Ten," and the ongoing hunt for the armored car thief Turnout. Critically, Jett steals Patriot's phone and discovers he has been researching barokinesis, a man named Richard Duvall, weather reports from two years prior, and Councilman Silverstein. Captain Devil reveals that Patriot told Maya Richardson about Sam's accusations against her months ago. The team's investigation into Tremont & Fairfax (the Kingdom-connected law firm) has hit a dead end, with Trent Fairfax appearing aggressively clean on paper.

CE.1 follows Chezki Espinosa, an Israeli special forces operative sent to capture a target in Rafah. His own command shells the building while he is inside -- deliberately, prioritizing a confirmed kill over extraction. His activation event under the rubble grants extraordinary strength and near-invulnerability. He becomes Israel's super-weapon, encased in 160-kilogram ceramic armor painted white. He helps construct Daedalus prison, where he meets John Cross (a British saboteur/chemist who stress-tests containment cells) and Moe Small (Sam's grandfather, working as a weatherproofing contractor). After years of deployment to Iran, Lebanon, and Syria, Espinosa confronts Israeli politicians in the Knesset, physically lifts a general by the skull, and resigns. He flees to a safe house in Cyprus before being contacted by Cross.

JW.2 is a text conversation between Jordan Westwood and Sam Small. Jordan, now at MIT, announces they are fourth author on a scientific preprint about Anomalously Originated Material (AOM). The paper proposes that all superpowered matter creation is a "quantum mirage" -- powers overlay existing matter with templates borrowed from nearby baseline molecules via quantum entanglement, one molecule at a time, every "frame" of reality. AOM doesn't truly exist as independent matter; when it dissolves, it simply ceases to be, leaving no residue. The existing matter is "telefragged" -- overwritten in place -- which explains why sealed chamber experiments show no pressure changes. Jordan is considering switching from Computer Science to Dynology. Sam's ankle monitor has recently been removed, and she obliquely references a councilwoman's alibi being exposed (Book 15 events).

CM.1 introduces Claymore (Clay), a member of the Boston Red Shocks -- a leftist cell of powered activists. Clay's power allows her to detonate parts of her body (fingernails at roughly 150 joules each, hair as detonation cord) and regenerate them. Her activation event at "the Commons" accidentally injured nearly a hundred people. Her team includes The Colonel (leader, carries a Walther PPK), Ghostwriter (archival gloves, book-related absorption powers), Red Scare (speed and stealth), and Lavender Girl (plant growth, botanist). The interlude follows an operation to breach Alcott Properties and copy documents proving a real estate developer's collusion with city officials in forced evictions. Clay handles all the locks with carefully calibrated fingernail detonations, the team successfully copies the documents, and they escape cleanly, planning to distribute the evidence to journalists. The interlude ends with the formal declaration: END OF ARC 15.5: THIS SIDE UP.

## Themes

- **The cost of origin** -- Every activation event in this intermission involves near-death or extreme trauma: burial in snow, CO2 suffocation, hostage assault, building collapse, bear attack, crowd explosion. The intermission frames superpowers not as gifts but as survival responses extracted at terrible cost. Joshua Pleasants's "arrested decomposition" is the most literal expression: he got exactly what he wanted (survival) and it turned him into something that smells like death.
- **Systems and their failures** -- Nearly every character is motivated by institutional betrayal: Monkey Business by a legal system that protects the powerful, Turbo Jett by a licensing bureaucracy that revoked her LUMA, Captain Devil by a government structure that may be compromised, Espinosa by a military that shelled its own operative, Claymore by economic systems that enable displacement. Even Dr. Necrosis frames his bioterrorism as a response to regulatory failure.
- **The architect revealed** -- TF.1 and TF.2 are the single largest revelation in the arc: Trent Fairfax, the OCD comic book kid who catalogued villains' mistakes, grew up to become Mr. Antithesis, head of the Kingdom of Keys. His childhood analytical tendencies -- studying failure modes, optimizing strategies, finding loopholes -- are shown as the direct precursors to his criminal empire. The intermission frames him as a villain who learned from every villain who came before.
- **Who watches the watchmen** -- AM.1 reveals deep fractures within the Argus Corps: Patriot may be compromised (researching barokinesis, sharing Sam's accusations with Maya), Miasma is cryptic and possibly disengaged, and the team's investigation into Tremont & Fairfax has hit a wall. The heroes' own institution may be penetrated by the very organization they're hunting.
- **Chosen violence, measured violence** -- Multiple characters grapple with calibrating their destructive potential: Claymore learning to spend fingernails like currency, Dr. Necrosis designing viruses for "maximum psychological impact with minimum actual harm," Monkey Business crafting contracts whose exact wording becomes a weapon. The intermission distinguishes between characters who control their violence and those who are controlled by it.
- **The quantum mirage** -- Jordan's AOM research provides a scientific framework for the story's powers: all superpowered matter is an overlay, a collage of borrowed properties that ceases to exist when the overlay stops. This metaphor extends to the characters themselves -- many of them are overlays on who they used to be, maintaining functionality through constant renewal while the original person is effectively gone.

## Threads Planted

- **Maya Richardson's barokinesis** -- Her true power is pressure manipulation, not weather control; atmospheric effects are secondary. She can create lethal pressure gradients in enclosed spaces, neutralize projectiles, control her descent, and maintain a pressure field around her body that stops blood from leaving wounds. Indoor spaces become kill zones. (DC.3)
- **Monkey Business's contract powers** -- Verbal agreements become literally binding through reality enforcement. Rules: both parties must understand terms; language executes as written (not intended); spatial and temporal limitations in wording create exploitable loopholes; enforcement is mutual. This power has implications for every deal the Kingdom has made. (LS.3)
- **Miasma's terminal condition** -- Despite regeneration, Miasma's CJD may still be progressing; his brain rebuilds around the damage but the prions persist. His body is in "arrested decomposition" -- heart at 8-12 bpm, blood like pudding, organs barely functional. The smell requires permanent containment. He doesn't feel pain and has full muscle recruitment. (JP.2)
- **Mr. Antithesis is Trent Fairfax** -- The Kingdom's leader is a Columbia-educated lawyer with OCD, a wife named Sarah, a secretary named Ophelia (blue-skinned), and a front company called Alcott & Associates. He personally recruited Mr. Prometheus (Aaron McKinley) to kill Sam, offering him Fly and Kingdom membership. His exact power remains ambiguous. (TF.1, TF.2)
- **Trent Fairfax funds Phreaks victim care** -- Trent personally funds the hospital ward treating victims of the courthouse attack, including Marcus Whitmore. He acknowledges the chain of causation: Maya brought Deathgirl into the fold, Maya operates under him, making him responsible. This suggests genuine conscience operating alongside criminal enterprise. (TF.2)
- **Patriot's compromised loyalty** -- Patriot told Maya about Sam's accusations against her months ago. His phone reveals research into barokinesis, T-Rex (unknown significance), Richard Duvall, weather reports from two years prior, and Councilman Silverstein. His motivations and allegiance are unclear. (AM.1)
- **Tremont & Fairfax investigation stalled** -- The FBI found nothing on Trent Fairfax. The firm handled Aaron McKinley's case and several other Philadelphia criminal defense cases. Trent appears "boringly, aggressively clean" -- either innocent or hiding in plain sight with exceptional skill. (AM.1)
- **The Kensington phase-walker** -- A teenager phasing through pharmacy walls to destroy drug supplies (fentanyl, oxy, Jump). Morally complicated for Captain Devil. Not apprehended. (AM.1)
- **Love Potion Number Ten** -- Rumored new substance: small glass phials of bubbling pink liquid that produces heart-shaped smoke; allegedly causes the consumer to fall in love for a day or two. No confirmed cases yet. (AM.1)
- **Chezki Espinosa's mercenary network** -- After resigning from Israel, Espinosa connects with John Cross and an international network of operatives who worked on Daedalus. Phone numbers, email addresses -- "people who understand what it means to be used, and who might want to be used on their own terms." (CE.1)
- **Moe Small at Daedalus** -- Sam's grandfather worked as a weatherproofing contractor during Daedalus prison's construction, placing him in proximity to both Espinosa and Cross. A comic book reader with kind eyes. (CE.1)
- **AOM quantum mirage theory** -- Superpowered matter creation works by overlaying quantum-entangled templates borrowed from nearby baseline matter, one molecule per frame of reality. AOM "telefrag" overwrites existing matter in place. AOM ceases to exist entirely when the overlay stops (no residue). Most powered people cannot create AOM inside living bodies. (JW.2)
- **Jordan's academic pivot** -- Jordan is considering switching from Computer Science to Dynology at MIT. They are fourth author on a published preprint and have their own lab space. (JW.2)
- **The Boston Red Shocks** -- A leftist cell of powered activists in Boston: The Colonel, Ghostwriter, Red Scare, Lavender Girl, and Claymore. They do targeted document liberation and property disruption, explicitly not violence against people. Connected to a broader Northeast mutual aid network. (CM.1)
- **Claymore's Commons incident** -- Clay's activation event at "the Commons" accidentally injured approximately one hundred people. The guilt drives her precision training. (CM.1)
- **Turbo Jett's recruitment by Maya** -- Maya Richardson personally recruited Jasmine after her LUMA revocation, showing her footage of Maya's own powers being federally banned. This created a bond of shared institutional betrayal that may explain Jett's loyalty. (TJ.1)

## Threads Progressed

- **Maya Richardson / Mrs. Zenith's true capabilities** (planted Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only) -- Maya's power is confirmed as pressure manipulation, with weather effects being secondary applications. Her combat ability far exceeds what the Camden operatives expected: she can neutralize projectile weapons, create crushing pressure in enclosed spaces, use pressure differentials for mobility, and maintain a defensive field around her body. Even Rush Order's passive aerokinesis barely kept him alive.
- **Kingdom of Keys organizational structure** (planted Book 1: Pup) -- The Kingdom's leadership hierarchy becomes significantly clearer: Mr. Antithesis (Trent Fairfax) sits at the top, with Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) as his Philadelphia lieutenant. Monkey Business (Lawrence Sullivan) operates a Camden faction. The organization recruits through quid pro quo, legal defense, and targeted offers to the desperate.
- **Mr. Prometheus / Aaron McKinley's prison arc** (planted Book 4: Exorcism) -- McKinley is shown in prison, blinded by a blackout mask, his right arm in a medical brace from Sam's doing. Trent Fairfax visits as his "new lawyer," offering him Fly, Kingdom membership, and dominion over Camden in exchange for killing Sam Small. This sets up his eventual prison break and return.
- **The Argus Corps internal tensions** (planted Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only) -- The team's fractures deepen: Patriot may be feeding information to Maya, Miasma is increasingly distant, and Captain Devil and Jett are conducting their own off-book investigation into Tremont & Fairfax. The institutional framework meant to contain Kingdom is potentially compromised from within.
- **Daedalus prison's construction and purpose** (planted Book 7: Jaws of Life) -- Daedalus is shown during construction: international collaboration, modular containment cells, stress-tested by John Cross. Espinoza and Small were both present, connecting Sam's family history to the prison system that later becomes plot-relevant.
- **Joshua Pleasants / Miasma's backstory** (planted Intermission 4.5: Amnion) -- Sam requested help exonerating Miasma back in Intermission 4.5. Now his full origin is revealed: the CJD diagnosis, the activation event, the arrested decomposition, and his path to Baltimore where he meets Breakout. His condition explains his hazmat suit, his smell, and his cryptic behavior on the Argus Corps.
- **Jordan Westwood's academic career** (planted Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only) -- Jordan has progressed from MIT student to published researcher. Their spatial powers make them uniquely valuable for AOM research, and their understanding of power mechanics continues to deepen. They're the story's primary voice for the scientific framework underlying all superpowers.
- **Sam's ankle monitor and legal status** (planted Book 15: Severe Weather Warning) -- Sam's ankle monitor has been removed, confirming her legal situation has improved following Book 15's events. She obliquely references a councilwoman's alibi being exposed. (JW.2)

## Threads Resolved

- **Monkey Business's identity and origin** -- Lawrence Sullivan's civilian identity, his power (contract enforcement), and his origin story (hostage situation at Meridian Financial) are fully revealed. His power explains how the Camden organization maintains loyalty and enforces agreements, and why his verbal promises carry absolute weight. Originally a mystery from Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only.
- **Turbo Jett's background** -- Jasmine's full arc from civilian to hero to government operative is traced, explaining her presence on the Argus Corps and her complicated relationship with Maya Richardson. Her LUMA revocation and Maya's recruitment fill in how the team was assembled. Originally a background question from Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only.
- **The nature of Maya's power** -- Definitively answered as barokinesis (pressure manipulation), not weather control. The atmospheric effects that made everyone assume she was a weather controller are just secondary applications of pressure differential manipulation. Originally ambiguous since her first appearances.
- **Rush Order's homing ability** -- Dean Carver's power set is fully demonstrated: speedster with passive aerokinesis (body automatically compensates for movement physics) and a homing sense (compass-like tracking of specific people). Originally partially shown in earlier interludes.
