## Overview

The Metahuman Visual Classification system is a five-category taxonomic framework that sorts metahumans according to how their powers manifest physically and visually. Unlike the PERKS Assessment, which evaluates the tactical and threat dimensions of a metahuman's abilities, the Visual Classification system focuses on the physiological relationship between a metahuman and their powers -- specifically, whether those powers produce permanent bodily changes, cause self-harm, or both.

The system serves a broad range of institutional functions. Healthcare providers use it to anticipate the specialized medical needs associated with each category. Law enforcement agencies reference it when developing interaction protocols for metahuman encounters. Public services such as education, housing, and social welfare draw on the framework to design appropriate accommodations and anti-discrimination measures. For metahumans themselves, the classification offers a shared vocabulary for understanding their own conditions and advocating for their needs.

Developed by the Metahuman Research and Policy Institute (MRPI), the current framework is universally accepted within U.S. academic and governmental circles. It replaced earlier, more rudimentary systems that focused narrowly on destructive potential or relied on stigmatizing labels.

## Mechanics

### Category Structure

The system divides metahumans into five numbered categories (0 through 4), each defined by two primary axes: the visibility of physical changes caused by the metahuman's powers, and whether those powers inflict harm on the user. A metahuman's category is determined by the permanent or default-state effects of their abilities, not by what occurs during active power use. For example, a metahuman who generates fire but returns to a normal appearance afterward is classified differently from one whose skin is permanently altered by their power.

### Category 0: Non-Identifiable Metahumans (NIM)

NIMs possess metahuman abilities that produce no permanent or visible changes to their physical appearance. Their powers can be activated and deactivated at will without leaving lasting visual markers. When not actively using their abilities, NIMs are indistinguishable from baseline humans. This category comprises a significant portion of the metahuman population. Typical examples include telekinesis, accelerated healing, and enhanced senses.

### Category 1: Minimally-Identifiable Metahumans (MIM)

MIMs exhibit subtle but noticeable visual distinctions resulting from their metahuman abilities. These markers are permanent or semi-permanent but can often be concealed through makeup, clothing, contact lenses, or other forms of disguise. The alterations are not life-threatening or significantly disfiguring. Examples include unusual eye colors, visible subcutaneous veins, sharpened teeth, and unusually pronounced musculature. MIMs occupy a grey area between the invisible NIMs and the unmistakably altered VAMs.

### Category 2: Visually Apparent Metahumans (VAM)

VAMs possess metahuman abilities that result in permanent, visible alterations to their physical appearance that cannot be easily concealed. These individuals are typically recognizable as metahumans on sight. Examples include rock-like skin, constant bioluminescence, webbed appendages, and gills. VAMs face the most significant social stigma tied directly to appearance, though some specialized industries -- construction, security, entertainment, marine operations -- actively seek individuals with these traits.

### Category 3: Auto-Destructive Metahumans (ADM)

ADMs are metahumans whose abilities pose a direct risk to their own physical well-being when used. The self-inflicted harm may occur immediately upon activation or accumulate over prolonged usage, and the damage is not mitigated by any other aspect of the ability itself. This category includes both voluntary and involuntary power activation. Examples include electrical discharge that causes burns to the user, bone manipulation that weakens skeletal integrity, and time perception alteration that accelerates neural degeneration. ADMs require specialized medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and psychological support, often at substantial personal expense.

### Category 4: Complex-Condition Metahumans (CCM)

CCMs represent the intersection of Categories 2 and 3, experiencing both permanent visible disfigurements and auto-destructive effects from their abilities. Some CCMs can mitigate self-harm by refraining from active power use, while others possess "always-on" abilities that produce a constant state of degeneration or suffering. Examples include radiation manipulation coupled with translucent skin, acid secretion combined with scaled epidermis, and non-functional wing growths paired with hollow, brittle bones. CCMs have the highest need for medical support and face the greatest economic burden of any category.

## History

The first attempts to classify metahumans began in the early 1980s, shortly after the initial emergence of the metahuman population. These early systems were crude, relying on surface-level characteristics such as the visible spectacle of a power or the level of destruction it could cause. The terminology of this era -- words like "mutant" and "freak" -- reflected the confusion and fear that attended the public's first encounters with superhumans.

During the 1990s, influenced by advances in psychology, physiology, and social science, the discourse shifted toward more capability-focused descriptors. Stigmatizing labels fell out of mainstream use, and researchers began proposing classification models with greater academic rigor. Several competing frameworks emerged over the following decade, some praised for their nuance and others criticized for perpetuating stereotypes or oversimplifying the complexity of metahuman conditions.

The current system was established in the early 2000s under the auspices of the Metahuman Research and Policy Institute (MRPI). The MRPI framework was considered revolutionary for its balanced, holistic approach: rather than focusing solely on physical manifestations, it incorporated sociological, psychological, and ethical dimensions. This allowed the system to serve not only as a scientific taxonomy but also as a practical tool for healthcare providers, law enforcement agencies, and metahumans themselves. It has since been universally adopted within U.S. academic and governmental institutions.

## Implications

### Healthcare

Each category carries distinct medical considerations. NIMs may need protocols around disclosure during treatment. MIMs sometimes require specialized care that accounts for minor physiological differences, such as unique dental structures. VAMs and ADMs demand more intensive medical infrastructure -- custom prosthetics, pharmaceuticals to mitigate self-inflicted damage, and ongoing specialist attention. CCMs face the highest medical burden, often requiring round-the-clock care, specialized equipment, and support devices that are not mass-produced and are therefore prohibitively expensive. Healthcare providers across all categories must balance appropriate treatment with confidentiality to prevent stigmatization.

### Economic Burden

The financial costs of living as a metahuman vary dramatically by category. ADMs face significant expenses for medical devices and pharmaceuticals. CCMs bear the heaviest economic burden; documented cases show annual medical costs of $20,000 or more, compounded by income loss and the need for government aid. Approximately 40% of unregistered metahumans face financial hardship, and metahumans as a population experience mental health issues at a rate 30% higher than the baseline population.

### Law Enforcement

The classification system informs law enforcement protocols for metahuman interactions. NIMs present challenges because their abilities are not outwardly apparent, requiring officers to account for hidden capabilities. Metahumans with visually spectacular abilities across all categories may trigger crisis situations if their appearance startles law enforcement personnel. Agencies are expected to develop category-aware protocols that avoid profiling or the use of undue force. The visual classification system operates in parallel with, but distinct from, the PERKS threat assessment used for tactical and criminal contexts.

### Public Services and Anti-Discrimination

ADMs may require special accommodations in schools, workplaces, and public spaces. VAMs and CCMs face the highest risk of overt discrimination in employment, housing, and social settings. Public services are expected to adapt to be inclusive and nondiscriminatory, though accessibility remains an ongoing challenge -- particularly for CCMs, who may not have the means to access existing support programs.

## Trivia

- The system replaced earlier terminology including "mutant" and "freak," which fell out of use during the 1990s as public discourse became more sophisticated.
- The classification framework is presented as Chapter 7 of a textbook used in academic settings, complete with case studies and discussion questions for students.
- Category 3 (ADM) is the only category defined entirely by the relationship between the power and the user's well-being rather than by visual appearance, meaning an ADM may look identical to a NIM.
- CCMs are sometimes described as experiencing their superpower as a functional disability, with documented annual costs exceeding those of many chronic baseline-human conditions.
- The system was designed to be adaptable; the MRPI anticipates future revisions driven by scientific research, technological advances, legal changes, and shifts in public opinion.
