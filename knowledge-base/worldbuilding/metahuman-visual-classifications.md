# Metahuman Visual Classifications

> The five-tier taxonomic system used to categorize metahumans based on the degree to which their powers visibly and physically affect their appearance and well-being, ranging from Non-Identifiable (Category 0) to Complex-Condition (Category 4).

## Overview

The Metahuman Visual Classification system is a five-category framework sorting metahumans by how their powers manifest physically. Unlike PERKS, which evaluates tactical threat, this system focuses on whether powers produce permanent bodily changes, cause self-harm, or both.

It serves broad institutional functions: healthcare providers anticipate medical needs, law enforcement develops interaction protocols, and public services design accommodations. For metahumans, the classification provides a shared vocabulary for advocating for their needs.

Developed by the Metahuman Research and Policy Institute (MRPI), the current framework is universally accepted in U.S. academic and governmental circles, replacing earlier systems that relied on stigmatizing labels or focused narrowly on destructive potential.

## Mechanics

### Category Structure

The five categories (0-4) are defined by two axes: visibility of physical changes and whether powers inflict self-harm. Classification is based on permanent or default-state effects, not what occurs during active use.

### Category 0: Non-Identifiable Metahumans (NIM)

NIMs possess abilities producing no permanent visible changes. When not actively using powers, they are indistinguishable from baseline humans. This comprises a significant portion of the metahuman population. Examples include telekinesis, accelerated healing, and enhanced senses.

### Category 1: Minimally-Identifiable Metahumans (MIM)

MIMs exhibit subtle but noticeable visual markers - permanent or semi-permanent but concealable through makeup, clothing, or contact lenses. Alterations are not life-threatening or significantly disfiguring. Examples include unusual eye colors, visible subcutaneous veins, sharpened teeth, and pronounced musculature.

### Category 2: Visually Apparent Metahumans (VAM)

VAMs have permanent, visible alterations that cannot be easily concealed, making them recognizable as metahumans on sight. Examples include rock-like skin, bioluminescence, webbed appendages, and gills. VAMs face significant appearance-based stigma, though specialized industries (construction, security, entertainment, marine operations) actively seek these traits.

### Category 3: Auto-Destructive Metahumans (ADM)

ADMs have abilities posing direct risk to their own well-being - self-harm occurring immediately or accumulating over prolonged use, unmitigated by the ability itself. Includes both voluntary and involuntary activation. Examples: electrical discharge causing burns to the user, bone manipulation weakening skeletal integrity, and time perception alteration accelerating neural degeneration. ADMs require specialized medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and psychological support at substantial expense.

### Category 4: Complex-Condition Metahumans (CCM)

CCMs combine Categories 2 and 3 - permanent visible disfigurements plus auto-destructive effects. Some can mitigate self-harm by avoiding power use; others have "always-on" abilities producing constant degeneration. Examples: radiation manipulation with translucent skin, acid secretion with scaled epidermis, and non-functional wings with hollow, brittle bones. CCMs face the highest medical needs and economic burden.

## History

Early 1980s classification attempts were crude, relying on destructive potential and stigmatizing terms like "mutant" and "freak." During the 1990s, advances in psychology and social science shifted discourse toward capability-focused descriptors with greater academic rigor.

The MRPI established the current system in the early 2000s with a holistic approach incorporating sociological, psychological, and ethical dimensions alongside physical manifestation - making it both scientific taxonomy and practical tool for healthcare, law enforcement, and metahumans themselves.

## Implications

### Healthcare

NIMs may need disclosure protocols during treatment. MIMs sometimes require care for minor physiological differences (e.g., unique dental structures). VAMs and ADMs demand more intensive infrastructure - custom prosthetics, pharmaceuticals, and specialist attention. CCMs face the highest burden, often needing round-the-clock care and specialized equipment that is not mass-produced and therefore prohibitively expensive.

### Economic Burden

ADMs face significant medical device and pharmaceutical expenses. CCMs bear the heaviest burden: annual costs of $20,000 or more, compounded by income loss. Approximately 40% of unregistered metahumans face financial hardship, and the metahuman population experiences 30% higher rates of mental health issues than the baseline.

### Law Enforcement

NIMs present challenges because abilities are not outwardly apparent. Visually distinct metahumans may trigger crisis situations if their appearance startles personnel. Agencies are expected to develop category-aware protocols avoiding profiling or undue force. The system operates parallel to but distinct from PERKS.

### Public Services and Anti-Discrimination

VAMs and CCMs face the highest discrimination risk in employment, housing, and social settings. Accessibility remains an ongoing challenge, particularly for CCMs who may lack means to access existing support programs.

## Classification / Taxonomy

| Category | Designation | Full Name | Visible Changes | Self-Harm from Power Use | Concealability | Examples |
|----------|------------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------|----------|
| 0 | NIM | Non-Identifiable Metahuman | None | No | Fully concealable (no markers present) | Telekinesis, accelerated healing, enhanced hearing |
| 1 | MIM | Minimally-Identifiable Metahuman | Subtle, minor | No | Can be disguised with effort | Unusual eye color, visible veins, sharpened teeth, pronounced musculature |
| 2 | VAM | Visually Apparent Metahuman | Permanent, significant | No | Cannot be easily concealed | Rock-like skin, bioluminescence, webbed appendages, gills |
| 3 | ADM | Auto-Destructive Metahuman | Varies | Yes (immediate or cumulative) | N/A (defined by self-harm, not appearance) | Self-damaging electrical discharge, painful bone manipulation, neural-damaging time perception |
| 4 | CCM | Complex-Condition Metahuman | Permanent, significant | Yes (immediate or cumulative; may be always-on) | Cannot be concealed | Radiation manipulation with translucent skin, acid secretion with scaled skin, non-functional wings with brittle bones |

## Related Concepts

- **PERKS Assessment** - Evaluates what a metahuman can do; Visual Classification evaluates how powers affect the user's own body.
- **LUMA** - Visual classification may influence accommodations available to licensed metahumans.
- **Metahuman Research and Policy Institute (MRPI)** - Developed the current framework in the early 2000s.
- **Auto-Destructive Activation Events (AAEs)** - Catastrophic manifestation incidents closely related to ADM and CCM categories.
- **Metahuman Healthcare** - Uses visual classification to determine care type and intensity.
- **NSRA** - Uses the system in conjunction with PERKS for comprehensive assessment.

## Trivia

- The framework appears as Chapter 7 of an academic textbook, complete with case studies and discussion questions.
- ADM is the only category defined entirely by self-harm rather than visual appearance, meaning an ADM may look identical to a NIM.
- The system was designed to be adaptable; the MRPI anticipates future revisions driven by research, technology, legal changes, and public opinion.
