## Overview

Hyperball is a superhuman-exclusive competitive sport that emerged in response to the broad-scale ban on metahuman athletes from traditional professional sports. It blends elements of rugby, soccer, basketball, and dodgeball, emphasizing tactical thinking and precise ball manipulation using superhuman abilities. Players may use powers to move the ball and themselves, but direct use on opponents is prohibited.

Played on a three-zone rectangular field with seven players per side over two 25-minute halves, Hyperball is distinguished by its ball draft system: teams select from 18 regulation balls of varying properties, each favoring different power sets. The league comprises 25 professional teams across six continents, with an annual season culminating in the Hyperball World Cup.

## Mechanics

### Field Layout

The playing field is divided into three equal sections:

- **End Zones** -- Each team occupies one End Zone (each comprising one-third of the field), where their goal is located. Players defend their own End Zone and cannot cross into the opponent's End Zone.
- **Middle Zone** -- The central third of the field, where most active play takes place. Both teams contest possession and attempt shots from this shared space.

Each End Zone contains a goal. The objective is to propel the ball into the opponent's goal from the Middle Zone or the player's own End Zone, without entering the opponent's territory.

### Core Rules

- **Scoring** - A point is scored by launching the ball into the opponent's goal.
- **Possession** - Maximum five seconds before passing or shooting. The ball may be thrown, kicked, or propelled with powers.
- **No Tackling** - Physical contact is prohibited; the sport emphasizes power-assisted ball control over confrontation.
- **Fouls** - Result in possession turnover; severe or repeated fouls cause ejection.
- **Goalkeepers** - Each team designates one goalkeeper who may use powers to defend the goal.

### Ball Draft System

Before regulation matches, captains participate in a pick-and-ban draft from the 18 league-approved balls:

1. Lower-ranked team picks first (coin flip tiebreaker).
2. Captains alternate pick-one-ban-one until six balls are selected.
3. After a goal, the conceding team selects which drafted ball enters play next.

Non-regulation matches may use any balls without drafting.

### Regulation Balls

The International Hyperball League defines 18 balls across five size categories for regulation play:

#### Small Balls (Baseball/Tennis Ball Sized)

| Ball | Diameter | Weight | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Standard Rubber Ball | 7 cm | 145 g | All-purpose; favored by strong throwers and pitchers |
| Steel Sphere | 7 cm | 850 g | Heavy, poor flight; suited for defensive play or super-strength teams |
| Textured Silicone Ball | 7 cm | 150 g | Enhanced grip surface; easy to catch and release by hand |

#### Medium Balls (Soccer Ball/Volleyball Sized)

| Ball | Diameter | Weight | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Regulation Leather Ball | 22 cm | 430 g | Predictable aerodynamics; selected every season since the league's founding |
| Aluminum Sphere | 22 cm | 1,300 g | Heaviest medium ball; reliable when thrown with both hands |
| Rubber-Coated Foam Ball | 22 cm | 200 g | Lightweight; easy to deflect but difficult to control in flight |

#### Large Balls (Beach Ball Sized)

| Ball | Diameter | Weight | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Giant Plastic Ball | 61 cm | 500 g | Very lightweight; favored by air manipulators and precision players |
| Rubber Bladder Ball | 61 cm | 1,500 g | Rebounds forcefully from attempted catches; hard to intercept |
| Vulcanized Rubber Ball | 61 cm | 3,500 g | Extremely heavy; nearly impossible to make airborne; favored by strength-based or ground-contact powers |

#### Extra Small Balls (Golf Ball Sized)

| Ball | Diameter | Weight | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Micro Steel Sphere | 4.3 cm | 200 g | Smallest and heaviest in class; suited for precision pitchers |
| Rubber Ball | 4.3 cm | 45 g | High-bounce; unpredictable trajectory |
| Composite Plastic Ball | 4.3 cm | 50 g | Balanced weight and size characteristics |
| Dimpled Resin Ball | 4.3 cm | 45 g | Reduced air resistance; favored by those with the strength and precision to shoot directly into the goal |

#### Weird Balls (Unique Shapes)

| Ball | Dimensions | Weight | Notes |
|------|------------|--------|-------|
| American Football-shaped Ball | 28 cm long | 410 g | Elongated; preferred by throwers over kickers |
| Flat Disc | 22 cm diameter | 175 g | Frisbee-like flight with a long, predictable arc |
| Shot Put | 11 cm diameter | 7,200 g | Heaviest ball in play; used almost exclusively by super-strength or telekinetic teams |
| Sand Sack | 35 cm long | 300 g | Irregularly shaped; shifts form in flight and on catch |
| Silicone Octahedron | 15 cm side length | 400 g | Eight-faced; unpredictable bounce and roll; sometimes picked as a psychological gambit |

### League Structure

The International Hyperball League comprises 25 professional teams. Each yearly season culminates in the **Hyperball World Cup**, a double-elimination bracket tournament featuring the top 8 teams. Structural rules include:

- The worst-performing teams in a given season receive first pick of emerging talent.
- The 18-ball selection for the following season can only be voted on by teams that did not qualify for that year's World Cup.

## History

### Origins: The Superhuman Sports Ban (2006-2008)

In 2006, Croatian basketball player Marko Varga - possessing superhuman strength and enhanced reflexes - shattered records during the European Basketball League finals. When his abilities were revealed, the EBL revoked his MVP award and struck his team's victory. The incident provoked intense debate over superhumans in competitive sports.

In May 2008, the International Athletic Federation, FIFA, the NBA, Major League Baseball, and other bodies enacted sweeping bans on athletes with superhuman physiological advantages. Rules mandated genetic testing, performance evaluations, and contract clauses for immediate withdrawal should abilities manifest. Retroactive audits voided existing contracts and titles.

Polling showed 62% supported the ban on fairness grounds, while 35% opposed it as discriminatory. The International Superhuman Athletes Coalition (ISAC) filed legal challenges in multiple countries.

### Founding and Early Growth (2008-2010)

The Professional Hyperball League was founded in 2008, with Commissioner Adrian Wang describing the mission as building a space where superhumans could thrive athletically. The league reported a 40% ticket sales increase following the IAF announcement.

The 2010 Championship at Vanguard Arena in Miami saw the Phoenix Steamrollers defeat the Stockholm Vikings 11-8. Steamrollers captain Julia Reyes - a former collegiate volleyball star who could leap five stories - became a prominent face of the sport, alongside the Vikings' Magnus "Stormrider" Karlsson (air-current manipulation) and Steamrollers telekinetic Riko Amara. Championship tickets sold out in under an hour, establishing Hyperball as a viable spectator sport.

### Continued Expansion

The league expanded to 25 teams worldwide, and the International Hyperball League formalized rules, the 18-ball regulation pool, and the World Cup tournament format.

## Implications

For many in the superhuman community, Hyperball functions as a cultural statement against exclusion - a reclamation of space denied by traditional institutions.

Economically, the league has demonstrated that superhuman-focused entertainment can sustain professional-level infrastructure, including arenas, merchandise lines (notably "ball packs" for recreational play), and broadcast deals.

Unlike underground powered fighting circuits - which operate illegally and involve direct violence tied to criminal gambling - Hyperball channels abilities into a regulated, non-contact framework, cultivating mainstream legitimacy. Whether the sport can build the long-term rivalries and dynasties that sustain traditional fandom remains debated.
