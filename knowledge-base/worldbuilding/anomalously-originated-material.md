## Overview

Anomalously Originated Material (AOM) refers to matter spontaneously generated from nothing by metahumans, most commonly those classified under the Create (C) category in the PERKS system. Popularly called "Capestuff" or "Exotic Matter," AOM has been studied since the first recorded instances in the early 1980s, coinciding with the broader emergence of metahuman activity.

For decades, AOM research was fragmented across disciplines with no shared vocabulary. This changed in 2002 when Dr. Abraham Clarke published his landmark paper, "Anomalously Originated Materials: Bridging Physics-Defying Manifestations and Exo-Biological Generation," providing the first unified terminology and classification system. Clarke's work catalyzed an era of interdisciplinary collaboration that continues to define the field.

AOM encompasses only spontaneously generated matter, not exotic energy. The distinction carries practical significance for researchers, policymakers, and emergency responders, as containment and mitigation protocols differ substantially between the two.

## Mechanics

### Temporal Constraints

All AOM is transient, with a median lifespan of approximately two hours. Duration is governed by the LeBlanc Constants (named after researcher Jacques LeBlanc), which account for variables including molecular complexity and energy state. Outliers exist at both extremes: some AOM persists for only milliseconds, while rare instances have remained stable for years.

When AOM reaches its temporal limit or encounters another disassociation trigger, it undergoes Disassociation - a near-instantaneous degradation process notable for its non-entropic decline of internal bonds, sharply contrasting with conventional decay processes.

Disassociation produces various byproducts, the most common being a whitish-grey, ash-like substance in large flakes. Other observed byproducts include suspensions, oils, water-like liquids, gaseous emanations, cubes of smaller material, and powders. All byproducts continue to decay into progressively smaller fragments until they become unobservable and are theorized to vanish from physical reality entirely. Radiation levels during and after Disassociation are negligible, leading researchers to hypothesize that AOM "exits" observable reality rather than transforming.

### Locality Constraints

AOM stability is tied to proximity to its originating metahuman. If the creator moves beyond a specific radius, Disassociation typically commences. The maximum observed persistence range is approximately 20 kilometers, but most AOM degrades within meters or centimeters of the originator. In many cases, merely losing visual contact is sufficient to trigger degradation, suggesting that psychological factors such as attention and intent influence locality thresholds.

### Materiality Constraints

Energy creation, energy manipulation, and matter manipulation through conventional physical or chemical means fall outside the AOM classification. A pyrokinetic who generates fire by creating a flash-igniting substance produces AOM, while one who manipulates existing matter into combustion does not. Similarly, electrokinetics catalyzing exotic forms of energy are not producing AOM.

### The Vermiform Appendage

First identified in the early 1990s during autopsies of deceased metahumans, the Vermiform Appendage is a small, worm-like organ typically attached to the liver or appendix, believed to play a central role in AOM production.

The organ displays extraordinary regenerative properties, regrowing within days or weeks after damage. However, malformed appendages regrow in the same defective configuration. One documented case involved a civilian metahuman who constantly generated and shed quills due to uncontrollable AOM output.

Surgical removal is strongly discouraged. The organ almost invariably regrows, and its absence renders AOM production uncontrollable rather than suppressing it. As of 2023, experimental pharmacological treatments using vasoconstrictive agents and metabolic inhibitors can "starve" the appendage to reduce AOM output without removal, though these medications carry potential side effects and are reserved for severe cases.

### Medical Considerations

AOM generation is physiologically and psychologically taxing. Common effects include exhaustion, muscle cramps, and cardiovascular strain. AOM-generating metahumans typically require exceptionally high caloric intake, comparable to high-performance athletes or organisms with rapid regenerative capabilities.

Early hypotheses that AOM generation would trigger autoimmune responses have been largely dismissed through empirical research. No harmful environmental residues from AOM degradation have been observed, though monitoring continues. Rare cases of AOM with toxic properties have been documented, causing health issues for the originator or bystanders.

## History

Clarke's 2002 paper established the foundational taxonomy dividing AOM into Standard Constructs and Physics-Defying Constructs. Two years later, Dr. Ivana Price expanded the taxonomy by introducing the Immeasurable Constructs category for AOM that resists analysis due to extreme transience or reactivity.

Also in 2004, Dr. Marina Stellman published "Metahuman Biology and the Genesis of Anomalous Matter," unifying previously disjointed medical observations about AOM-related health effects. Prior to Stellman's work, symptoms experienced by AOM-generating metahumans were often classified as idiopathic conditions.

The Department of Applied Anomalous Sciences (DAAS), founded in 2011 on the outskirts of Baltimore, represents the institutional maturation of AOM research. Its core activities include pairing superhuman researchers with baseline scientists to translate intuitive superhuman creations into reproducible science.

## Implications

In combat and emergency response, AOM's transience demands specialized tactical approaches: constructs must be treated as temporary assets with unpredictable dissolution timelines, and responders must account for AOM structures disassociating without warning.

In scientific research, Physics-Defying Constructs routinely violate Newton's Laws, conservation principles, and thermodynamic laws, driving the creation of entirely new research methodologies.

Medical infrastructure must accommodate AOM-generating metahumans' elevated nutritional requirements, cardiovascular strain, and rare toxic manifestations. Pharmacological interventions targeting the Vermiform Appendage represent an emerging area of metahuman medicine.

The distinction between AOM and exotic energy informs PERKS classification, LUMA licensing, and liability assessment. The DAAS grapples with the legal gray area surrounding "non-replicable anomalous artifacts," as AOM-derived creations raise unresolved intellectual property questions.

In the broader economy, AOM-generating metahumans contribute to industries such as construction, though AOM's transience limits its applications compared to conventional materials.

## Classification / Taxonomy

The AOM taxonomy consists of three major categories:

### Standard Constructs

Materials that mimic the properties of naturally occurring or conventional substances.

| Subcategory | Type | Examples | Key Characteristics |
|-------------|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Natural Mimicry** | Geo-Constructs | Granite, basalt, sandstone | Hardness and durability of natural stone; often molecularly indistinguishable from natural counterparts |
| **Natural Mimicry** | Bio-Constructs | Extra limbs, spider silk, quills | Cellular complexity; common in morphological metahumans |
| **Natural Mimicry** | Metallo-Constructs | Gold, iron, copper analogs | Electrical conductivity, malleability; crystalline structures parallel real metals |
| **Chemically Reactive** | Combustibles | Flash-igniting substances | Follow standard combustion principles; predictable heat and light output |
| **Chemically Reactive** | Inert Constructs | Noble gas analogs, graphite-like materials | Stable and non-reactive; fewer immediate risks |
| **Aggregate State** | Solid Constructs | Hardwood, plastic, concrete analogs | Mechanical properties match real-world equivalents |
| **Aggregate State** | Liquid Constructs | Water, oil, liquid metal analogs | Standard viscosity and surface tension |
| **Aggregate State** | Gaseous Constructs | Air, chlorine gas, ozone analogs | Standard density and compressibility |

### Physics-Defying Constructs

Materials that violate known physical laws.

| Mass-Shifting | Conservation of Mass-Energy | Objects that change weight without changing size |
| Superluminal | Speed of Light Limit | Theoretical only; no observed examples |

### Immeasurable Constructs

AOM that resists meaningful scientific analysis due to extreme transience or reactivity.

| Type | Characteristics |
|------|----------------|
| Instant Reactives | Ignite, freeze, or react near-instantaneously; too brief for chemical analysis |
| High Entropy Constructs | Disintegrate so rapidly that meaningful observation is virtually impossible |
| Vanishing Constructs | Disappear or fundamentally alter upon any form of interaction or observation |
