## Overview

Anomalously Originated Material (AOM) refers to matter spontaneously generated from nothing by metahumans possessing certain abilities, most commonly those classified under the Create (C) category in the PERKS system. Popularly called "Capestuff" or "Exotic Matter," AOM has been a subject of scientific fascination and practical concern since the first recorded instances appeared in the early 1980s, coinciding with the broader emergence of metahuman activity worldwide.

For decades, AOM research was fragmented across disparate disciplines. Biologists, chemists, and physicists each studied isolated examples without a shared vocabulary or organizing framework. This changed in 2002 when Dr. Abraham Clarke published his landmark paper, "Anomalously Originated Materials: Bridging Physics-Defying Manifestations and Exo-Biological Generation," which provided the first unified terminology and classification system. Clarke's work catalyzed an era of interdisciplinary collaboration that continues to define the field.

AOM is distinguished from other metahuman phenomena by its strict definition: it encompasses only spontaneously generated matter, not exotic energy. A pyrokinetic manipulating existing matter through phase changes or chemical reactions does not produce AOM. An electrokinetic generating electricity produces exotic energy, not AOM. The distinction carries practical significance for researchers, policymakers, and emergency responders, as containment and mitigation protocols differ substantially between the two.

## Mechanics

### Temporal Constraints

All AOM is transient. While duration varies widely, empirical research places the median lifespan of AOM at approximately two hours. Duration is governed by a set of factors known as LeBlanc Constants (named after researcher Jacques LeBlanc), which account for variables including the molecular complexity and energy state of the material. Outliers exist at both extremes: some AOM persists for only milliseconds, while rare instances have remained stable for years.

When an AOM sample reaches its temporal limit or encounters another disassociation trigger, it undergoes a rapid degradation process called Disassociation. This process propagates across the material near-instantaneously and is notable for appearing to involve a non-entropic decline of internal bonds, sharply contrasting with conventional physical processes such as decay or dissolution that increase overall entropy.

Disassociation produces various byproducts, the most common being a whitish-grey, ash-like substance that appears in large flakes. Other observed byproducts include suspensions, oils, water-like liquids, gaseous emanations, cubes of smaller material, and powders. All byproducts continue to decay into progressively smaller fragments until they become unobservable and are theorized to vanish from physical reality entirely. Radiation levels during and after Disassociation are negligible, leading researchers to hypothesize that AOM does not transform but rather "exits" observable reality through a mechanism not yet fully understood.

### Locality Constraints

AOM stability is closely tied to proximity to its originating metahuman. If the creator moves beyond a specific radius, Disassociation typically commences. The maximum observed persistence range is approximately 20 kilometers, but most AOM degrades far sooner, often within meters or centimeters of the originator. In many cases, merely losing visual contact with the AOM is sufficient to trigger degradation, and some researchers have suggested that psychological factors such as attention and intent influence locality thresholds.

### Materiality Constraints

AOM is defined strictly as spontaneously generated matter. Energy creation, energy manipulation, and matter manipulation through conventional physical or chemical means fall outside the AOM classification. This distinction is critical: a pyrokinetic who generates fire by creating a flash-igniting substance produces AOM, while one who manipulates existing matter into combustion does not. Similarly, electrokinetics catalyzing exotic forms of energy are not producing AOM.

### The Vermiform Appendage

First identified in the early 1990s during autopsy examinations of deceased metahumans, the Vermiform Appendage is a small, worm-like organ typically attached to the liver or appendix. It is most commonly present in metahumans capable of generating AOM and is believed to play a central role in AOM production.

The organ displays extraordinary regenerative properties, regrowing within days or weeks after damage. However, if a Vermiform Appendage initially forms in a malformed state, it regrows in the same defective configuration. Documented cases of malformed appendages include a civilian metahuman who constantly generated and shed quills in a manner analogous to a porcupine due to uncontrollable AOM output.

Surgical removal of the Vermiform Appendage is strongly discouraged. The organ almost invariably regrows, and its absence does not suppress AOM production but instead renders it uncontrollable, posing significant risk to the individual and their surroundings. As of 2023, experimental pharmacological treatments exist that restrict blood flow and nutrient supply to the appendage using vasoconstrictive agents and metabolic inhibitors, effectively "starving" it to reduce AOM output without removal. These medications carry potential side effects on other organs and are reserved for severe cases.

### Medical Considerations

The generation of AOM is physiologically and psychologically taxing. Common effects include exhaustion, muscle cramps, and in serious cases, cardiovascular strain. AOM-generating metahumans typically require exceptionally high caloric and nutritional intake, comparable to high-performance athletes or organisms with rapid regenerative capabilities.

Early hypotheses that AOM generation would trigger autoimmune responses have been largely dismissed through empirical research, which found no significant increase in autoimmune conditions among AOM-generating metahumans. No harmful environmental residues from AOM degradation have been observed, though monitoring continues as new forms are discovered. Rare cases of AOM with toxic properties have been documented, causing acute or chronic health issues for the originator or bystanders.

## History

AOM was first recorded in the early 1980s, concurrent with the broader emergence of metahuman abilities. For nearly two decades, research into the phenomenon remained scattered and siloed, with scientists from biology, chemistry, and physics studying individual AOM examples in isolation without a shared framework.

The field's watershed moment came in 2002 with the publication of Dr. Abraham Clarke's paper, which established the foundational taxonomy dividing AOM into Standard Constructs and Physics-Defying Constructs. Clarke's interdisciplinary approach provided researchers with common terminology and organizing principles for the first time. Two years later, Dr. Ivana Price expanded Clarke's taxonomy by introducing the Immeasurable Constructs category to account for AOM that resists analysis due to its extreme transience or reactivity.

Also in 2004, Dr. Marina Stellman published "Metahuman Biology and the Genesis of Anomalous Matter," which unified previously disjointed medical observations about AOM-related health effects under a coherent framework. Prior to Stellman's work, the symptoms experienced by AOM-generating metahumans were often classified as idiopathic conditions or poorly understood autoimmune responses.

The Department of Applied Anomalous Sciences (DAAS), founded in 2011 on the outskirts of Baltimore, represents the institutional maturation of AOM research. Among its core activities is the study of AOM produced by Create-type metahumans, pairing superhuman researchers with baseline scientists to translate intuitive superhuman creations into reproducible science.

## Implications

AOM has far-reaching consequences across multiple domains of society. In combat and emergency response, the transient nature of AOM demands specialized tactical approaches: barriers, weapons, and constructs generated by metahumans must be treated as temporary assets with unpredictable dissolution timelines. Emergency responders must account for the possibility that AOM structures providing shelter or containment may disassociate without warning.

In scientific research, AOM represents one of the most profound challenges to conventional physics. Physics-Defying Constructs routinely violate Newton's Laws, conservation principles, and thermodynamic laws, while the Disassociation process itself appears to contradict fundamental assumptions about entropy and the conservation of mass-energy. The field has driven the creation of entirely new research methodologies and interdisciplinary collaborations.

Medical infrastructure must accommodate the specialized needs of AOM-generating metahumans, including elevated nutritional requirements, monitoring for cardiovascular strain, and management of rare toxic manifestations. The development of pharmacological interventions targeting the Vermiform Appendage represents an emerging area of metahuman medicine.

AOM also intersects with regulatory and legal frameworks. The distinction between AOM and exotic energy informs how metahuman abilities are classified under the PERKS system and has implications for LUMA licensing, liability assessment, and emergency response protocols. The DAAS grapples with the legal gray area surrounding "non-replicable anomalous artifacts," as AOM-derived creations raise unresolved intellectual property questions.

In the broader economy, AOM-generating metahumans contribute to industries such as construction, where temporary material generation can accelerate project timelines, though the transient nature of AOM limits its applications compared to conventional materials.

## Classification / Taxonomy

The AOM taxonomy, established by Dr. Abraham Clarke (2002) and expanded by Dr. Ivana Price (2004), consists of three major categories:
