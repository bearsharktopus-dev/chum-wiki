## Overview

The Bellwether District is a 1,300-acre contaminated redevelopment site built on a former refinery in South Philadelphia. A cluster of older buildings on its western edge - not included in official development plans - was used by the Kingdom of Keys as a tainted Jump cutting operation. The contaminated soil kept civilians away, making it an ideal location for illicit activity. Sam traced the tainted Jump supply chain from street-level dealers to this site, and the intelligence she gathered ultimately led to a federal raid that dismantled the operation.

## Key Events

- **Arc 16 - Discovery:** Sam identified the Bellwether District as the source of tainted Jump through her EMT work, mapping geographic patterns of bad drug reactions that radiated outward from the site. She scouted the approaches and identified a bus stop observation point, observing a white van entering the site and not leaving (Chapter 236).
- **Arc 16 - Joint Reconnaissance with Marathon:** On a Saturday night, Marathon - a former Rogue Wave operative tracking defected crew who had flipped to Kingdom - appeared behind Sam at Bellwether with a backpack full of explosives. Sam talked him into joint reconnaissance instead of demolition. They scouted all four buildings: the main cutting operation, storage, an empty building, and sleeping quarters for workers (Chapter 237).
- **Arc 16 - Intelligence Distribution:** Sam distributed Bellwether intelligence across her network - the Auditors, Derek, Councilman Davis, Sundial, Miasma, McNulty and Pattinson's Pals, and Agent Ford of the FBI. Sundial was the first to respond, replying simply with "When and where?" Ford received the full site details through an off-the-books evidence channel (Chapters 237-238).
- **Arc 16 - Federal Raid:** Within 24 hours of receiving Sam's intelligence, federal authorities raided the Bellwether site. Sixteen people were detained, drug equipment was seized, and 12 IEDs - Marathon's pipe bombs, planted without Sam's knowledge - were recovered, bringing ATF involvement and adding explosives charges to the Kingdom case. The Inquirer's Anthony Robinson connected the raid to an earlier financial expose (Chapter 242).
