## Overview

The PES refinery is the abandoned remains of the Philadelphia Energy Solutions facility in Southwest Philadelphia, which suffered an explosion in 2018. Now decaying behind chain-link fences and warning signs, the refinery holds deep significance for the Delaware Valley Defenders - it is both the site where Chernobyl killed Professor Franklin years before the main story and the location where Liberty Belle made her final stand. Belle spent weeks planting surveillance equipment at the refinery, anticipating Chernobyl's return, before confronting him there on the first night of Hanukkah.

## Key Events

- **Pre-Story - Professor Franklin's Death:** Chernobyl killed Professor Franklin at the PES refinery in an incident that predates the main narrative. The radiation from this encounter also gave Liberty Belle terminal cancer.
- **Arc 3 - Belle's Surveillance:** On Thanksgiving night, Sam followed Liberty Belle to the PES refinery, where Belle was setting up surveillance cameras and bugs. Over the following weeks, Belle made multiple return visits to maintain and weatherproof her surveillance equipment, preparing for a confrontation she was certain would come (Chapters 42-43).
- **Arc 3 - Liberty Belle's Death:** Belle confronted Chernobyl at the PES refinery on the first night of Hanukkah. Sam disobeyed evacuation orders and followed Belle to the refinery, recording Chernobyl's monologue about his government energy deal and his accusations that Belle was haunted by Franklin's dybbuk. Belle was killed in the fight. East Coast heroes from Atlantic City, Camden, Trenton, DC, and NYC gathered afterward to mourn (Chapters 44-45).
- **Arc 6 - The Handwritten Note:** During the Sideshow arc, Caldwell introduced a handwritten note allegedly from Belle inviting Chernobyl to meet at the PES refinery on the night of their confrontation, reading "PES Refinery. 12/7. Sundown. Finish this." Sam acknowledged the handwriting appeared authentic. If genuine, it reframes Belle's death as something she deliberately initiated (Chapter 95).
