## Overview

Aurora Springs Residential Facility is a specialized containment community operated by the National Superhuman Response Agency (NSRA) for individuals whose superhuman abilities present significant risks to public safety but who have not committed any criminal offenses. Situated on over 15,000 acres of government-owned land in the Colorado mountains, the facility is designed to function as a self-contained residential community rather than a correctional institution. Its residents are formally classified as residents, not inmates, and the facility's charter explicitly distinguishes it from prisons such as Daedalus Correctional Facility.

The facility's stated mission rests on three pillars: ensuring resident safety through non-intrusive security measures, promoting physical and psychological well-being through comprehensive healthcare and mental health services, and providing a high standard of living through comfortable accommodations and varied amenities. Aurora Springs also serves as a site for ongoing dynological research, facilitating the study and potential mitigation of volatile superhuman abilities through individualized power control training programs.

Funding is appropriated from the United States Defense Budget under a special provision for national security initiatives involving superhuman entities. An internal financial committee, overseen by a Department of Defense representative, reviews the annual budget, and the facility is subject to both internal and external financial audits. Aurora Springs is notable within the broader context of superhuman policy as a source of controversy; some unregistered powered individuals actively avoid LUMA registration specifically to prevent being referred to the facility.

## Physical Description

Aurora Springs occupies a vast tract of pristine mountain terrain, with over 500 acres designated as accessible open space for residents. The grounds include more than 50 miles of maintained walking and biking trails, three stocked fishing lakes, designated bird-watching areas, personal garden plots, and guided nature tour routes. A sky observation deck equipped with high-powered telescopes is available for stargazing.

Accommodations fall into two categories. Dormitory-style housing is available for residents who prefer a communal atmosphere; each individual dormitory unit contains an Olympic Queen-sized bed, private bathroom, kitchenette, couch, and electronic entertainment options, with access to spacious communal lounges, dining areas, activity centers, fitness areas, and shared outdoor spaces. For residents requiring greater isolation, private cabins offer full kitchens, private bathrooms, bedrooms, and living areas, with up to 200 acres of surrounding fenced land per cabin depending on the resident's containment needs.

Common areas feature panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows, acoustic treatments, calming color schemes, and natural lighting designed to minimize stress. Each residence includes an outdoor patio or balcony with mountain views. The facility also contains specialized reinforced wings and training areas designed to withstand various superhuman abilities, including materials resistant to molecular destabilization and environments tailored to individual power profiles. Surveillance and monitoring systems operate throughout the facility, including biometric bracelets worn by residents that continuously track physiological indicators and stress levels.

## History

Aurora Springs was formally established by charter on September 15, 2012, signed by Facility Director Dr. Emily Thompson and General Mike Mitchell as the NSRA representative. Construction began shortly thereafter and was expected to be completed in early 2014. The facility was conceived to address a gap in superhuman management policy: individuals whose uncontrolled abilities posed genuine public safety threats but who had not broken any laws had no appropriate placement option prior to Aurora Springs. Conventional containment in correctional facilities was deemed both legally and ethically inappropriate for non-criminal individuals.

The facility's charter established its governance structure, including direct oversight by an NSRA-appointed Facility Director, an independent advisory board comprising legal experts, ethicists, and superhuman studies scholars, and an elected Resident Council to represent the interests of the resident population. Admission criteria require a referral from the NSRA, the Department of Defense, or other relevant federal agencies, followed by a thorough risk assessment encompassing medical, psychological, and legal evaluations.

Since becoming operational, Aurora Springs has developed extensive programming around power control training, mental health support, continuing education, and social reintegration planning. The facility conducts quarterly reviews of each resident's status, allowing appeals for changes in residency classification. Its operations are reviewed annually by the NSRA and the advisory board, and amendments to the charter may be proposed by the Facility Director, advisory board, or Resident Council, subject to NSRA approval.

## In the Story

Aurora Springs has not yet appeared directly in the main narrative chapters. It is referenced in the factsheet as a containment facility within the broader superhuman support infrastructure and is noted as a reason some powered individuals in the underground network avoid LUMA registration. Two in-universe documents provide detailed information about the facility: a welcome brochure and charter intended for incoming residents, and an academic case study examining daily life at the facility through the experience of resident Emily Chen.

## Trivia

- The facility explicitly avoids correctional language; staff never refer to residents as "inmates" or "prisoners," and the environment is designed to resemble a gated community rather than a prison.
- Residents can maintain academic careers through secure, monitored connections to outside educational institutions. Emily Chen, for example, continues computational biochemistry research with her former university.
- Custom hazard suits can be fabricated for residents whose powers can be safely contained, allowing physical interaction with visiting family members and even extended stays in resident cabins.
- The welcome brochure's tone is notably upbeat and hospitality-oriented, framing the facility as a community and sanctuary, though the charter and case study reveal the underlying tension between comfort and involuntary containment.
- Some residents in the underground network of unregistered powered individuals specifically cite fear of Aurora Springs detention as a primary reason for avoiding LUMA registration.
- The facility offers financial grants to help families and friends from underprivileged backgrounds visit residents.
- Regular monitored off-site excursions to nearby malls, museums, and other attractions are provided to residents.
