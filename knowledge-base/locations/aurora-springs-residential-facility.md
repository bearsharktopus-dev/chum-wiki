## Overview

Aurora Springs is a specialized containment community operated by the NSRA for individuals whose superhuman abilities present significant public safety risks but who have not committed criminal offenses. Situated on over 15,000 acres of government land in the Colorado mountains, the facility is designed as a self-contained residential community rather than a correctional institution. Residents are formally classified as residents, not inmates, and the charter explicitly distinguishes it from prisons such as Daedalus.

The facility's mission centers on three pillars: resident safety through non-intrusive security, physical and psychological well-being through comprehensive healthcare, and a high standard of living through comfortable accommodations and amenities. Aurora Springs also serves as a dynological research site, facilitating study and potential mitigation of volatile abilities through individualized power control training. Some unregistered powered individuals actively avoid LUMA registration specifically to prevent being referred here.

## Physical Description

The grounds include over 500 acres of accessible open space, 50+ miles of maintained trails, three stocked fishing lakes, bird-watching areas, personal garden plots, guided nature tours, and a sky observation deck with high-powered telescopes.

**Dormitory housing** provides an Olympic Queen-sized bed, private bathroom, kitchenette, couch, and entertainment, with access to communal lounges, dining areas, activity centers, fitness areas, and shared outdoor spaces. **Private cabins** offer full kitchens, bedrooms, and living areas, with up to 200 acres of surrounding fenced land depending on containment needs.

Common areas feature panoramic windows, acoustic treatments, calming color schemes, and natural lighting. Each residence includes an outdoor patio or balcony with mountain views. Specialized reinforced wings and training areas withstand various abilities, including materials resistant to molecular destabilization and environments tailored to individual power profiles. Biometric bracelets continuously track physiological indicators and stress levels.

## History

Aurora Springs was formally chartered on September 15, 2012, signed by Facility Director Dr. Emily Thompson and General Mike Mitchell (NSRA representative). It addressed a gap in superhuman policy: individuals whose uncontrolled abilities threatened public safety but who had broken no laws had no appropriate placement option. Correctional facilities were deemed legally and ethically inappropriate.

The charter established governance through an NSRA-appointed Director, an independent advisory board (legal experts, ethicists, superhuman studies scholars), and an elected Resident Council. Admission requires a referral from the NSRA, DoD, or other federal agencies, followed by medical, psychological, and legal risk assessment. Quarterly reviews allow appeals for residency classification changes. The charter can be amended by the Director, advisory board, or Resident Council, subject to NSRA approval.

Funding is appropriated from the Defense Budget under a special provision for national security initiatives. An internal financial committee overseen by a DoD representative reviews the annual budget, subject to internal and external audits.

## In the Story

Aurora Springs is first mentioned during a Young Defenders briefing about Chernobyl (Illya Fedorov), where Liberty Belle describes it as a federal facility offering a comfortable lifestyle and visits from loved ones. Chernobyl refuses, valuing freedom above all else.

Following Fedorov's sentencing in Book 7, his defense argues for Aurora Springs placement rather than Daedalus or Ixion - if Deathgirl (a power copier at Daedalus) contacted Fedorov, she could copy his radiation powers without protective equipment. He is ultimately sent there, and by Book 8 is reported settling in peacefully, with Mrs. Gibson keeping Sam updated.

During the Daedalus prison break arc, a possible Aurora Springs transfer is mentioned for Daisy Zhen's rehabilitation. In Book 15, Sam wonders whether Aurora Springs is investigating Vysera (a power-suppression drug in clinical trials). By Book 16, Rachel Small's Parents of Powered Kids coalition has connected with three parents whose children are housed there.

Two in-universe documents provide detailed background: a welcome brochure for incoming residents and an academic case study examining daily life through resident Emily Chen's experience.

## Trivia

- Residents can maintain academic careers through secure, monitored connections to outside institutions. Emily Chen continues computational biochemistry research with her former university.
- Custom hazard suits can be fabricated for residents whose powers can be safely contained, allowing physical interaction with visiting family.
- The welcome brochure's upbeat, hospitality-oriented tone contrasts with the charter and case study's underlying tension between comfort and involuntary containment.
- The facility offers financial grants to help underprivileged families visit residents.
- Regular monitored off-site excursions to malls, museums, and other attractions are provided.
