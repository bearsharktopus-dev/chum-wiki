## Overview

The Whitford Institute is the premier - and only - specialized therapeutic residential facility for powered youth ages 12 to 17 in the United States. Founded in 2017 by Dr. Eleanor Whitford to address a critical gap in mental health services for metahuman minors, the facility integrates psychiatric care, ability coaching, and comprehensive education within a residential setting. The campus is organized into four wings with private or semi-private rooms, communal areas, and specialized ability-appropriate features. Staff members include individuals who themselves possess enhanced abilities.

## Key Events

- **Arc 13 - Daisy Zhen's Placement:** After Daisy Zhen escaped from the Daedalus prison break and reached her parents in Albany, attorney Patricia Gilly secured her placement at the Whitford Institute over federal custody in an emergency hearing before Judge Esposito. Dr. Olivia Reed coordinated Daisy's transfer to Chicago. Her parents Wei and Xiuying Zhen pledged to relocate to Chicago to be near her. Notably, the Red Calf operative Tarbaby had placed a tracker on Daisy during the extraction, meaning Red Calf can locate her at the Whitford Institute whenever it chooses (Interlude DZ.3).
- **Arc 14 - Mentorship Model:** Councilman Davis referenced the Whitford Institute as a model for his proposed mentorship program at the Tacony Community Center, noting that while Whitford is the ideal, it is expensive and exclusive (Chapter 211).
- **Arc 14-15 - Jasmine Walker:** Jasmine Walker, a fifteen-year-old chlorokinetic, spent three months at the Whitford Institute before being transferred to Philadelphia and joining the Tacony Community Center mentorship program. Jasmine later revealed that Whitford focused primarily on safety and containment rather than helping her understand or control her abilities - "Nobody ever asked what I wanted to do with my life" (Chapters 215, 222).
