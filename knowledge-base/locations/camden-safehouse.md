## Overview

The Camden safehouse is a building in Camden, New Jersey, that serves as Rogue Wave's primary operational base. It features a repurposed kitchen functioning as an infirmary and a communal living area where team members debrief, strategize, and spend downtime. The safehouse is one of several locations Rogue Wave maintains across Philadelphia and Camden, but it serves as the organization's most consistently used headquarters under Monkey Business's leadership.

## Key Events

- **Arc 12 - Rush Order's Recovery:** After Dean Carver's South Street fight with Sam Small, he is brought to the Camden safehouse for medical treatment. Snake Oil and Chimera tend to his gunshot wound and facial lacerations. The team discusses the fight and the "Gun Dad" incident, with Dead Drop and Jackpot returning with Chinese food. Dead Drop stands by the door in tactical gear during the debrief (Arc 12).
- **Arc 15 - Mr. Polygraph Extraction:** Sam tips Rush Order about Kingdom evidence disposal at Roxborough Memorial Hospital. Rogue Wave conducts a multi-day stakeout followed by a combat extraction of Mr. Polygraph. Back at the Camden safehouse, Snake Oil extracts Polygraph's lie-detection power - a 90-second agonizing process that produces a blue-green luminescent crystal. Monkey Business demands the crystal be processed into Fly immediately. Polygraph is dumped at a police station, permanently depowered. During the operation, Jackpot is observed playing Mario Kart against Dead Drop (and losing badly) at the safehouse (Arc 15).
- **Intermission 15.5:** Rush Order and Dead Drop debrief at the Camden safehouse following the Maya Richardson rooftop encounter (Interlude DC.3).
