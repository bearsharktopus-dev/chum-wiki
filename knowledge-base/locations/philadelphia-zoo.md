## Overview

The Philadelphia Zoo became a key location in the Kingdom of Keys' operations when it was identified as one of several marked locations on a map Sam discovered during her Crescent nightclub infiltration in Arc 8. Sam conducted weeks of solo surveillance at the zoo, building a relationship with a zookeeper named Mack while watching for signs of the Kingdom's move. The zoo was ultimately the site of Operation Ivory, a multi-layered heist that used a spectacular dinosaur rampage as cover for a targeted theft of poison dart frogs.

## Key Events

- **Arc 8 - Surveillance:** Sam and Tasha investigate the zoo after discovering it on the Kingdom's marked-locations map. During a visit, they unexpectedly encounter Dr. Trinh-Norwood (Mrs. Xenograft), who engages Sam in a civil conversation about animals, reveals she is wearing a wire, and warns Sam to be careful (Chapter 126).
- **Arc 8 - Operation Ivory:** On a snowy December day, the Kingdom launches its attack. Mr. T-Rex transforms into dinosaur form and destroys the rhino enclosure, creating mass chaos and taking hostages. The Delaware Valley Defenders deploy - Captain Plasma strikes Mr. T-Rex at supersonic speed, with Fury Forge and Crossroads also engaging. Sam realizes the dinosaur rampage is a distraction: the real heist targets specific wild-caught poison dart frogs in the Reptile House, whose toxins are needed for drug synthesis. Sam confronts Mr. Nothing, Mrs. Heartbeat, and Mudslide in the Reptile House. Mr. Nothing neutralizes her powers through touch, but Maggie arrives wearing Sam's stolen bulletproof vest and saves her. In the ensuing fight, Maggie is shot multiple times (the vest saves her life), and Bulwark suffers a broken arm. Mr. Nothing and Mudslide are captured, but Mrs. Heartbeat escapes with some of the frogs and Mr. T-Rex flees with followers (Chapters 133-135).
- **Arc 9:** A 1960s flashback shows young Victor Blanc connecting with the silverback gorilla at the zoo (Interlude VB.1).
