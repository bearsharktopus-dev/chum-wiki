## Overview

The Van Kirk and James construction site is an unfinished construction area in Northeast Philadelphia that Sam Small deliberately chose as the location for her confrontation with Shrike (Niles Nolan). The site featured steel beams, concrete foundations, and minimal walls - providing good sight lines from surrounding auto yards and the highway while limiting the surfaces Shrike could use to generate his metal spikes. The battle that took place here became a media spectacle, with Shrike's skinhead followers forming a perimeter and news coverage broadcasting the events.

## Key Events

- **Arc 14 - Invitation:** After Shrike broke into the Small family home and delivered his ultimatum, Sam and the Auditors selected the Van Kirk construction site for its tactical advantages against Shrike's metallokinetic powers. Sam left an invitation at the Metropolitan Opera House specifying the location (Chapters 206-207).
- **Arc 14 - First Fight:** Sam engaged Shrike at the construction site, using shuffle footwork to avoid ground spikes and deploying Instant Armor on her forearms. She knocked Shrike unconscious and he was taken into NSRA custody (Chapter 208).
- **Arc 14 - Shrike's Escape and Death:** A gunfight between Shrike's skinhead followers and police allowed Shrike to break free from the NSRA containment vehicle. He injected Hypeman and engaged Sam in a second, more brutal round of fighting. Sam entered a dissociative berserker state and manifested full-body Instant Armor for the first time. Shrike died approximately one hour after hospitalization from accumulated injuries and Hypeman's effects. Two of his skinhead followers were killed by police during the confrontation (Chapters 208-209).
- **Arc 14 - Bulwark's Injury:** Lily Chen called the DVD for backup during the battle. Bulwark and Fury Forge deployed to the site. Bulwark was critically injured and hospitalized in the ICU when Shrike broke free from the containment vehicle while on Hypeman. Fury Forge was also injured, later seen on crutches (Chapters 208-209).
