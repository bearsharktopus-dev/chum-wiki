## Overview

South Street is a well-known Philadelphia street that serves as a recurring location for major superhuman confrontations throughout the story. The street was fully evacuated and cordoned off for the Young Defenders' operation against the Philly Phreaks in Arc 3, and later became the site of a chaotic public battle between Sam Small and Rush Order in Arc 12. Its visibility and central location have made fights there particularly consequential for public perception of superheroes and vigilantes.

## Key Events

- **Arc 1:** Sam and Gale patrol the South Street rooftops together, with Sam testing the range and utility of her blood sense from elevation (Arc 1).
- **Arc 3 - Philly Phreaks Confrontation:** The Young Defenders are dispatched to South Street to confront the Philly Phreaks after an anonymous tip from Spindle. The battle reveals Deathgirl as the Phreaks' secret weapon - a twelve-year-old power copier who duplicates and amplifies multiple heroes' abilities in succession, including Puppeteer's strings, Gale's wind, and Bloodhound's regeneration. Spindle betrays the Phreaks during the fight, helping to capture Patches. Chrysalis and Pumice flee, and Deathgirl escapes through a storm drain (Arc 3).
- **Arc 12 - Sam vs. Rush Order:** Sam tracks Elias Franklin's trail through Point Breeze to a warehouse near South Street, leading to a public confrontation with Rush Order. The fight becomes a spectacle with bystander crowds and drones filming. Benjamin Small arrives and shoots Rush Order in the left shoulder; Rush Order shoots Ben in the right thigh, narrowly missing the femoral artery. The "Gun Dad" video goes viral. Rush Order later recovers at the Camden safehouse, and Ben requires surgery and extended rehabilitation (Arc 12).
