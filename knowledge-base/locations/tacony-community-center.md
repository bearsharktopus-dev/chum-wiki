## Overview

The Tacony Community Center began as the Tacony Music Hall, leased by Sam Small as the Auditors' operational headquarters. Under landlord Mr. Feldman - who was aware of and supportive of the team's vigilante activities - the Music Hall served as a base for mission planning, secure communications, costume storage, and team meetings throughout Books 11-13.

The transformation was proposed by Councilman Jamal Davis on Halloween night 2025 (Chapter 211), following Sam's retirement from the Bloodhound identity. Davis presented blueprints drawn by John Horvath (Pop-pop Moe's business partner at Horvath-Small Ltd.) for a comprehensive renovation funded by unused "metahuman youth initiatives" budget allocations. Davis's proposal was an explicit critique of the existing superhero system - the Young Defenders trained children as soldiers, and comic book culture normalized violence as the only meaningful contribution powered youth could make. The community center was designed as a systemic alternative.

## Physical Description

The renovated building retains the original Music Hall structure with significant upgrades:

- **Ground Floor:** Front desk (staffed by Patricia, formerly of a Kensington women's shelter), group meeting rooms, therapy rooms, kitchenette
- **Second Floor:** Group rooms, additional therapy spaces, beds for overnight stays (halfway house function)
- **Faraday Cage Room:** Federally rated copper mesh; used for secure communications, team briefings, Maxwell's precognitive sessions, and Sam's therapy breakthroughs
- **Rooftop:** Accessible via master key; used for surveillance and entry/exit
- **Security:** Motion sensors, secure communications infrastructure

Designed by John Horvath with institutional durability in mind.

## History

### Music Hall Era (Books 11-13)

Sam secured the lease through Mr. Feldman during Book 11. Jordan Westwood transferred all Auditors leadership and Music Hall administration to Sam before departing for MIT. The building served as headquarters for the Kingdom of Keys investigation, secure Faraday room communications, and Sam's recovery from various injuries.

During Book 13, the Small family evacuated their spike-seeded home after Shrike's invasion and took refuge at the Music Hall, using it as a staging ground for the confrontation with Shrike.

### Transition and Destruction (Book 14)

On Halloween night, Davis arrived with Horvath's blueprints and his comprehensive conversion proposal. The mentorship program launched shortly after, with early sessions at the Music Hall and Franklin Park.

Later in Book 14 (Chapters 217-218), Kingdom enforcer "Garbage Day" attacked the Music Hall - destroying equipment, tearing through walls with structural manipulation powers, and dislocating Tasha's shoulder - as retaliation for the team's investigation into Councilman Silverstein's Kingdom connections. The damage left the building unusable, but renovation proceeded through Books 14-15, funded by unused metahuman youth initiative budgets.

### Grand Opening and Operations (Book 16)

The grand opening in early February 2026 (Chapter 233) featured Davis delivering a speech indicting the child-soldier pipeline, attended briefly by Maya Richardson. Sam received master keys (office, Faraday room, rooftop) and the title "associate program coordinator."

Active programs by late Book 16:

- **Mentorship program:** Powered youth including Zara Khan, Liam O'Connor, Alex Kirby, and Jasmine Walker; training at Franklin Park and library meetings
- **Jump harm reduction:** Walk-in services for drug users and families
- **Parent support groups:** For families of powered children
- **Career services and vocational training**
- **EMT coordination:** Integrated with Sam's emergency medical work

## In the Story

The building's arc mirrors Sam's transformation. As the Music Hall, it was a covert base for teenage vigilantes - functional but precarious, dependent on one landlord's goodwill. As the Tacony Community Center, it becomes a legitimate institution with public funding, professional staff, and a mission beyond combat.

The center's most significant narrative function is proving that systems can work without Sam personally being present. When Songbirds mobilize at the center during Book 16, Lily handles the protest independently with a meteor hammer demonstration and no violence. Patterson functions as the center's authority. The mentorship kids continue to grow. This is the evidence that makes Sam's "load-bearing life" thesis work - she built something that operates even when she's not there.

The Faraday room serves as a recurring emotional and operational focal point: Maxwell's coin-flip precognition sessions, Auditors briefings, Sam's breakdown ("All 'retired' means is I'm doing it alone"), and the Ford phone call that triggered the Bellwether federal raid all take place within its walls.

## Trivia

- The renovation was designed by John Horvath, whose firm (Horvath-Small Ltd.) also designed Daedalus Correctional Facility - connecting the community center's origin to the prison that failed the people it was built to contain.
- Jennifer Patterson's signature critique of Sam - the "soccer player" speech - asks how many athletes still play at 30, arguing that sustainability requires building a career, not burning out in thirteen years.
