## Overview

The Tacony Community Center began as the Tacony Music Hall, a building leased by Sam Small as the Auditors' operational headquarters. Under the landlord Mr. Feldman - who was aware of and supportive of the team's vigilante activities - the Music Hall served as a base for mission planning, secure communications, costume storage, and team meetings throughout Books 11–13.

The transformation into a community center was proposed by Councilman Jamal Davis on Halloween night 2025 (Chapter 211), following Sam's retirement from the Bloodhound identity. Davis presented blueprints drawn by John Horvath (Pop-pop Moe's business partner at Horvath-Small Ltd.) for a comprehensive renovation: halfway house beds, classroom spaces, counseling rooms, and vocational training workshops, funded by unused "metahuman youth initiatives" budget allocations. Davis's proposal represented an explicit critique of the existing superhero system - the Young Defenders had trained children as soldiers, and comic book culture had normalized violence as the only meaningful contribution powered youth could make. The community center was designed as a systemic alternative.

By Book 16, the Tacony Community Center has become a functioning institution: mentorship program for powered youth, Jump addiction harm reduction walk-ins, parent support groups, career services, and EMT coordination. Its grand opening featured a speech by Davis indicting the child-soldier pipeline and was attended (briefly) by Maya Richardson. Jennifer Patterson, a director with over twenty years of youth services experience, runs daily operations and serves as the center's moral backbone.

## Physical Description

The renovated building retains the original Music Hall structure while incorporating significant upgrades:

- **Ground Floor:** Front desk (staffed by Patricia, formerly of a Kensington women's shelter), group meeting rooms, therapy rooms, kitchenette
- **Second Floor:** Renovated group rooms, additional therapy spaces, beds for overnight stays (halfway house function)
- **Faraday Cage Room:** Federally rated copper mesh; used for secure communications, team briefings, and Maxwell's precognitive sessions
- **Rooftop:** Accessible via master key; used for surveillance and as an entry/exit point
- **Security:** Motion sensors, secure communications infrastructure

The building was designed by John Horvath with institutional durability in mind. The Faraday room in particular serves dual purposes - secure enough for intelligence work, isolated enough for Sam's therapy breakthroughs.

## History

### Music Hall Era (Books 11–13)

Sam secured the lease on the Tacony Music Hall through Mr. Feldman during Book 11. Jordan Westwood transferred all Auditors leadership and Music Hall administration to Sam before departing for MIT. The building served as the team's headquarters for operations including the Kingdom of Keys investigation, secure communication via the Faraday room, and Sam's recovery from various injuries.

During Book 13, the Small family evacuated their spike-seeded home after Shrike's invasion and took refuge at the Music Hall. It served as their temporary residence and the staging ground for the confrontation with Shrike.

### Destruction and Renovation (Books 14–15)

In Book 14 (Chapter 217), a Kingdom enforcer called "Garbage Day" attacked the Music Hall, destroying laptops and equipment, tearing through walls with structural manipulation powers, and dislocating Tasha's shoulder. The attack was calculated retaliation for the team's investigation into Councilman Silverstein's Kingdom connections.

Despite the destruction, the attack catalyzed transformation. On Halloween night (Chapter 211), Councilman Davis arrived with renovation blueprints and a comprehensive proposal to convert the damaged building into a community center. The renovation proceeded through Books 14–15, funded by unused metahuman youth initiative budgets. Sam's fugitive operations during Book 15 continued to use the building even as renovation work progressed.

### Grand Opening and Operations (Book 16)

The Tacony Community Center held its grand opening in early February 2026 (Chapter 233). Davis delivered a speech explicitly indicting the child-soldier superhero pipeline. Sam received master keys for the office, Faraday room, and rooftop access. Her title became "associate program coordinator" - an institutional role rather than a vigilante one.

By late Book 16, the center operates multiple programs:
- **Mentorship program:** Six powered youth (Zara Khan, Liam O'Connor, Alex Kirby, Jasmine Walker, Lyle, and others), with power-training sessions at Franklin Park and library meetings
- **Jump harm reduction:** Walk-in services for drug users and their families
- **Parent support groups:** Sessions for families of powered children
- **Career services and vocational training**
- **EMT coordination:** Integrated with Sam's emergency medical work

## In the Story

The building's arc mirrors Sam's own transformation. As the Music Hall, it was a covert base for teenage vigilantes - functional but precarious, dependent on one landlord's goodwill and one teenager's lease. The Kingdom's attack destroyed it physically, but the destruction created the opportunity for Davis's institutional vision. As the Tacony Community Center, it becomes something the Music Hall never was: a legitimate institution with public funding, professional staff, and a mission that extends beyond combat.

The center's most significant narrative function is proving that systems can work without Sam personally being present. When Songbirds mobilize at the center during a coordinated attack in Book 16, Lily handles the protest independently with a meteor hammer demonstration and no violence. Mrs. Patterson functions as the center's authority. The mentorship kids continue to grow. This is the evidence that makes Sam's "load-bearing life" thesis work - she built something that operates even when she's not there.

The Faraday room in particular serves as a recurring emotional and operational focal point: Maxwell's coin-flip precognition sessions, Auditors briefings, Sam's breakdown ("All 'retired' means is I'm doing it alone"), and the Ford phone call that triggered the Bellwether federal raid all take place within its copper mesh walls.

## Trivia

- The building was attacked by "Garbage Day" in Book 14 - a Kingdom enforcer with structural manipulation powers who tore through walls as calculated retaliation for the Silverstein investigation.
- Sam's master key set (office, Faraday room, rooftop access) was presented during the grand opening ceremony.
- The renovation was designed by John Horvath, the same engineer whose firm (Horvath-Small Ltd.) designed Daedalus Correctional Facility - connecting the community center's origin to the prison that failed the very people it was built to contain.
- Davis frames the center as a direct counter to the child-soldier superhero pipeline, explicitly naming the Young Defenders as an example of a system that trained powered youth for combat rather than personal development.
- Jennifer Patterson's signature critique of Sam - the "soccer player" speech - asks how many athletes still play at 30, arguing that sustainability requires building a career, not burning out in thirteen years.
