## Overview

Tremont & Fairfax is one of New York City's largest law megafirms. One of its named partners is the grand-uncle of Trent Fairfax, who secretly leads the Kingdom of Keys under the codename Mr. Antithesis. Fairfax uses his family connection to the firm as part of his public cover identity, presenting himself as the unremarkable lesser scion of a prominent legal family - a freewheeling financial investor too inconsequential to attract attention. The firm itself handles a statistically outsized number of superhuman defense cases, and its attorneys have been connected to multiple Kingdom-adjacent legal matters, though individual lawyers like Katherine Huang appear to be genuinely unaware of the Kingdom connection.

## Key Events

- **Arc 10 - Discovery:** During Aaron McKinley's trial, Sam overhears that his defense is funded by "concerned citizens for due process" through Tremont & Fairfax. The Auditors investigate his defense attorney Katherine Huang and the firm, uncovering connections to the Kingdom of Keys and Stheno Pharmaceuticals. Junior partner Martin Calloway is identified as the incorporator of Stheno Pharmaceuticals (Arc 10).
- **Arc 11 - Investigation Deepens:** Sam details the Tremont & Fairfax to Stheno pipeline during a consultation with private investigators at Chambers & Woo. The Auditors build an intelligence case connecting the firm's legal work to the Kingdom's corporate infrastructure (Arc 11).
- **Arc 12 - Argus Corps Connection:** Katherine Huang appears on Argus Corps legal paperwork, revealing that Tremont & Fairfax represented both Aaron McKinley's defense and Maya Richardson's Argus Corps superhero team. This dual representation becomes key evidence in the Auditors' investigation of Councilwoman Richardson's Kingdom connections. Patriot and Turbo Jett independently begin background-checking the firm (Arc 12).
- **Intermission 15.5 - Trent Fairfax's Background:** Trent Fairfax's interludes reveal his connection to the firm through his grand-uncle. He also operates through a secondary front, Alcott & Associates, for philanthropy and prison visits under attorney-client privilege - including recruiting Aaron McKinley as "Mr. Prometheus" (Intermission 15.5).
