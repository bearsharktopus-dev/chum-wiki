## Overview

Chambers & Woo Investigations is a private investigation firm where former Young Defenders Akilah Washington (Puppeteer/Marionette) and Devonte Harris (Playback/Ventriloquist) work after leaving the superhero team. The firm handles cape-adjacent investigation work and has become a key intelligence resource for Sam Small's investigation into the Kingdom of Keys, providing expertise in surveillance, evidence analysis, encryption, counter-surveillance protocols, and legal documentation.

## Key Events

- **Arc 11 - Kingdom Data Consultation:** Sam's parents accompanied her to Chambers & Woo to consult with Akilah and Devonte about encrypted Kingdom files. Jordan participated remotely. Devonte explained the AES-256 encryption on the data, while Akilah proposed finding a technolect to assist. Sam detailed the Tremont & Fairfax to Stheno Pharmaceuticals pipeline, and the PIs agreed to investigate pro bono. Jordan transferred approximately 200 GB of Kingdom-related data to the Chambers & Woo server (Chapters 167-168).
- **Arc 11 - Operation Soot:** Akilah and Devonte participated in the fake death operation from the Bridge, with Akilah's telekinetic strings and Devonte's sound-stealing abilities proving essential to the deception's success (Chapter 175).
- **Arc 16 - Ongoing Reputation:** Sam's EMT partner Hector independently recommended Chambers & Woo, specifically mentioning a junior detective named Washington who "has a nose on her." Sam internally noted that she already knew Akilah but did not reveal the connection (Chapters 236, 243).
