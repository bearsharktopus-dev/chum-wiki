## Overview

Daedalus Correctional Facility is the first prison in the United States designed and constructed specifically to incarcerate superhuman individuals. Funded through the national defense budget and built to address the mounting failures of conventional maximum-security prisons, it represents a paradigm shift in correctional architecture. The facility combines advanced materials science, AI-driven surveillance, behavioral psychology, and a modular containment system to house inmates whose abilities range from electromagnetic manipulation to intangibility.

The facility's design philosophy rests on the principle that containment does not necessitate cruelty. Rather than relying solely on brute-force barriers, Daedalus employs a layered approach that integrates human engineering, redundant security systems, and individualized containment protocols. Its modular design allows staff to tailor each cell block to the specific powers of its occupants, making the prison a continuously adaptive institution rather than a static structure.

Daedalus serves as the prototype for a planned network of superhuman containment facilities across the country. Lessons learned from its construction and early operations directly inform the design of its sister facilities: the Sisyphus Detention Center (under construction in Southern California), the Tantalus Detention Center, and the Ixion Correctional Facility (both in planning stages).

## Physical Description

Daedalus is built on shock-absorbent foundations inspired by cutting-edge earthquake-resistant architecture, enabling the structure to withstand both natural disasters and superhuman-induced seismic events. The facility's walls incorporate advanced composite materials layered in intricate combinations, selected for their ability to nullify or resist specific superhuman abilities. Certain zones feature non-conductive polymer mesh to deter electrical-based powers, while others utilize specially treated glass capable of diffusing and weakening energy-based attacks.

The internal layout follows the Panopticon principle, with angles and sightlines meticulously planned to give inmates a persistent sense of observation. Color schemes are selected for their empirically demonstrated calming effects, and the floor plan is deliberately disorienting to unauthorized navigation, discouraging escape attempts through spatial confusion alone. Spaces are configured to prevent congregation and potential plotting among inmates.

The containment system is built around a modular architecture. Individual modules can be configured, disassembled, and reassembled in layered combinations to create bespoke containment for a wide variety of powers. One module might negate electromagnetic abilities while another monitors and contains intangibility. This scalable approach eliminates the need for costly full-facility redesigns as new inmates arrive.

Surveillance at Daedalus goes well beyond conventional cameras. Sensors distributed throughout the facility detect unusual heat signatures, sudden air pressure changes, and micro-vibrations -- all potential indicators of covert superhuman activity. An AI-driven analytics system processes sensor data in real time, flagging anomalies and alerting security teams immediately. Biometric authentication restricts access to critical areas, mitigating risks posed by shape-shifters or appearance-altering powers. A dedicated lighting system minimizes shadows and dark corners, supported by infrared surveillance to counter inmates with shadow manipulation or invisibility capabilities.

Redundancy is a core design philosophy. If a surveillance camera fails, motion detectors and thermal sensors compensate. If a barrier is breached, automated lockdown protocols seal affected sections of the prison. This multi-tiered approach ensures that no single point of failure can compromise the facility's integrity.

## History

By the late 1990s and early 2000s, superhuman-involved crime had escalated from isolated incidents to a persistent national security concern. Conventional prisons proved unable to contain inmates with extraordinary abilities. In 1999, an individual known as "Shockwave," who possessed electromagnetic manipulation capabilities, caused a city-wide blackout while escaping from a prison in Illinois. In 2002, a telepath called "Mindscape" allegedly turned an entire prison staff into a personal army before being subdued. These high-profile failures made the case for a new approach to superhuman incarceration unavoidable.

A comprehensive federal bidding process was initiated to select a design and architectural firm for the project. The contract was awarded to Morgan, Tyler & Associates, an architectural firm with a track record in high-security infrastructure, including cutting-edge research facilities and classified government installations. Several key subcontractors joined the project: HorizonTech Innovations provided advanced surveillance systems, Lumina Industries contributed secure lighting and energy solutions, and Horvath-Small Ltd. brought expertise in disaster and weather-proofing to ensure the facility could endure extreme conditions.

An advisory board was assembled during the planning phase, drawing security veterans from domestic and international maximum-security prisons, criminal psychologists and behavior analysts, and -- controversially -- reformed supervillains who had served their sentences. These ex-superhuman consultants provided firsthand insights into potential escape methods, environmental manipulation, and the psychological stresses of incarceration, helping the design team identify and close vulnerabilities that would have been invisible to conventional planners.

Construction and planning were not without obstacles. Legal and ethical debates over whether the facility's advanced containment methods constituted cruel and unusual punishment led to court challenges that delayed construction and increased costs. Sourcing the specialized and often experimental materials required for superhuman containment demanded collaborations with research institutions and defense contractors; in some cases, entirely new materials had to be developed from scratch. Recruiting and training staff also proved difficult, as personnel required skills far beyond those of conventional corrections officers, including knowledge of diverse superhuman abilities and the facility's complex technical systems.

Daedalus became operational in 2006. In its first year of operations, three notable containment breaches occurred, and all were successfully contained. An inmate with seismic abilities attempted to cause structural damage to create an escape route, but the shock-absorbent foundations neutralized the threat. A second inmate attempted to exploit shadow manipulation, but the facility's lighting system and infrared surveillance ensured rapid re-containment. The most serious incident was a coordinated group breakout attempt in which multiple inmates combined their abilities; the rapid response protocol isolated affected sections and deployed specialized countermeasures for each ability, thwarting the escape.

Post-launch adjustments based on operational experience included upgrades to the surveillance system for better monitoring of inmates with invisibility or camouflage abilities, the establishment of a dedicated mental health wing (which reduced incidents stemming from untreated psychological issues), and improvements to internal staff communication protocols. These lessons were shared with the team constructing the Sisyphus Detention Center in Southern California, ensuring the next facility would benefit from Daedalus's pioneering experience. Location scouting and groundwork for the Tantalus Detention Center and Ixion Correctional Facility are also underway.

## In the Story

Daedalus features most prominently in Book 13: Burn After Reading, when Porcelain forces the Kingdom of Keys to execute an extraction operation targeting Daisy Zhen / Deathgirl. The operation — timed to coincide with the Harrisburg anti-vigilante legislation hearings on September 10, 2025 — results in approximately fifty prisoners escaping, including at least seven high-risk individuals. Liberty Belle had previously investigated the facility's concerning isolation features and identified the connection between its construction consultant "Espinosa" and Porcelain. Pop-pop Moe's firm Horvath-Small Ltd. designed the containment systems, and Moe's interlude (MS.1) reveals his moral reckoning with the facility's true purpose.

The prison break has cascading consequences across subsequent arcs: Shrike — one of Belle's first captures and a Daedalus escapee — launches a sustained campaign of terror against Sam in Book 13. Deathgirl's custody battle establishes legal precedent for powered youth placement at the Whitford Institute rather than maximum-security facilities. The "localized hurricane" during the break (Richardson's weather powers) contradicts her alibi of being at the Harrisburg hearings, a fact later confirmed through Mrs. Doppelganger's impersonation.

## Trivia

- The facility is named after Daedalus, the mythological Greek architect and craftsman who built the Labyrinth on Crete -- a fitting reference for a prison designed to be inescapable.
- All planned sister facilities share the Greek mythology naming convention: Sisyphus, Tantalus, and Ixion were all figures condemned to eternal punishment in the Greek underworld.
- Horvath-Small Ltd., the subcontractor responsible for disaster and weather-proofing, is Pop-pop Moe's company.
- The source article was written by Dr. Leonard R. Varnum, a Stanford-educated civil engineer, and published in Structural Security Quarterly in Fall 2008.
- Reformed supervillains served as paid consultants during the design phase, a decision that was controversial but considered invaluable by the design team.
