## Overview

Daedalus Correctional Facility is the first U.S. prison designed specifically to incarcerate superhuman individuals. It combines advanced materials science, AI-driven surveillance, behavioral psychology, and modular containment to house inmates with abilities ranging from electromagnetic manipulation to intangibility.

The design philosophy holds that containment does not necessitate cruelty. Rather than brute-force barriers alone, Daedalus employs layered human engineering, redundant security systems, and individualized protocols. Its modular architecture allows staff to tailor each cell block to specific powers, making the prison continuously adaptive.

Daedalus serves as the prototype for a planned network of superhuman facilities: Sisyphus Detention Center (under construction in Southern California), Tantalus Detention Center, and Ixion Correctional Facility (both in planning stages).

## Physical Description

Built on shock-absorbent foundations inspired by earthquake-resistant architecture, the facility withstands both natural disasters and superhuman-induced seismic events. Walls incorporate advanced composites selected to nullify specific abilities - non-conductive polymer mesh for electrical powers, treated glass for diffusing energy attacks.

The internal layout follows the Panopticon principle, with sightlines ensuring a persistent sense of observation. Color schemes are selected for calming effects, and the floor plan is deliberately disorienting to unauthorized navigation. Spaces prevent congregation and potential plotting.

The modular containment system allows individual modules to be configured, disassembled, and reassembled for bespoke containment. One module might negate electromagnetic abilities while another monitors intangibility, eliminating the need for full-facility redesigns as new inmates arrive.

Surveillance extends well beyond cameras. Distributed sensors detect unusual heat signatures, air pressure changes, and micro-vibrations as indicators of covert superhuman activity. An AI system processes data in real time, flagging anomalies immediately. Biometric authentication restricts critical-area access against shape-shifters, and a dedicated lighting system minimizes shadows, supported by infrared surveillance for shadow manipulation or invisibility. Redundancy ensures no single point of failure compromises security - if a camera fails, motion detectors and thermal sensors compensate; if a barrier is breached, automated lockdown seals affected sections.

## History

By the early 2000s, conventional prisons proved unable to contain superhuman inmates. In 1999, "Shockwave" (electromagnetic manipulation) caused a city-wide blackout escaping an Illinois prison. In 2002, telepath "Mindscape" allegedly turned an entire prison staff into a personal army before being subdued. These failures made a new approach unavoidable.

A federal bidding process awarded the design contract to Morgan, Tyler & Associates, specialists in high-security infrastructure. Key subcontractors included HorizonTech Innovations (surveillance), Lumina Industries (lighting and energy), and Horvath-Small Ltd. (disaster/weather-proofing). An advisory board included security veterans, criminal psychologists, and - controversially - reformed supervillains who provided firsthand insights into escape methods and incarceration psychology.

Construction faced obstacles: court challenges over whether containment methods constituted cruel and unusual punishment, the need to develop entirely new materials, and difficulty recruiting staff with knowledge of diverse superhuman abilities and complex technical systems.

Daedalus became operational in 2006. Three containment breaches occurred in the first year, all successfully contained: a seismic escape attempt neutralized by the shock-absorbent foundations, a shadow manipulation attempt caught by the lighting/infrared systems, and a coordinated group breakout thwarted by rapid isolation protocols. Post-launch upgrades improved invisibility monitoring, established a dedicated mental health wing (reducing psychologically driven incidents), and enhanced staff communications. These lessons informed Sisyphus's construction.

## In the Story

Daedalus features most prominently in Book 13, when Porcelain blackmails the Kingdom of Keys into extracting Daisy Zhen / Deathgirl. The operation on September 10, 2025 - timed to coincide with the Harrisburg anti-vigilante hearings - results in approximately fifty escapees, including seven high-risk individuals (the "Magnificent Seven"). Liberty Belle had previously investigated the facility and identified the connection between construction consultant "Espinosa" and Porcelain. Pop-pop Moe's firm Horvath-Small Ltd. designed the weatherproofing, and his interlude (MS.1) reveals his moral reckoning with the facility's true purpose.

Cascading consequences include Shrike's (Niles Nolan) terror campaign against Sam in Book 13, Deathgirl's custody battle establishing legal precedent for powered youth at the Whitford Institute, and the localized hurricane (Richardson's weather powers) contradicting her Harrisburg alibi via Mrs. Doppelganger's impersonation.

## Trivia

- Named after Daedalus, the mythological Greek architect who built the Labyrinth on Crete. All planned sister facilities share the Greek mythology naming convention: Sisyphus, Tantalus, and Ixion were figures condemned to eternal punishment in the underworld.
- The source article was written by Dr. Leonard R. Varnum, a Stanford-educated civil engineer, and published in Structural Security Quarterly, Fall 2008.
- Reformed supervillains served as paid consultants during design - controversial but considered invaluable by the team.
