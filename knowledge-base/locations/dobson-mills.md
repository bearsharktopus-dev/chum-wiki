## Overview

Dobson Mills is an abandoned textile factory that became one of the most significant recurring locations in Sam Small's early career. The factory was the site where Sam and Jordan first encountered the Kingdom of Keys, witnessing Mudslide murder a captive as part of a loyalty test overseen by Mr. Nothing and Mr. Polygraph. The location returned in later arcs as the site of joint operations between the Auditors and the Tacony Titans against Kingdom-connected drug distribution.

## Key Events

- **Arc 1 - Kingdom Murder and First Fight:** While scouting the Dobson Textile Factory, Sam and Jordan witnessed Mudslide kill a captive under orders from Mr. Nothing and Mr. Polygraph as a Kingdom loyalty test. Sam was discovered, and the ensuing fight left both teenagers severely injured before police sirens forced the criminals to retreat. Alex captured drone footage of the murder, which Sam later delivered to the Delaware Valley Defenders (Chapters 12-14).
- **Arc 2 - Investigation:** The Young Defenders and adult DVDs reviewed Sam's drone footage from Dobson Mills and identified the Kingdom of Keys. Lawyer Clara Parker analyzed the legal viability of the footage and noted that Dobson Mills property ownership needed checking (Chapter 15).
- **Arc 5 - Warehouse Battle:** The Auditors and Tacony Titans conducted a joint stakeout operation at the Dobson Mills warehouse, targeting Squeal and Sparkplug's drug distribution. The operation was disrupted when Miss Mayfly's team detonated stink bombs and smoke grenades, blowing their cover. The Fenrir-Sandman combo subdued Squeal while Compass and Moonshot engaged Sparkplug. Sundial was injured and required intervention from Sam and Bubble. The warehouse still contained evidence from the Arc 1 fight - bloodstains, bullet casings, and Mudslide's sealed wall gap (Chapters 80-81).
