## Overview

The Tacony Music Hall was a four-story brick building in Tacony, northeast Philadelphia, originally used as Jordan Westwood's personal hideout before becoming the shared headquarters of the Auditors. Jordan outfitted the abandoned venue with locks, dehumidifiers, furniture, and a fold-out couch, living there full-time after being effectively disowned by their mother. Sam Small took over the lease from landlord Mr. Feldman in June 2025 after Jordan departed for MIT. The building featured a Faraday cage room for secure communications, locker rooms, and a training area, serving as the team's base for mission planning, intelligence work, and recovery throughout Books 2-13.
