## Background

Angela Perez is a metahuman teenager who underwent a dramatic physical transformation resulting in an insect-like physiology. Her home life was violently abusive; her father kicked her out of the house and shot her. At some point she joined the Philly Phreaks, a gang of visually-apparent metahuman teenagers in Philadelphia led by Amira Irshad (Patches), who served as a surrogate caretaker and mother figure to the group's members.

Following Patches's arrest during the Phreaks' first confrontation with the Young Defenders on South Street, Chrysalis and the remaining Phreaks fell under the influence of Aaron McKinley, a fire-powered metahuman who attempted to assume leadership of the group. Chrysalis participated in the kidnapping and torture of Sam Small alongside Aaron, Pumice, and Deathgirl, though she expressed visible discomfort with Aaron's sadistic methods. After Sam escaped, Chrysalis led the Phreaks in severing ties with Aaron, delivering a cutting verbal assessment of his failures and abandoning him at the docks.

Chrysalis later participated in the courthouse attack during Illya Fedorov's trial, where the Phreaks distributed tainted Jump to a crowd of protesters, causing violent mutations and mass casualties. She was captured in the aftermath of the attack along with Pumice and Deathgirl, and was sent to Daedalus Correctional Facility, a metahuman prison in upstate New York. As of her PERKS assessment in August 2024, she has been placed in the general population ward and displays alternating manic rage and depression, manipulative tendencies, and an apparent lack of remorse for her involvement in the terrorist incident.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | G4/S/P/T (Insectoid Physiology), E3/S/P/B (Sensory), G2/O/P/T (Apitoxin) |
| **Category** | Gigant, Employ |
| **Power Ranking** | 4/10 |
| **Control** | 5/10 |
| **Hostility** | 7/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 1/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 4/10 |

### Abilities

- **Insectoid Physiology** — Angela has undergone a full-body transformation resulting in an insect-like anatomy. Her skin is covered in green chitin armor that provides increased durability, though it is not impenetrable. She has clawed hands and feet that offer enhanced grip and the capacity for physical damage.
- **Wings** — She possesses large insect-like wings sprouting from her back. The wings allow for controlled descent and limited hovering but are insufficient for true sustained flight.
- **Apitoxin Secretion** — Her claws secrete a venom similar to that of a common bumblebee. The toxin causes swelling and a burning sensation comparable to bee stings, posing a minor threat to most individuals but a significant danger to anyone with existing allergies to apitoxins.
- **Enhanced Sensory Capabilities** — Her antennae provide enhanced smell, hearing, and vibroreception in roughly a block-sized radius. Her modified compound eyes, which glow red, allow for control over light perception, including adjustable opacity and wavelength filtering capabilities.
- **Altered Physiology** — She weighs approximately 80 pounds, has green blood (hemolymph) of otherwise normal composition, and heals by shedding layers of chitin rather than through normal human healing processes.

### Limitations

- **Flight Limitation** — Wings are insufficient for true flight; she can only slow her descent and hover for limited periods.
- **Slow Healing** — Her healing process, which involves shedding chitin layers, is slower than normal human healing.
- **Weak Toxin** — Her apitoxin is relatively weak, comparable to a bee sting, posing minimal threat to most individuals.
- **Cognitive Limitations** — She demonstrates limited understanding of her own capabilities, particularly regarding her eye modifications and the full extent of her transformed anatomy.

### Training & Skills

- No formal combat training or professional skills on record. She relies primarily on her physical capabilities and close-quarters clawing in fights.
- Demonstrated verbal acuity and psychological insight in interpersonal confrontations, despite being described as unintelligent in some assessments.

## Personality

Angela is vain, emotionally volatile, and sharp-tongued. Her PERKS assessment describes her as alternating between manic rage and depression, with manipulative tendencies and an apparent lack of empathy. She displays unrealistic expectations about the duration and consequences of her incarceration, seemingly not fully understanding that participation in a terrorist incident may result in lifetime imprisonment. Despite being characterized as unintelligent in some accounts, she demonstrates a pointed and articulate cruelty in verbal confrontations, as seen in her dismantling of Aaron McKinley's self-image after Sam's escape.

She is not without moral limits. During Sam's torture at Aaron's hands, Chrysalis expressed visible discomfort and disdain for the brutality, particularly Deathgirl's participation, though she did not intervene to stop it. She valued Patches's leadership because Patches genuinely cared for the Phreaks as people, and she measured Aaron against that standard and found him completely lacking. Her loyalty appears rooted in personal bonds rather than ideology.

## Relationships
