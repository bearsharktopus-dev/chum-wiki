## Background

Angela Perez is a metahuman teenager who underwent a dramatic physical transformation resulting in an insect-like physiology. Her home life was violently abusive; her father kicked her out of the house and shot her. She joined the Philly Phreaks, a gang of visually-apparent metahuman teenagers in Philadelphia led by Amira Irshad (Patches), who served as a surrogate caretaker and mother figure to the group's members.

Following Patches's arrest during the South Street confrontation with the Young Defenders, Chrysalis fell under Aaron McKinley's attempted leadership, participated in the kidnapping and torture of Sam Small, and later led the Phreaks in severing ties with Aaron. She subsequently participated in the courthouse attack during Illya Fedorov's trial, where the Phreaks force-fed tainted Jump to protesters. Captured in the aftermath, she was sent to Daedalus Correctional Facility. Her PERKS assessment (August 2024) notes alternating manic rage and depression, manipulative tendencies, and an apparent lack of remorse.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | G4/S/P/T (Insectoid Physiology), E3/S/P/B (Sensory), G2/O/P/T (Apitoxin) |
| **Category** | Gigant, Employ |
| **Power Ranking** | 4/10 |
| **Control** | 5/10 |
| **Hostility** | 7/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 1/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 4/10 |

### Abilities

- **Insectoid Physiology** - Full-body transformation resulting in an insect-like anatomy. Green chitin armor provides increased durability. Clawed hands and feet offer enhanced grip and capacity for physical damage. She weighs approximately 80 pounds, has green blood (hemolymph) of otherwise normal composition, and heals by shedding chitin layers rather than through normal human healing.
- **Wings** - Elytra (beetle-like wing shields) cover larger functional wings. Allow controlled descent and limited hovering but are insufficient for sustained flight.
- **Apitoxin Secretion** - Claws secrete a venom similar to that of a common bumblebee, causing swelling and burning comparable to bee stings. Minor threat to most individuals but significant danger to anyone with apitoxin allergies.
- **Enhanced Sensory Capabilities** - Antennae provide enhanced smell, hearing, and vibroreception in roughly a block-sized radius. Modified compound eyes (glowing red) allow control over light perception, including adjustable opacity and wavelength filtering.

### Limitations

- Wings are insufficient for true flight; limited to slowed descent and brief hovering.
- Chitin-shedding healing process is slower than normal human healing.
- Apitoxin is relatively weak, comparable to a bee sting.
- Demonstrates limited understanding of her own capabilities, particularly regarding her eye modifications.

### Training & Skills

- No formal combat training; relies on physical capabilities and close-quarters clawing.
- Despite being characterized as unintelligent in some assessments, demonstrates pointed verbal acuity in interpersonal confrontations.

## Personality

Angela is vain, emotionally volatile, and sharp-tongued. She displays unrealistic expectations about the duration and consequences of her incarceration, seemingly not fully understanding that participation in a terrorist incident may result in lifetime imprisonment.

She is not without moral limits. During Sam's torture at Aaron's hands, Chrysalis expressed visible discomfort and was horrified when Aaron accidentally set Deathgirl's hair on fire, though she did not intervene. She valued Patches's leadership because Patches genuinely cared for the Phreaks as people, and she measured Aaron against that standard and found him completely lacking. Her loyalty is rooted in personal bonds rather than ideology.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Amira Irshad (Patches) | Former leader | Respected deeply for genuinely caring about the Phreaks. The standard by which she measures all other leaders. |
| Aaron McKinley | Former associate | Despised his sadistic, ego-driven leadership. Led the Phreaks in abandoning him after Sam's escape. |
| Joseph Jones (Pumice) | Teammate | Fellow Phreak. Fought alongside him in multiple engagements. |
| Daisy Zhen (Deathgirl) | Teammate | Fellow Phreak. Expressed contempt for Deathgirl's enthusiasm during Sam's torture but remained allied. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Enemy | Fought Sam on multiple occasions. Clawed her lip during South Street; envenomated and shoved her off a rooftop during the Book 4 ambush. |
