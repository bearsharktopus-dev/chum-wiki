## Background

Jasmine Perez is a metahuman from Camden, New Jersey, whose powers activated at age thirteen during an eighth-grade class trip to Camelback Mountain in the Pocono Mountains. As revealed in Interlude TJ.1, the trip was subsidized by a school grant, but her family still struggled to afford it - her mother ("Mami") picked up extra shifts at the hospital where she worked, and her father ("Papi") sold his old car instead of repairing it. Jasmine was a hyperactive child whom teachers consistently described as "bright but needs to focus," and her mother had taken her to three different doctors trying to determine why she could not sit still. Her father described her as having "his engine but somebody forgot to install the brakes."

During the class trip, Jasmine was snowboarding on an intermediate run when an avalanche struck. Ski patrol later noted the snowpack had been stable that morning, suggesting the slide was not natural in origin. Buried under heavy snow with no room to breathe, Jasmine's Activation Event triggered: her body generated extreme heat, melting the snow around her face and creating enough space to breathe and dig free. Steam poured off her body in visible waves, and the snow beneath her melted into a spreading circle of slush. Rather than seeking help for herself, she immediately searched for other buried victims. She rescued three people - a shallow-buried sixteen-year-old boy, a younger girl buried deep whom she reached by melting through the snow with her superheated hands, and an unconscious male buried so deep that her heat began to flicker during the extraction. She gave her snow clothes to the survivors before collapsing from exhaustion. Search and rescue teams credited her with enabling them to focus on the remaining four buried victims; all seven people caught in the avalanche survived with zero fatalities. Her best friend DeShawn, who had stayed inside the lodge during the run, refused to leave the hospital afterward.

Following the avalanche, Jasmine operated as a vigilante in Camden for approximately fifteen years, eventually obtaining a LUMA (License to Utilize Metahuman Abilities). She was Camden's most prominent protector, pulling people from fires, stopping muggers and carjackers, and handling metahuman threats. At age sixteen, she encountered an arsonist called Coilgun - a former shipyard worker with a multiplied-force power (described as having "extra hands" and "extra everything") who targeted corporate facilities connected to environmental pollution and predatory real estate. Their first encounter was at the Camden shipyard, where Coilgun was destroying records belonging to Delmarva Chemical, a company he accused of dumping in the river for thirty years. Coilgun challenged Jasmine's worldview, arguing that rescuing individuals did nothing to address the systems causing harm. Three weeks later, she fought him again at a real estate developer's office building, hitting Gear Four for the first time in combat. The fight was brutal - Coilgun hit her with multiplied air-compression strikes and a roundhouse kick that connected everywhere at once - but ended in a stalemate after Jasmine's tackle caused more structural damage than Coilgun had planned. She eventually captured Coilgun before her eighteenth birthday.

After fifteen years of operation, Jasmine's LUMA was revoked via letter, citing "a pattern of disproportionate collateral damage inconsistent with continued provisional licensing." Shortly afterward, she received a phone call from Maya Richardson's office. Richardson met with Jasmine in a federal building in Philadelphia, offering her a place on a government-sanctioned metahuman team (Argus Corps) as a Registered Superhuman Entity. Richardson appealed to Jasmine's desire to rebuild her reputation and framed the opportunity as "a second chance." During the meeting, Richardson showed Jasmine a news clip of herself (Maya) being interviewed years earlier about the federal ban on her own weather manipulation powers, wearing a domino mask - establishing a shared experience of institutional power being used against metahumans. This personal connection was the decisive factor in Jasmine's recruitment, though she has implied a history remarkably similar to that of Sam Small, including having been placed on an older version of the parental tracking bracelet that Sam later wore.

Argus Corps was publicly announced at a press conference following a Philadelphia City Council emergency session in late April 2025, with Jett presented as one of four operatives tasked with combating the Jump epidemic and criminal metahuman organizations. Behind the scenes, the team operated under NSRA Special Directive 14-B with detention powers, body camera mandates, and oversight nominally under Richardson. From the outset, Jett served as the team's de facto public relations figure, largely because she was attractive and personable and the team lacked any actual PR infrastructure.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Hyperthermia Immunity** - Jett's body can operate normally at any temperature below the ignition point of her tissues. This allows her to sustain the extreme heat output generated by her Gearshifting power without suffering heatstroke, burns, or thermal organ damage. At higher gears, her body radiates significant heat, enough to be felt by those nearby.
- **Passive Aerokinesis** - Jett possesses a secondary power that grants her limited control over air currents around her body. At lower gears, this manifests as enhanced movement efficiency and drag reduction. At higher gears, she can generate air shockwaves powerful enough to affect her surroundings and other combatants.
- **Gearshifting (Primary Power)** - Jett's core ability is a tiered power-amplification system she refers to as "Gearshifting," which she internally conceptualizes as a mental stickshift that she shifts up or down. At Gear Zero (her default state), she is a moderately athletic gymnast with no notable superhuman traits. Each subsequent gear doubles her energy consumption, calorie burn rate, body heat output, and physical power output in watts. Gear 1 provides 2x output, Gear 2 provides 4x, Gear 3 provides 8x, and Gear 4 provides 16x. At Gear 4, she is capable of feats such as smashing a car in half and has a lifting strength of approximately 1.6 metric tons. Higher gears dramatically increase her speed; at Gear 3, she has been observed ping-ponging off surfaces at extreme velocity during pursuit sequences. Interlude TJ.1 revealed that Gear Four first manifested during combat against Coilgun and could only be sustained for seconds at a time, with severe burnout consequences; Jasmine described it as something that "decided to hit me" rather than a deliberate activation. During her Activation Event at age thirteen, her heat generation was powerful enough to melt through packed avalanche snow on contact, creating steam clouds and bare-earth circles, but the power "guttered out" after sustained use across multiple rescue extractions.

### Limitations

- Gearshifting is directly tied to caloric consumption. Each gear doubles the rate at which Jett burns through energy reserves, meaning sustained high-gear operation rapidly depletes her stamina and requires significant food intake to recover from.
- At higher gears, Jett's body heat output becomes extreme. While she is personally immune to this heat, it can damage her surroundings and potentially injure allies or bystanders in close proximity.
- Jett has no documented enhanced durability, regeneration, or defensive capabilities beyond her heat immunity. She remains vulnerable to conventional weapons and attacks when not actively evading through speed.
- Her aerokinesis is passive and supplementary rather than a primary combat tool; she cannot direct focused wind attacks at will outside of the shockwave effects generated at higher gears.
- She is described as having no real parkour experience at Gear Zero, suggesting her impressive movement at higher gears is a product of raw power and speed rather than trained technique.
- Gear Four can only be sustained for a few seconds before risking total burnout. During the Coilgun fight in TJ.1, even brief use left her vomiting blood and unable to continue fighting at full capacity.
- Gear Five has been referenced but never fully achieved. In MR.10, Maya described Jett as approaching near Gear Five during their confrontation - Jett walked through 5-7 atmospheres of directed barokinetic force, step by step, suggesting Gear Five's output may approach or exceed 32x baseline. The full capabilities and costs of Gear Five remain unknown.

### Training & Skills

- Trained gymnast, with her costume incorporating gymnastic equipment as a reflection of this background.
- Studied karate, funded by grateful civilians she initially refused payment from but eventually accepted. Applied martial arts training during her second fight with Coilgun, using throws, clothesline attempts, and grappling in combination with her Gearshifting.
- Combat-capable in the field, though her fighting style relies more on speed, momentum, and overwhelming force than on refined martial arts technique. Fifteen years of active vigilante work in Camden provided extensive real-world combat experience.
- Competent at tactical field operations including building entry, pursuit, zip-tying suspects, and civilian extraction.
- Skilled at public relations and community interaction, particularly with children, serving as Argus Corps' primary public-facing representative.

## Personality

Interlude TJ.1 established the foundation of Jett's personality: a hyperactive, impulsive young woman whose brain was "never quiet" until she found something big enough to match what was inside her. The avalanche rescue at age thirteen was not a calculated act of heroism but an instinctive response - she heard someone screaming and went to find them. She felt the word "hero" was like "a coat that doesn't fit." Her mother's advice after the LUMA revocation captured her core: she was never going to slow down, and the question was whether she would find something worth running toward. Coilgun's philosophical challenges during their encounters - questioning whether rescuing individuals mattered if the systems causing harm remained intact - represent an unresolved tension in her worldview that she never satisfactorily answered.

Jett radiates what the narrative describes as "older sister" energy. She is warm, enthusiastic, and genuinely kind in a way that distinguishes her sharply from her more hardened or ideologically rigid teammates. She loves fighting and loves a good chase, approaching superhero work with the genre-savvy excitement of someone who grew up watching superhero procedurals rather than living through the grim political thriller that Philadelphia's metahuman landscape actually resembles. She is not unintelligent, but she is consistently unprepared for how complicated the real world is, operating under the sincere but naive belief that enough good-hearted enforcers could fundamentally restructure broken institutions from within.

Beneath the exuberance, Jett carries genuine insecurities about her tarnished reputation, which Richardson exploited during recruitment. She does not care about property damage, prioritizing people over things without hesitation, and has a documented pattern of disobeying her chain of command when she believes lives are at stake. She very rarely gets angry, and when she does, it tends to manifest as reluctant frustration rather than hostility. Her playful demeanor during the pursuit of Sam through Northeast Philadelphia, and her decision to let Sam escape after witnessing her rescue a civilian and a cat from a burning building, both speak to a moral compass that increasingly conflicts with her orders. Sam's pointed question, "Are you a superhero or not, Jett?" haunts her, and as of the beginning of Arc 16, she is actively reevaluating her life choices and investigating Maya Richardson on the down low alongside Captain Devil.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Handler / Employer / Betrayer | Richardson recruited Jett by appealing to her desire to rebuild her reputation. During their initial meeting at a federal building in Philadelphia, Richardson showed Jett a news clip of herself being interviewed about the federal ban on her own powers, wearing a domino mask - establishing a personal connection through shared experience of institutional suppression. Jett increasingly suspected Richardson and was quietly investigating her. In MR.10, Jett discovered Maya's barokinesis through an independent autopsy of Richard Duvall showing decompression injuries, and confronted Maya at her apartment - approaching near Gear Five, walking through Maya's full pressure field (5-7 atmospheres), destroying the apartment. Maya neutralized Jett's rage by revealing her daughter Roxy and framing herself as a Kingdom hostage. Jett left numb and manipulated, the anger alloyed with doubt. |
| Richard Johnson Jr. (Patriot) | Teammate / Team Leader | Fellow Argus Corps member. Patriot serves as operational leader. Jett initially dismissed Bloodhound's accusations against Richardson during a team briefing, but her views have since shifted. |
| Joshua Pleasants (Miasma) | Teammate | Fellow Argus Corps member. Unbeknownst to Jett, Miasma is a mole working against the Kingdom from within the team. |
| Andrew Mitchell (Captain Devil) | Teammate / Investigation Partner | Fellow Argus Corps member. Jett and Captain Devil are conducting a parallel, secret investigation into Maya Richardson, independent of Patriot's own covert investigation. Neither pair knows about the other's efforts. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary / Complicated Respect | Jett has pursued and confronted Sam multiple times on official orders. However, she has shown genuine interest in Sam's evidence, let Sam escape after a building rescue, and is visibly troubled by the moral implications of hunting a teenage hero. Sam's question "Are you a superhero or not?" was a turning point. Sam compares Argus Corps to fighting dogs on spiked collars and recognizes Maya as holding the leash, but cannot bring herself to hate Jett. |
| Benjamin and Rachel Small | Adversarial (by role) | Confronted the Smalls outside their home while attempting to serve Sam's arrest warrant. Rachel attempted to show tracker data proving Sam's alibi; Jett showed genuine interest in this evidence before Sam fled. |
| Mami (Mrs. Perez) | Mother | Works at a hospital. Picked up extra shifts to fund Jasmine's class trip to the Poconos. After the LUMA revocation, she told Jasmine that she had always prayed for her to find something worth running toward, and that a license could not take away what she was. |
| Papi (Mr. Perez) | Father | Former shipyard worker. Sold his old car to fund Jasmine's class trip. Described Jasmine as having "his engine but somebody forgot to install the brakes." Told Jasmine after the avalanche that she was "the hero of Camelback Mountain." |
| DeShawn | Best friend | Friends since third grade. Described as the only person who could keep up with Jasmine. Was inside the lodge during the avalanche and refused to leave the hospital afterward, sleeping on the floor of her room. |
| Coilgun | Early adversary | A former Camden shipyard worker turned arsonist who targeted corporate facilities linked to environmental pollution and predatory real estate. Possessed a multiplied-force power (extra hands/limbs, compressed-air strikes). Fought Jasmine twice during her teenage years - first at the Camden shipyard (Delmarva Chemical records), then three weeks later at a real estate developer's office. Challenged her worldview by arguing individual rescues did nothing to change systemic harm. Jasmine captured him before her eighteenth birthday. He carried a Zippo lighter and used Molotov cocktails, called himself her "Green Goblin," and told her "I'm what you need." |

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** POV (Interlude TJ.1)

    Full origin story. Jasmine's Activation Event occurred at age thirteen during an eighth-grade class trip to Camelback Mountain in the Poconos. Buried in an avalanche whose conditions suggested an unnatural origin, she generated extreme body heat that melted the surrounding snow and freed her. She then rescued three other buried victims - melting through packed snow with her superheated hands - before collapsing from exhaustion. All seven buried people survived. Three years later, as an established Camden vigilante, she encountered the arsonist Coilgun at the Camden shipyard, where he was destroying Delmarva Chemical records and lecturing her about systemic injustice. Three weeks later she fought him again at a real estate developer's office, hitting Gear Four for the first time. The fight ended in a stalemate after her tackle caused more damage than his arson plans. She captured Coilgun before turning eighteen. After fifteen years of operation, her LUMA was revoked for excessive collateral damage. Maya Richardson's office contacted her, and Richardson recruited her to Argus Corps during a meeting at a federal building in Philadelphia, sealing the pitch by showing Jasmine a news clip of her own powers being federally banned - a shared experience of institutional suppression.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude MR.10)

    Continuing to operate with Argus Corps while secretly investigating Maya Richardson alongside Captain Devil. In Interlude MR.10 (Maya's POV), Jett discovers Maya's true power (barokinesis) through an independent autopsy of Richard Duvall - the report showed decompression injuries inconsistent with natural causes. Jett confronts Maya at her apartment in a rage, approaching near "Gear Five" for the first time in the narrative, and walks through Maya's full barokinesis "hammer" (5-7 atmospheres of directed force) step by step, screaming, dragging herself against the pressure gradient. The fight destroys Maya's apartment. Maya barely outlasts her. In the aftermath, Maya manipulates Jett by revealing her daughter Roxy (Roxanne Elisabeth Hayes, age 6, fathered by Mr. Nothing) and claiming the Kingdom holds Roxy hostage to ensure her cooperation, framing herself as a captive rather than a mastermind. Jett leaves numb, the anger replaced by something more complicated. Maya's internal monologue confirms this is deliberate manipulation - "a better story than the actual one." Whether Jett fully believes it or simply cannot process the alternative remains unclear.


## Trivia

- Jett's costume consists of gymnastic equipment in blue with hot rod flames, paired with a leather jacket also decorated with hot rod flames. The aesthetic leans heavily into her speedster persona.
- She is described as "extremely attractive and knows it," which is explicitly cited as the reason she became Argus Corps' de facto PR person in the absence of an actual public relations team.
- Her implied history of wearing an older version of Sam's parental tracking bracelet suggests she may have been a monitored minor metahuman herself, creating an unspoken parallel between her past and Sam's present circumstances.
- During the chase through Northeast Philadelphia, Jett demonstrated a playful demeanor, treating the pursuit as something between a game and a job, which Sam found simultaneously infuriating and humanizing.
- Her reaction to discovering the Remora/Stingray decoy canisters were just pepper spray was described as both funny and annoyed: "They're fucking with us!"
- Sam internally compared Argus Corps to "fighting dogs on spiked collars controlled by gamblers," with Maya as the one holding the leash, but specifically noted she could not bring herself to hate Jett despite wanting to.
- The character reference guide describes her simply as "Likes Sam. Good hearted."
- Her current status as of the beginning of Arc 16 involves three simultaneous tensions: trying to keep Argus Corps ethical, being haunted by Sam's moral challenge, and secretly investigating Maya Richardson.
- Interlude TJ.1 establishes that her father's jacket (oversized, smelling of motor oil) served as her snowboarding jacket during the Camelback class trip.
- She internally conceptualizes her Gearshifting power as a mental stickshift, using car terminology ("downshift," "ka-clunk") consistent with her father's mechanical background.
- Coilgun described himself as Jasmine's "Green Goblin," casting their dynamic as an archetypal hero-nemesis relationship, and told her she needed a worthy adversary to become what the city needed. He lobbed his only Zippo lighter to her underhand during their stalemate, effectively surrendering his means of arson.
- Her LUMA revocation letter cited "disproportionate collateral damage inconsistent with continued provisional licensing." She noted that fifteen years of service ended with "a fucking letter."
- She stopped Tornado Allie in Hoboken at some point during her career, indicating her reputation extended beyond Camden.
- She funded her karate training with money from grateful civilians, which she initially refused but eventually accepted.
- The avalanche that triggered her Activation Event was described as occurring under conditions that ski patrol said were "not right for a natural slide," with the snowpack reportedly stable that morning. The cause was never officially determined.
- During the avalanche rescue, snowflakes visibly avoided her body, swirling around rather than landing on her - an early manifestation of her passive aerokinesis interacting with her heat generation.
- Maya Richardson's recruitment of Jasmine involved showing a news clip captioned with a reference to "Stormr-" (cut off), suggesting Maya operated under a hero alias beginning with "Storm" before her powers were federally banned.
- In MR.10, Jett's confrontation with Maya over the Duvall autopsy represents her most intense emotional and physical display in the narrative. She walked through Maya's full barokinetic pressure field - something that should have killed her - driven by rage at discovering her handler had murdered someone and lied about her powers for years.
- Maya's internal description of Jett during the MR.10 fight suggests Jett's near-Gear Five output was genuinely terrifying to Maya, who has neutralized multiple opponents with her pressure powers. This is the closest Maya has come to losing a direct physical confrontation.
- After the MR.10 confrontation, Jett's knowledge of Maya's barokinesis and the Duvall murder makes her the most dangerous person to Maya's cover - whether she believes the "hostage mother" narrative or not, she now holds information that could unravel everything.
