## Background

Jasmine Perez is a metahuman from Camden, New Jersey, whose powers activated at age thirteen when an avalanche struck during an eighth-grade class trip to Camelback Mountain. Buried under heavy snow, her body generated extreme heat - melting the snow around her and producing visible steam. She rescued three other buried victims before collapsing from exhaustion; all seven people caught in the avalanche survived. Her hyperactive childhood - teachers described her as "bright but needs to focus," and her mother took her to three different doctors - found its outlet in heroism. Her father described her as having "his engine but somebody forgot to install the brakes."

She operated as Camden's most prominent protector for approximately fifteen years, eventually obtaining a LUMA. At sixteen she fought the arsonist Coilgun twice - first at the Camden shipyard, where he challenged her worldview about systemic harm versus individual rescues; then at a real estate developer's office, where she hit Gear Four for the first time. She captured him before her eighteenth birthday. Her reputation extended beyond Camden, notably stopping Tornado Allie in Hoboken.

After fifteen years, her LUMA was revoked for "disproportionate collateral damage." Maya Richardson then recruited her to Argus Corps at a federal building in Philadelphia, sealing the pitch by revealing her own history of institutional suppression - showing a news clip of herself in a domino mask, captioned with "Stormr-" (cut off), referencing a federal ban on her weather manipulation powers. The team was publicly announced following a City Council emergency session in late April 2025, with Jett presented as one of four operatives. She became the team's de facto PR figure, largely because she was attractive and personable and the team lacked actual PR infrastructure.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Hyperthermia Immunity** - Jett's body operates normally at any temperature below the ignition point of her tissues, allowing her to sustain extreme heat output without heatstroke or burns.
- **Passive Aerokinesis** - Limited control over air currents around her body. At lower gears this manifests as drag reduction; at higher gears she generates air shockwaves powerful enough to affect combatants. During her Activation Event, snowflakes visibly avoided her body, swirling around rather than landing on her.
- **Gearshifting (Primary Power)** - A tiered power-amplification system she internally conceptualizes as a mental stickshift. At **Gear Zero** (default), she is a moderately athletic gymnast with no superhuman traits. **Gear 1**: mild superhuman speed and warmth. **Gear 2**: skin flushes red with visible heat shimmer; approximately twice normal sprint speed, sustained indefinitely. **Gear 3**: skin bright red with steam rising off her shoulders; dramatically faster, capable of ping-ponging off surfaces at extreme velocity. **Gear 4**: air visibly warps from heat; cannonball speed, capable of smashing a car in half or tackling through multiple walls. **Gear 5**: referenced but never fully achieved (see Limitations). Jett needs to cool down between gear activations.

### Limitations

- Gearshifting is directly tied to caloric consumption; each gear roughly doubles her burn rate, requiring significant food intake to recover from sustained high-gear use.
- Body heat at higher gears can damage surroundings and injure allies or bystanders in close proximity.
- No documented enhanced durability or regeneration. Vulnerable to conventional weapons when not evading through speed.
- Aerokinesis is passive and supplementary; she cannot direct focused wind attacks outside of higher-gear shockwaves.
- No real parkour experience at Gear Zero; impressive movement at higher gears comes from raw power rather than technique.
- Gear Four can only be sustained for seconds before risking total burnout; during the Coilgun fight (TJ.1), brief use left her vomiting blood.
- Gear Five was partially attempted in MR.10: eyes went bloodshot, nose bled immediately. She walked through Maya's full 6-7 atmosphere barokinetic field step by step - something Maya's internal monologue noted Patriot could not have done, and Mr. Tyrannosaur probably could not have either. The effort burned approximately 8,000 calories in roughly 10 seconds, causing a severe caloric crash. Full capabilities remain unknown.

### Training & Skills

- Trained gymnast; costume incorporates gymnastic equipment reflecting this background.
- Studied karate, funded by grateful civilians she initially refused payment from but eventually accepted. Applied martial arts during the second Coilgun fight using throws and grappling in combination with Gearshifting.
- Fifteen years of active vigilante work in Camden provided extensive real-world combat experience. Fighting style relies on speed, momentum, and overwhelming force rather than refined technique. Not military-trained; approach is instinctive rather than strategic.
- Skilled at public relations and community interaction, particularly with children.

## Personality

Jett is a hyperactive, impulsive woman whose brain was "never quiet" until she found something big enough to match what was inside her. The avalanche rescue was instinctive, not calculated - she felt the word "hero" was like "a coat that doesn't fit." Coilgun's philosophical challenges about systemic harm remain an unresolved tension in her worldview.

She radiates "older sister" energy - warm, enthusiastic, and genuinely kind in a way that distinguishes her from her more hardened teammates. She approaches superhero work with genre-savvy excitement, having grown up on superhero procedurals rather than living through the grim political thriller that Philadelphia actually resembles. She is not unintelligent, but consistently unprepared for how complicated the real world is, operating under the sincere but naive belief that enough good-hearted enforcers could restructure broken institutions from within.

Beneath the exuberance, Jett carries insecurities about her tarnished reputation. She prioritizes people over property without hesitation and has a documented pattern of disobeying her chain of command when she believes lives are at stake. She very rarely gets angry, and when she does it manifests as reluctant frustration rather than hostility. Sam's question - "Are you a superhero or not, Jett?" - haunts her, and as of Arc 16 she is actively investigating Maya Richardson alongside Captain Devil.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Handler / Betrayer | Recruited Jett by using her real name "Jasmine" and exploiting her desire to rebuild her reputation. In MR.10, Jett confronted Maya with an independent autopsy proving she killed Duvall via barokinesis - approached near Gear Five, walked through Maya's full pressure field, leaving a Jett-shaped imprint in cracked tile. Maya manipulated her in the aftermath with selective truth about her daughter Roxy, reframing herself as a Kingdom hostage. Jett left numb, the anger alloyed with doubt. |
| Richard Johnson Jr. (Patriot) | Teammate / Team Leader | Fellow Argus Corps member. Jett initially dismissed Bloodhound's accusations against Richardson but has since shifted. Called him "Richard" and argued for Sam's rights during the Arc 15 pursuit. |
| Joshua Pleasants (Miasma) | Teammate | Fellow Argus Corps member. Unbeknownst to Jett, Miasma is a mole working against the Kingdom from within the team. |
| Andrew Mitchell (Captain Devil) | Teammate / Investigation Partner | Conducting a secret parallel investigation into Richardson - walking corridors without working cameras, leveraging Jett's FBI contacts. Jett stole Patriot's phone and discovered he was running his own investigation (barokinesis articles, Duvall research, weather reports, Silverstein). Neither investigating pair knows about the other's work. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary / Complicated Respect | Pursued Sam multiple times on orders. During the Tacony chase, displayed warmth even mid-pursuit and offered to investigate Sam's claims. In Ch. 225, let Sam go after witnessing her rescue a civilian - a pivotal moral turning point. Sam compares Argus Corps to fighting dogs on spiked collars but cannot bring herself to hate Jett. |
| Benjamin and Rachel Small | Adversarial (by role) | Confronted the Smalls outside their home while serving Sam's arrest warrant. Showed genuine interest in Rachel's tracker data before Patriot overrode her. |
| Mami (Mrs. Perez) | Mother | Hospital worker. Picked up extra shifts to fund the Poconos class trip. After the LUMA revocation, told Jasmine a license could not take away what she was. |
| Papi (Mr. Perez) | Father | Construction/mechanic background. Sold his old car to fund the class trip. His oversized jacket, smelling of motor oil, served as Jasmine's snowboarding jacket during the Camelback trip. |
| DeShawn | Best friend | Friends since third grade; the only person who could keep up with Jasmine. Was inside the lodge during the avalanche and refused to leave the hospital afterward. |
| Coilgun | Early adversary | Former Camden shipyard worker turned arsonist targeting corporate facilities linked to pollution. Possessed a multiplied-force power ("extra hands") capable of throwing walls of compressed air. Challenged her worldview about systemic harm. Called himself her "Green Goblin" and told her she needed a worthy adversary. Surrendered his Zippo lighter to her during their stalemate. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Recruited by Maya Richardson alongside Patriot, Miasma, and Captain Devil during Interlude MR.4, arriving at the sterile coworking space with wild neon-streaked hair, a leather jacket, and a blue bodysuit. Immediately snarky, she opened with "Which one of you is the narc?" and referred to Patriot as "Captain America's racist cousin." Richardson used her real name - "Jasmine" - to get her attention, then appealed to her desire to rebuild her tarnished reputation. Publicly introduced at the Argus Corps press conference as a founding member (Ch. 160). Named in the confidential internal proposal document (Interlude MR.5) as one of four operatives under NSRA Special Directive 14-B. Present at the Pennsport marina during Sam's undercover infiltration of Rogue Wave's Jump distribution event (Ch. 157): entered as a tan brunette in a leotard with flames and a red jacket, using super-speed to zip-tie fleeing dealers while laughing manically. Interfered with Sam's fight against Soot, activated Gear Three burning with heat and slamming through dealers. Zip-tied Sam, though Sam broke free once Jett stopped paying attention. Participated in the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse raid (Ch. 163-164): forced open the warehouse shutter, attacked Kingdom enforcer Bash with super-speed and heat generation, and operated as part of the full team during the chaotic three-way battle. Discussed by the Auditors as they investigate connections between Argus Corps, Tremont & Fairfax, and the Kingdom.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as part of Argus Corps' expanding anti-vigilante enforcement and drug-distribution raids across Philadelphia following the Stheno warehouse destruction.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present during Patriot's team briefing where Bloodhound's accusations against Richardson were shared; dismissed the claims entirely. Part of the "Safer Streets Initiative" offering $500 bounties for reporting powered youth. Tasked with running a background check on Tremont & Fairfax after Bulldozer presented evidence connecting the firm to Argus Corps and McKinley's pro bono defense; her research initially turned up nothing concrete. Has FBI connections that she would later leverage during her Richardson investigation.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Argus Corps committed full resources to hunting Shrike, establishing checkpoints throughout Northeast Philadelphia.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as part of continued Argus Corps operations during the Shrike crisis and its aftermath.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Confronted Sam alongside Patriot on January 3rd with an arrest warrant for unlicensed vigilantism, citing twelve incidents over six weeks with eyewitness reports and security footage - evidence Sam recognized as belonging to an impersonator. Pursued Sam through Tacony and Northeast Philadelphia (Ch. 222-223), wearing her racing-suit costume with friendship bracelets, dark hair in a practical ponytail. Displayed manic energy throughout - shouting "We ARE 911!" at a bystander and quoting "The arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards justice." Escalated through Gear 2 and Gear 3 during the chase, needing to cool down between activations. Offered to investigate Sam's claims about the Kingdom frame-up and Maya's Harrisburg impersonation. Caught Sam arm's length from her front door; showed genuine interest in Rachel Small's tracker data as "procedure" before Patriot overrode her. Called Patriot "Richard" and argued Sam had rights, but Sam kicked Jett's toes and escaped.

    Later encountered Sam at a burning Kingdom front in Rittenhouse Square (Ch. 225), arriving at Gear 1. After Sam rescued a trapped civilian and an orange tabby cat, Sam handed Jett the cat and asked "Are you a superhero or not, Jett?" Jett told Sam to go and reported: "Lost visual. Securing civilian. Requesting EMS."

    During the Remora/Stingray operation (Ch. 232), insisted "We need to get the councilwoman out first. Then the civilians. That's what a hero does." Called "Gear Three!" and flew at Sam (disguised as Remora) at cannonball speed but disengaged when Sam aimed the prop weapon at her. Made a perfect soccer-goalie dive to catch a pepper spray canister Sam fired at the storefront, bear-paw swatting it into Captain Devil's snow wall. When Sam fired a second canister downwind, bluffing it was a prion bioweapon, Jett called "Gear Four!" and chased it at cannonball speed, giving Sam fifteen seconds to operate. Upon realizing the canisters were pepper spray: "It's just fucking pepper spray! They're fucking with us!"

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** POV (Interlude TJ.1); Supporting (Interlude AM.1)

    Full origin story in Interlude TJ.1. Jasmine's Activation Event at age thirteen during the Camelback class trip - the family struggled to afford it (Mami's extra shifts, Papi selling his car). Buried in an avalanche whose conditions suggested unnatural origin, she generated extreme body heat, rescued three victims, and collapsed. She became Camden's most prominent protector, operating initially with no license in a domino mask. Fought Coilgun twice as a teenager - the first at the shipyard where he lectured her on systemic injustice and escaped behind a wall of fire; the second at a real estate developer's office where she hit Gear Four for the first time, tackling him through five walls. She captured him before age eighteen. After fifteen years, her LUMA was revoked. Richardson recruited her via a phone call from Sarah in Councilwoman Richardson's office, sealing the pitch with the shared-suppression news clip (captioned "Stormr-", suggesting the alias Stormrise).

    In Interlude AM.1 (Captain Devil's POV), Jett is sent to a ribbon-cutting in Gray's Ferry for PR duties. Afterward, she and Captain Devil discuss their covert Richardson investigation in corridors without cameras. Her FBI contact pulled clean files on Tremont & Fairfax - the only notable detail being that Katherine Huang handled both McKinley's pro bono case and Argus Corps paperwork. She stole Patriot's phone and discovered his browser tabs revealed a parallel investigation: an article on barokinesis, Duvall research, weather reports from two years ago, and Silverstein information. Jett and Devil also noted Miasma had become "different lately. More distant."

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude MR.10)

    Present at the Argus Corps Oversight Transition meeting at City Hall, where Davis's coalition voted to distribute oversight away from Richardson (effective April 1st). Maya noted Jett had been watching her differently for two weeks. Referenced as backup during Mr. Nothing's subway intercept of Sam (Ch. 246), though Patriot saved Sam before Jett arrived.

    In Interlude MR.10 (Maya's first-person POV), Jett arrives at Maya's apartment in civilian clothes, already running Gear One or Two, furious. She had obtained an independent autopsy of Richard Duvall showing decompression injuries - lungs exploded, petechiae, no neck bruises - consistent with hard vacuum exposure, not natural causes. Maya's reaction: "Fuck. I forgot that thread." The confrontation is framed with chess metaphors throughout. Jett screamed "STOP LYING TO ME!" and cracked Maya's tile floor with a heat burst, then began to call "GEAR FI-" - eyes going bloodshot, nose bleeding.

    Maya clamped a column of air around Jett at 6-7 atmospheres of directed barokinetic force - breaking all her lamps, producing a sound like a sonic boom. Jett was driven to her knees, leaving a Jett-shaped imprint in the cracked tile. Then she walked through it, dragging herself step by step against the pressure gradient while screaming. Both collapsed exhausted and bleeding afterward. Maya fed Jett orange juice and peanut butter for the caloric crash, then executed "Option Three" - the truth, selectively arranged. She admitted killing Duvall (framing it as self-defense against blackmail), revealed her daughter Roxy (Roxanne Elisabeth Hayes, age 6, fathered by Mr. Nothing, living with his relatives in the Bronx), showed her c-section scar, and claimed the Kingdom held Roxy hostage. Jett's mental model shifted from "criminal boss" to "hostage mother." Maya's internal monologue: "Neither model is accurate. But one of them lets her sleep tonight, and that's the one she's choosing."


## Trivia

- Jett's costume is a red jacket with blue and yellow trim resembling a racing suit.
- She implied a history remarkably similar to Sam Small's, including having worn an older version of the parental tracking bracelet Sam later wore.
- She is simply characterized as someone who "likes Sam" and is "good hearted."
- Her current status involves three simultaneous tensions: keeping Argus Corps ethical, being haunted by Sam's moral challenge, and secretly investigating Richardson.
- She internally uses car terminology for Gearshifting ("downshift," "ka-clunk"), consistent with her father's mechanical background.
- Her LUMA revocation ended fifteen years of service with "a fucking letter."
- During the Ch. 232 operation, Sam (disguised as Remora) and Jett traded quips: Jett called Sam "Shark boy. Or whatever the fuck," and Sam replied "Remora. Don't forget it."
- Maya's apartment has reinforced walls and windows rated for her full operational output - yet the MR.10 confrontation still destroyed it.
- Jett's near-Gear Five output in MR.10 was genuinely terrifying to Maya, who has neutralized multiple opponents with pressure powers - the closest Maya has come to losing a direct physical confrontation.
- Jett now holds information that could unravel Maya's entire cover, regardless of whether she believes the "hostage mother" narrative.
- Maya's internal monologue during the Arc 16 oversight meeting revealed she deliberately built Argus Corps with incompatible personalities, knowing the team would eventually "rattle apart."
- Jett and Devil's Tremont & Fairfax investigation found Trent Fairfax "Clean. Boringly, aggressively clean." The central unanswered question: why a NYC megafirm would take pro bono work for "a two-bit Philly arsonist who went after a teenage girl."
