??? warning "Background"

    Andrew Mitchell is a metahuman from Trenton, New Jersey, who gained his powers approximately ten years before the events of the main story during a solo camping trip in the Pine Barrens. Mitchell had been visiting the Pine Barrens since he was nineteen -- first with friends, then alone, then with his partner Diana when they began dating. He treated these solo trips as a periodic reset, something Diana understood he needed every few months the way she needed her sister weekends. On the night of his activation event, he detected a distant wildfire approximately two miles west and began breaking down camp. Before he could evacuate, the forest emptied around him: a deer crashed through his campsite clipping his cooler, followed by a fox, rabbits, squirrels, and a nocturnal raccoon waddling at maximum speed. Distant sounds resembling gunshots accompanied the exodus. A black bear, approximately three hundred pounds, charged through at a full sprint -- not hunting but fleeing in pure animal panic, trailing a cub behind it. Mitchell was directly in its path with no time to climb or run. He attempted to calculate which limbs he could sacrifice, thinking "Please. I have a fiance. Probably kids." The bear mauled him, leaving a significant scar on his chest that still itches when he thinks about the Barrens. The traumatic encounter served as his activation event, granting him a suite of powers loosely themed around the Jersey Devil of regional folklore: invisible telekinetic claws, echolocation, a fear-inducing aura, and toxic blood.

    Following his activation, Mitchell spent a period learning to control his abilities, during which he accidentally killed a civilian. This incident left a lasting psychological mark and became a core motivator in his superhero career, driving him to seek redemption and reclaim his name through legitimate heroism. He adopted the identity of Captain Devil (sometimes Captain Jersey Devil), deliberately styling himself after tokusatsu heroes and dark justice archetypes from the anime and sentai media he loves. His signature look -- a domino mask, large red scarf inspired by Kamen Rider, and red beret -- reflects this aesthetic sensibility.

    Mitchell was recruited to Argus Corps by Councilwoman Maya Richardson during a private meeting at a rented coworking space, where Richardson appealed specifically to his desire for redemption and the chance to rebuild his legacy. He was the last of the four founding members to arrive at the recruitment meeting and remained the most reserved and detached of the group. When Argus Corps was publicly unveiled at a press conference in late April 2025, Mitchell made a dramatic entrance as the team's newest member. He subsequently relocated to the Philadelphia area to serve on the team, commuting via SEPTA and maintaining a family home in a residential neighborhood.

??? note "Powers & Abilities"

    **PERKS Assessment**

    No official PERKS assessment on file.

    **Abilities**

    - **Invisible Telekinetic Claws** - Mitchell's primary power consists of two invisible telekinetic appendages positioned above his left and right shoulders. Each appendage has two talons approximately the size of a human arm. The claws lack fine gripping dexterity and are not sharp enough to pierce skin, but they are highly effective at destroying property, capturing and restraining people, and intimidating animals. Mitchell can only control them in broad sweeping gestures rather than precise movements. He has described them as sitting on his shoulders "like two invisible albatrosses." The claws are capable of damaging marble flooring and can clear smoke from his immediate path.
    - **Echolocation** - A secondary sensory ability that allows Mitchell to navigate and track targets in low-visibility conditions. During the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse confrontation, he demonstrated the ability to track Soot through dense smoke where visual tracking was impossible.
    - **Fear Aura** - Mitchell passively emanates a supernatural sense of dread that affects those in his proximity. The aura is most effective against animals but also produces an instinctual fear response in humans. Sam Small experienced this effect firsthand during their encounters, describing it as an involuntary, gut-level terror distinct from ordinary intimidation.
    - **Poisonous, Acidic Blood** - Mitchell's blood is both toxic and corrosive, rendering him extremely dangerous to bite-based or blood-contact attackers. Sam discovered this limitation during their confrontation at Richardson's town hall event, realizing she could not safely use her tooth-based attacks against him.

    **Limitations**

    - The telekinetic claws lack fine motor control and can only be directed in sweeping gestures, limiting their utility in precision tasks or situations requiring delicate handling.
    - The claws cannot pierce human skin, making them ineffective as cutting or stabbing weapons; their utility is primarily in blunt force, restraint, and property destruction.
    - Mitchell's fear aura appears to function passively rather than as a directed ability, and its effectiveness varies significantly depending on the target (strongest against animals, weaker and more variable against humans).
    - The acidic blood is a defensive trait rather than one Mitchell can weaponize offensively; it protects him from certain attackers but does not grant him ranged capability.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Experienced outdoorsman and hiker who has been visiting the Pine Barrens since age nineteen, with years of wilderness survival knowledge including campsite management, fire safety, weather assessment, wind direction analysis, and wildlife behavior interpretation. During the Pine Barrens incident, he correctly assessed the wildfire's distance (~2 miles), direction (east-southeast), and timeline (hours before reaching his position) and began orderly evacuation before the animal exodus changed the situation.
    - Competent hand-to-hand combatant, utilizing the heavy bag and training facilities at Argus Corps headquarters regularly.
    - Skilled investigator who pieces together intelligence from overheard conversations, meeting notes, and behavioral patterns to form conclusions about colleagues and targets.
    - Demonstrates strong interpersonal skills and institutional knowledge, maintaining relationships with support staff and civilians at Argus Corps headquarters.

??? warning "Personality"

    Andrew Mitchell presents a striking contrast between his intimidating exterior and his genuine warmth. Tall and physically imposing, he cuts an intentionally fearsome figure as Captain Devil, but beneath the domino mask and flowing red scarf is a devoted father, an avid comic book nerd, and a man who makes a point of learning the names of support staff and asking about their families. He is an enthusiast of anime, tokusatsu, and Kamen Rider -- interests that remain relatively obscure in his world's timeline -- and his entire superhero aesthetic is built around the "dark hero of justice" archetype he admires from those media. He follows tokusatsu release forums in his downtime and debates whether he can justify the price of a new Kuuga figure.

    Mitchell's approach to the dual-identity problem is deliberate and ritualistic: the scarf and beret go on in the elevator down to the hero level, and they come off and go into his bag when he leaves. Captain Devil stays in the car; Andrew Mitchell walks through the front door. He frames this separation as essential to protecting both the people he works with and the people he comes home to.

    Mitchell operates under a persistent "just doing my job" mentality that functions as cognitive dissonance for the morally uncomfortable work Argus Corps requires. He would prefer saving lives defensively to fighting criminals proactively, and he struggles openly with assignments that pit him against people he believes are doing more good than harm -- such as the Kensington phase-walker who destroys pharmacy fentanyl supplies. The accidental killing of a civilian during his early career weighs on him heavily and informs his cautious, measured approach to confrontations. He gave Sam Small an opportunity to surrender peacefully before using force at the town hall, and he chose not to pursue Sam and Maggie once they escaped into a public area with civilians. He has been described as "really too nice for this team," and the growing contradictions between his moral compass and Argus Corps' direction are building toward a likely defection or resignation.

??? warning "Relationships"

    | Character | Relationship | Notes |
    |-----------|-------------|-------|
    | Jasmine Perez (Turbo Jett) | Teammate / Investigative partner | The two conduct a secret parallel investigation into Maya Richardson's potential Kingdom ties, sharing intelligence in corridors without working cameras (exploiting Jenkins's maintenance backlog). Jett is more impulsive -- she stole Patriot's unlocked phone during a bathroom break to read his browser tabs, prompting Mitchell to hiss her first name in exasperation. She returned it to Patriot's table within minutes. Her FBI contact revealed that Tremont & Fairfax's lawyer Huang handled both the firm's incorporation paperwork and Aaron McKinley's pro bono case, raising the question of why a New York megafirm would take pro bono defense of a minor Philly arsonist. They address each other by first name (Jasmine and Andrew) when off the record. Jett's parting advice about the Kensington phase-walker ("He's not wrong about the drugs") stayed with Mitchell all afternoon. |
    | Richard Johnson (Patriot) | Teammate / Team leader | Mitchell serves under Patriot's command and follows his operational assignments. He pieced together from overheard conversations and meeting notes that Patriot walked into Maya Richardson's office months ago and told her directly that a teenage vigilante (Bulldozer/McNulty) thinks she is Kingdom -- a disclosure Mitchell considers either incredibly stupid or "something else." Jett's theft of Patriot's phone revealed he was independently researching barokinesis, Richard Duvall, Councilman Silverstein, and two-year-old weather reports, suggesting his own parallel investigation that neither Mitchell nor Jett fully understand. |
    | Joshua Pleasants (Miasma) | Teammate | Mitchell finds Miasma cryptic and difficult to read, noting he has grown even more distant and impossible to interpret. Suspects Miasma knows more than he shares but cannot determine his true allegiance. |
    | Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Ostensible superior / Investigation target | Richardson recruited Mitchell to Argus Corps by appealing to his desire for redemption. Mitchell now suspects she may be Mrs. Zenith of the Kingdom of Keys, placing a fifty-fifty probability on the assessment. He is investigating her quietly alongside Jett. |
    | Sean McNulty (Bulldozer) | Indirect contact | Mitchell believes Bulldozer's claim that Richardson is Kingdom, which was relayed through Patriot's team briefing. This intelligence forms the foundation of his secret investigation. |
    | Diana Mitchell | Fiancee/Wife | A pediatric clinic worker who wears light blue scrubs (pediatric ward) and tolerates Andrew's camping trips and nerd hobbies, sometimes buying him tokusatsu figures for Christmas despite rolling her eyes at the hobby. She reads his moods perceptively ("You're thinking too loud") and teases him as "Mr. Dark Hero of Justice." She leaves the front door unlocked despite Mitchell asking approximately eight hundred times, insisting "the neighbors watch out for each other." She accompanied him on Pine Barrens trips when they were dating and understands his need for periodic solo resets. She smells like hand sanitizer and floral lotion from the constant washing her clinic work requires. They have a warm, stable partnership built on mutual understanding of each other's separate lives. |
    | Malik Mitchell | Son | Ten years old, perfecting the dismissive older sibling routine. Sleeps with a tablet under his pillow. Resembles Diana when sleeping. |
    | Destiny Mitchell | Daughter | Seven years old, convinced that running is superior to walking. Takes after Andrew's side of the family. Firmly believes cartwheels should be a superpower. |
    | Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary (professional) | Mitchell has pursued and fought Sam on multiple occasions as part of his Argus Corps duties, but conducts these confrontations with restraint and professionalism. He offered Sam a chance to surrender at the town hall and chose not to pursue her into a civilian area. |
    | Marcus (Security Guard) | Colleague (support staff) | Front desk security guard at Argus Corps headquarters. Mitchell makes a point of asking about Marcus's family; Marcus's daughter Tamika made the Dean's List at Temple University. Their brief daily exchanges reflect Mitchell's deliberate effort to maintain relationships with non-powered staff. |
    | Rosario (Dispatch) | Colleague (support staff) | Dispatch operator at Argus Corps headquarters. Reported a quiet overnight shift to Mitchell, including a kid practicing pyrokinesis in a Fishtown garage. Mitchell makes a point of learning support staff names and engaging with them personally. |
    | Jenkins (Tech Support) | Colleague (support staff) | Argus Corps tech support, often seen working on Jett's backup suit. Mentioned a maintenance backlog that left some corridor cameras non-functional -- a fact Mitchell and Jett exploit for their private conversations about the Richardson investigation. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Recruited by Maya Richardson during a private meeting (Interlude MR.4), where Richardson appealed to his desire for redemption. Arrived last and remained the most reserved of the four recruits. Publicly introduced as a founding member of Argus Corps at Richardson's press conference (Ch. 160), making a dramatic debut. Named in the confidential Argus Corps formation proposal as Andrew "Captain Devil" Mitchell (Interlude MR.5). Participates in the Argus Corps raid on the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse (Ch. 163-164): his fear aura creates an instinctual terror response in Sam upon arrival, demonstrates the ability to clear smoke and track targets through obscured conditions using echolocation. Patriot orders the team to detain all capes present. The warehouse is ultimately destroyed by Soot's chemical chain reaction, and the Auditors escape. Discussed by the Auditors as they investigate the legal connections behind Argus Corps.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as part of Argus Corps' expanding operations during the post-Stheno period. The team's public prominence increases under Richardson's direction as they conduct anti-vigilante enforcement and drug-distribution raids across Philadelphia. Captain Devil is noted in the heavily redacted Argus Corps after-action report from the warehouse incident.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present during the Argus Corps team briefing where Patriot reveals Bulldozer's accusations against Richardson (Chapter 182). Expresses "quiet concern" about the allegations while Jett dismisses them. Assigned to follow up on the Kensington phase-walker situation. Confronts Sam at Richardson's town hall event (Chapters 191-192), giving her an opportunity to surrender before engaging. Reveals his powers include invisible extendable talons and acidic blood during the fight. Pursues Sam through City Hall corridors, damaging marble floors with his claws. Knocked off balance by Maggie's force fields, allowing Sam to escape through a window. Chooses not to pursue once Sam and Maggie reach a public area with civilians. His near-capture of Sam marks the climax of the arc.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Participates in Argus Corps operations during the escalating conflict between vigilantes, the Kingdom, and Rogue Wave. Maggie reports his rooftop position during the Richardson town hall event. Part of the team responding to the broader crisis in Philadelphia. Referenced in discussions about Argus Corps' growing public prominence and operational reach.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Argus Corps commits full resources to hunting the serial killer Shrike. Lily reports Argus Corps checkpoints throughout Northeast Philadelphia. The team is referenced operating at capacity during the crisis.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Argus Corps confronts Sam with an arrest warrant (Chapter 222), though Patriot and Turbo Jett handle the direct confrontation. During the operation to capture Alice (the Kingdom shapeshifter), Captain Devil and Miasma evacuate the person they believe to be Maya Richardson to an unmarked car (Chapter 232/Interlude MaM.1), unknowingly delivering Alice directly into Miasma's custody. Participates in crowd control during the Remora and Stingray operation. Referenced as part of Argus Corps being "played" by Sam's strategic misdirection. Maxwell Martinez notes Argus Corps hitting three Rogue Wave distribution points in one week, identifying this as Maya's PR strategy to keep the team "visible."

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up (AM.1)"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude)

    The focus character of Interlude AM.1, which provides the only extended first-person perspective of Mitchell's life. The interlude opens with a detailed flashback to his activation event in the Pine Barrens, depicting the wildfire, the mass animal exodus, and the bear mauling with its cub. Transitions to a full day in his current life: his SEPTA commute (checking tokusatsu forums, saving Diana's breakfast photo of the kids), the morning briefing at Argus Corps headquarters where Patriot assigns Jett to a Gray's Ferry ribbon-cutting, Mitchell to the Kensington phase-walker follow-up, and Miasma to narcotics coordination. The briefing also covers the Turnout armored car robbery pattern on I-95 (third robbery that month, same two exits, suggesting inside information) and a new drug called "Love Potion Number Ten" -- small glass corked phials of bubbling pink liquid producing heart-shaped smoke, allegedly inducing love for a day or two. Mitchell and Jett conduct their secret investigation in corridors without working cameras: Jett's FBI contact found Tremont & Fairfax to be aggressively cooperative but the Fairfax connection "boringly, aggressively clean," with the central question being why a New York megafirm took pro bono defense of Aaron McKinley, a two-bit Philly arsonist. Jett stole Patriot's unlocked phone during his bathroom break, revealing his research tabs: an American Institute of Dynology article on barokinesis, encyclopedia articles on Tyrannosaurus Rex and Richard Duvall, Duvall's high school yearbook, stock reports, two-year-old weather reports, and an article on Councilman Silverstein. Mitchell revealed he had deduced that Patriot told Maya Richardson about Bulldozer's accusations months earlier, right after McNulty brought them to him. The failed Kensington search (the phase-walker had varied his pattern, not hitting the same area twice) and the evening at home with Diana, Malik, and Destiny follow, ending with Mitchell's resolve to find the truth about Maya -- "non-violently, of course."

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Continues operating with Argus Corps. Investigating Maya Richardson alongside Turbo Jett, keeping their inquiry secret because he does not know who to trust. Believes Bulldozer's intelligence about Maya being Kingdom. The contradictions between his moral convictions and Argus Corps' direction continue to heighten. At the Argus Corps oversight transition meeting (MR.10), visibly checked out and on his phone -- a detail Maya notes, suggesting his disengagement from the team's official mission is becoming outwardly apparent.


??? warning "Trivia"

    - The interlude AM.1 opens with lyrics from the original Kamen Rider theme song and closes with lyrics from Foo Fighters' "My Hero," both reflecting Mitchell's character arc as an ordinary person trying to be heroic.
    - Mitchell follows a tokusatsu release forum and was debating the purchase of a new Kuuga figure during his Pine Barrens camping trip, placing his fandom squarely in the Heisei era of Kamen Rider.
    - His Cape name "Captain Devil" and alternate name "Captain Jersey Devil" are references to the Jersey Devil of Pine Barrens folklore, connecting his identity to the location of his activation event.
    - Diana's refusal to lock the front door is a running domestic friction point that Mitchell has raised "approximately eight hundred times."
    - Mitchell explicitly notes that he leaves the Captain Devil persona in his bag or his car and enters his home as Andrew Mitchell, maintaining a deliberate psychological separation between his two identities.
    - The character reference guide describes him as "really too nice for this team," a sentiment borne out by his consistent restraint in confrontations and his empathy for targets like the Kensington phase-walker.
    - He is one of at least three Argus Corps members independently investigating Maya Richardson as of Arc 16: Mitchell and Jett work together, Patriot investigates alone, and Miasma operates as a full mole. None of them are aware of the full scope of the others' inquiries.
    - Mitchell's children are named Malik (age 10) and Destiny (age 7). Diana works at a pediatric clinic.
    - His fear aura's effectiveness on animals is consistent with the Jersey Devil folklore, which traditionally describes a creature that terrorizes livestock and wildlife.
    - During the Pine Barrens flashback, Mitchell recognized the bear's intent was not predatory -- it was a mother fleeing with its cub -- and noted they were thinking the same thing in that moment: protecting their families. He was "just in the way."
    - The scar on his chest from the bear mauling itches when he thinks about the Pine Barrens, described as feeling like it "happened to someone else entirely" while also feeling like yesterday.
    - His neighborhood includes recurring background characters: the Hendersons who leave their Christmas lights up until March, and Mrs. Milkovich who walks an ancient beagle that has been "dying for approximately six years and shows no signs of actually doing it."
    - Diana's typical workday during the interlude included two ear infections, one broken arm, and a determined four-year-old who tried to convince her he needed a cast despite nothing being wrong with him. Dinner was leftover jollof rice.
    - The morning briefing in AM.1 introduced "Love Potion Number Ten," a rumored new drug sold in small glass corked phials of bubbling pink liquid that produces heart-shaped smoke when uncorked and allegedly induces love for a day or two. Patriot's concern was that someone would use it to "roofie Drexel sophomores." No confirmed cases existed at the time of the briefing.
    - Mitchell's closing thought in the interlude is a resolve to "wring the answers out of Maya myself. Non-violently, of course" -- the qualifier serving as both humor and a genuine reflection of his restraint-oriented character.
