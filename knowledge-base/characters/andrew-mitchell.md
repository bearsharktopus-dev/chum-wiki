## Background

Andrew Mitchell is a metahuman from Trenton, New Jersey, who gained his powers approximately ten years before the main story when a fleeing bear mauled him during a solo camping trip in the Pine Barrens. The traumatic encounter served as his activation event, granting him a suite of powers loosely themed around the Jersey Devil of regional folklore: invisible telekinetic claws, echolocation, a fear-inducing aura, and toxic blood. The scar on his chest still itches when he thinks about the Barrens.

Following his activation, Mitchell accidentally killed a civilian while learning to control his abilities - an incident that left a lasting psychological mark and became a core motivator in his superhero career. He adopted the identity of Captain Devil, deliberately styled after tokusatsu heroes and Kamen Rider's "dark hero of justice" archetype. His signature look - a domino mask, large red scarf, and red beret - reflects this aesthetic.

Mitchell was recruited to Argus Corps by Councilwoman Maya Richardson (Interlude MR.4) and publicly unveiled as a founding member at an emergency city council press conference (Ch. 160). All four founding members had prior LUMA suspensions and were eligible for reinstatement under a LUMA Reformation Initiative. He relocated to the Philadelphia area to serve on the team, commuting via SEPTA and maintaining a family home in a residential neighborhood.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Invisible Telekinetic Claws** - Two invisible telekinetic appendages positioned above his shoulders, each with two torso-sized talons. The claws lack fine dexterity and cannot pierce skin, but are highly effective at destroying property, restraining people, and environmental manipulation (e.g., compacting snow into barricade walls). He can only direct them in broad sweeping gestures and describes them as sitting on his shoulders "like two invisible albatrosses." Sam confirmed they are not biologically attached by spraying diluted pig blood to visualize them (Ch. 191).
- **Echolocation** - Sensory ability allowing navigation and tracking in low-visibility conditions. Smoke bends away from him in clean arcs, and he can find people through zero visibility (demonstrated at the Stheno warehouse, Ch. 163).
- **Fear Aura** - Passively emanates supernatural dread, most effective against animals but also producing instinctual fear in humans. Sam described it as involuntary, gut-level terror distinct from ordinary intimidation.
- **Poisonous, Acidic Blood** - Lime green blood that is both toxic and corrosive, sizzling through gloves on contact. Registers as extremely high blood pressure to Sam's blood sense, making him impossible to miss. Renders him extremely dangerous to bite-based attackers.

### Limitations

- The telekinetic claws lack fine motor control; their utility is limited to blunt force, restraint, property destruction, and environmental manipulation.
- The fear aura functions passively rather than as a directed ability, with variable effectiveness (strongest against animals, weaker against humans).
- The acidic blood is a defensive trait that cannot be weaponized offensively; it protects him from contact-based attackers but grants no ranged capability.

### Training & Skills

- Experienced outdoorsman with years of wilderness survival knowledge, including fire assessment, weather reading, and wildlife behavior interpretation.
- Competent hand-to-hand combatant with possible military or special forces background. Sam noted his measured, professional pursuit style as indicative of formal tactical training (Ch. 191).
- Effective field commander who delegates clearly under pressure, as demonstrated when he overrode Patriot to distribute assignments during the Alice confrontation (Ch. 232).
- Skilled investigator who pieces together intelligence from overheard conversations, meeting notes, and behavioral patterns.

## Personality

Andrew Mitchell presents a striking contrast between his intimidating exterior and his genuine warmth. Tall and physically imposing, he cuts an intentionally fearsome figure as Captain Devil, but beneath the domino mask is a devoted father, an avid tokusatsu/anime nerd, and a man who makes a point of learning support staff names and asking about their families. He follows tokusatsu release forums in his downtime and debates whether he can justify the price of a new Kuuga figure.

His approach to dual identity is deliberate and ritualistic: the scarf and beret go on in the elevator down, and come off into his bag when he leaves. Captain Devil stays in the car; Andrew Mitchell walks through the front door.

Mitchell operates under a persistent "just doing my job" mentality that functions as cognitive dissonance for the morally uncomfortable work Argus Corps requires. He would prefer saving lives defensively to fighting criminals proactively, and struggles with assignments that pit him against people doing more good than harm - such as the Kensington phase-walker who destroys pharmacy fentanyl supplies. The civilian he accidentally killed early in his career informs his cautious approach to every confrontation. He has been described as "really too nice for this team," and the growing contradictions between his moral compass and Argus Corps' direction are building toward a likely defection or resignation.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Jasmine Perez (Turbo Jett) | Teammate / Investigative partner | The two conduct a secret investigation into Maya Richardson's potential Kingdom ties, sharing intelligence in corridors without working cameras. They address each other by first name when off the record. Jett is more impulsive - she stole Patriot's phone to check his browser tabs, prompting Mitchell to hiss her first name in exasperation. Her FBI contact raised questions about why Tremont & Fairfax's lawyer Huang handled both the firm's incorporation and Aaron McKinley's pro bono defense. |
| Richard Johnson (Patriot) | Teammate / Team leader | Mitchell serves under Patriot's command. He deduced that Patriot told Maya about Bulldozer's accusations months earlier. Jett's phone theft revealed Patriot was independently researching barokinesis, Richard Duvall, Councilman Silverstein, and old weather reports - a parallel investigation neither Mitchell nor Jett fully understand. By Arc 16 they have been giving each other shiners, though they can still cooperate tactically. |
| Joshua Pleasants (Miasma) | Teammate | Mitchell finds Miasma cryptic and increasingly distant. Suspects he knows more than he shares but cannot determine his true allegiance. |
| Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Ostensible superior / Investigation target | Mitchell suspects she may be Mrs. Zenith, placing a fifty-fifty probability on the assessment ("Maybe worse"). Maya's view of him as of Arc 16 is dismissive - she mocks his anime hobby but considers all four Argus members weapons that have developed "opinions about who they should be pointed at." |
| Sean McNulty (Bulldozer) | Indirect contact | Mitchell believes Bulldozer's claim that Richardson is Kingdom, relayed through Patriot's team briefing. This intelligence forms the foundation of his secret investigation. |
| Diana Mitchell | Fiancee/Wife | Pediatric clinic worker who tolerates Andrew's camping trips and nerd hobbies, sometimes buying him tokusatsu figures for Christmas despite rolling her eyes. Reads his moods perceptively ("You're thinking too loud") and teases him as "Mr. Dark Hero of Justice." Leaves the front door unlocked despite being asked approximately eight hundred times. They have a warm, stable partnership built on mutual understanding. |
| Malik Mitchell | Son | Ten years old, perfecting the dismissive older sibling routine. Sleeps with a tablet under his pillow. |
| Destiny Mitchell | Daughter | Seven years old, convinced that running is superior to walking. Firmly believes cartwheels should be a superpower. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary (professional) | Mitchell has pursued and fought Sam on multiple occasions but conducts these confrontations with restraint - offering chances to surrender and declining to pursue into civilian areas. Miasma identified him as a potential threat to Sam during her fugitive period. |
| Marcus (Security Guard) | Colleague (support staff) | Front desk guard at Argus Corps HQ. Mitchell asks about his family; Marcus's daughter Tamika made the Dean's List at Temple. |
| Rosario (Dispatch) | Colleague (support staff) | Dispatch operator at Argus Corps HQ. One of the support staff Mitchell makes a point of engaging with personally. |
| Jenkins (Tech Support) | Colleague (support staff) | Argus Corps tech support, often working on Jett's backup suit. His maintenance backlog left corridor cameras non-functional - a fact Mitchell and Jett exploit for private conversations. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Recruited by Maya Richardson during a private meeting at a rented coworking space (Interlude MR.4), where Richardson appealed to him stepping back into the light and being who he really is. Arrived fifteen minutes late and remained the most reserved and detached of the four recruits, saying little but described by the narration as someone who "doesn't say much, but he feels everything." Publicly introduced as a founding member of Argus Corps at Richardson's emergency city council press conference (Ch. 160), described as a big Black man in a red scarf, duster, and domino mask. Named in the confidential Argus Corps formation proposal as Andrew "Captain Devil" Mitchell, categorized under "supernatural sensory enhancement, telekinetic combat" (Interlude MR.5). Participates in the Argus Corps raid on the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse (Ch. 163-164): specifically assigned by Patriot to pursue Soot, while Turbo Jett handles Bash, Miasma takes Sam, and Patriot mops up Lenny and the guards. His fear aura creates an instinctive "predator" feeling in Sam upon arrival, and he moves through dense smoke effortlessly, the smoke bending away from him in clean arcs. The warehouse is ultimately destroyed by Soot's chemical chain reaction, and the Auditors escape. Subsequently discussed by the Auditors as they investigate the legal connections behind Argus Corps, particularly the discovery that Tremont & Fairfax lawyer Katherine Huang filed paperwork for both Aaron McKinley's defense and the Argus Corps formation.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as part of Argus Corps' expanding operations during the post-Stheno period. The team's public prominence increases under Richardson's direction as they conduct anti-vigilante enforcement and drug-distribution raids across Philadelphia. Captain Devil is noted in the heavily redacted Argus Corps after-action report from the warehouse incident.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present during the Argus Corps team briefing where Patriot reveals Bulldozer's accusations against Richardson (Interlude RJ.2). Described as "cautiously concerned" about the allegations while Jett is dismissive and Miasma is suspiciously neutral. Confronts Sam at Richardson's town hall event (Chapters 191-192), giving her an opportunity to surrender before engaging. Sam describes him as broad-shouldered with a deep voice, red scarf, domino mask on dark skin, and a newsboy cap. Reveals four powers during the fight, though only two are fully demonstrated: invisible extendable talons with two fingers each (torso-sized, strong enough to buckle metal but not biologically attached to him) and acidic blood (lime green, sizzles through Sam's gloves). Two additional powers remain unspecified. Sam sprays diluted pig blood from a spritzer bottle to visualize his talons and uses her blood sense to track his abnormally high blood pressure. Mitchell pursues Sam through City Hall corridors at a steady pace rather than sprinting, displaying a measured professional approach consistent with military or special forces training. His claws damage marble floors as he moves. Maggie (Flashpoint) bodyslams him at full speed with her force fields - a "human missile" impact to his back that knocks him flying. Sam jumps from a second-floor window onto an awning and tumbles to the ground, where Lily is waiting with a scooter. Mitchell watches from the window and chooses not to pursue once Sam and Maggie reach a public area with civilians, citing concern about collateral damage.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as part of Argus Corps' ongoing operations during the Daedalus prison break crisis and the subsequent Shrike emergence in Northeast Philadelphia. No direct scenes.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Argus Corps commits "100% of resources" to hunting the serial killer Shrike after he escalates from dead birds to targeting schools and breaking into Sam's home. Argus Corps establishes checkpoints on major Northeast Philadelphia roads with Shrike's mugshots. The team is referenced operating at full capacity during the crisis.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Argus Corps confronts Sam with an arrest warrant for unlicensed vigilantism, B&E, stalking, and reckless endangerment (Chapter 222), though Patriot and Turbo Jett handle the direct confrontation while Mitchell is not present for the chase. Miasma warns Sam during her fugitive period that Captain Devil is a potential threat alongside Patriot and Jett (Chapter 225). Present at the cordon during the Alice confrontation at Maya's Mayfair residence (Chapter 227), his red scarf fluttering in nonexistent wind. He speaks to an overwhelmed police officer and helps Maya after the incident in a "gentle and concerned" voice, while Patriot orders both Sam and Alice detained. During the operation to intercept Alice the following day (Chapter 232), Captain Devil takes tactical command when Patriot and Jett disagree on priorities, issuing clear orders: "Miasma, you cover Maya. I'll block the route. Jett, you handle the civvies." He uses his invisible claws to rake snow and ice from sidewalks and compact them into barricade walls while Miasma loads Alice (in Maya's form) into an unmarked car and drives away - unknowingly delivering the shapeshifter directly into Miasma's custody. Sam fires a pepper spray canister that Jett swats into Captain Devil's snow wall. Mitchell is unaware that the entire operation was orchestrated by Miasma's mole network to separate Alice from the real Argus Corps team.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up (AM.1)"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude)

    The focus character of Interlude AM.1, which provides the only extended first-person perspective of Mitchell's life. The interlude opens with a detailed flashback to his activation event in the Pine Barrens, depicting the wildfire, the mass animal exodus, and the bear mauling with its cub. Transitions to a full day in his current life: his SEPTA commute (checking tokusatsu forums, saving Diana's breakfast photo of the kids), the morning briefing at Argus Corps headquarters where Patriot assigns Jett to a Gray's Ferry ribbon-cutting, Mitchell to the Kensington phase-walker follow-up, and Miasma to narcotics coordination. The briefing also covers the Turnout armored car robbery pattern on I-95 (third robbery that month, same two exits, suggesting inside information) and a new drug called "Love Potion Number Ten" - small glass corked phials of bubbling pink liquid producing heart-shaped smoke, allegedly inducing love for a day or two. Mitchell and Jett conduct their secret investigation in corridors without working cameras: Jett's FBI contact found Tremont & Fairfax to be aggressively cooperative but the Fairfax connection "boringly, aggressively clean," with the central question being why a New York megafirm took pro bono defense of Aaron McKinley, a two-bit Philly arsonist. Jett stole Patriot's unlocked phone during his bathroom break, revealing his research tabs: an American Institute of Dynology article on barokinesis, encyclopedia articles on Tyrannosaurus Rex and Richard Duvall, Duvall's high school yearbook, stock reports, two-year-old weather reports, and an article on Councilman Silverstein. Mitchell revealed he had deduced that Patriot told Maya Richardson about Bulldozer's accusations months earlier, right after McNulty brought them to him. The failed Kensington search (the phase-walker had varied his pattern, not hitting the same area twice) and the evening at home with Diana, Malik, and Destiny follow, ending with Mitchell's resolve to find the truth about Maya - "non-violently, of course."

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Continues operating with Argus Corps. Investigating Maya Richardson alongside Turbo Jett, keeping their inquiry secret because he does not know who to trust. Believes Bulldozer's intelligence about Maya being Kingdom. Maxwell Martinez notes Argus Corps hitting three Rogue Wave distribution points in one week, identifying this as Maya's PR strategy to keep the team "visible" (Chapter 235). Present as part of the Argus Corps backup that Miasma arranges when Mr. Nothing intercepts Sam on the Broad Street Line subway (Chapter 246) - Devil is already on the scene when Patriot steps in to rescue Sam, with Jett being rerouted and Miasma intercepting the train. At the Argus Corps oversight transition meeting in the City Hall conference room (Interlude MR.10), visibly checked out and on his phone - a detail Maya notes with irritation, asking whether he is reading leaks from "one of your stupid Japanese import shows again." Maya observes that Patriot and Captain Devil have been giving each other shiners, a dynamic she claims to have designed deliberately by building the team with incompatible personalities. The meeting formalizes the transfer of Argus Corps oversight from Richardson to a council committee co-chaired by Silverstein and Davis, effective April 1st. Miasma is notably absent from the meeting - Maya is ninety-nine percent certain he has turned against her.


## Trivia

- Interlude AM.1 opens with lyrics from the original Kamen Rider theme song and closes with Foo Fighters' "My Hero."
- His Kuuga figure debate during the SEPTA commute places his fandom squarely in the Heisei era of Kamen Rider.
- His fear aura's effectiveness on animals is consistent with the Jersey Devil folklore, which traditionally describes a creature that terrorizes livestock and wildlife.
- During the Pine Barrens flashback, Mitchell recognized the bear was not predatory - it was a mother fleeing with its cub. They were thinking the same thing: protecting their families. He was "just in the way."
- As of Arc 16, at least three Argus Corps members are independently investigating Maya Richardson: Mitchell and Jett work together, Patriot investigates alone, and Miasma operates as a full mole. None are aware of the full scope of the others' inquiries.
- His neighborhood includes recurring background characters: the Hendersons who leave their Christmas lights up until March, and Mrs. Milkovich who walks an ancient beagle that has been "dying for approximately six years and shows no signs of actually doing it."
- Diana's typical workday during the interlude included two ear infections, one broken arm, and a determined four-year-old who tried to convince her he needed a cast despite nothing being wrong with him. Dinner was leftover jollof rice.
- The AM.1 morning briefing introduced "Love Potion Number Ten" - small glass corked phials of bubbling pink liquid that produces heart-shaped smoke and allegedly induces love for a day or two. No confirmed cases existed at the time.
