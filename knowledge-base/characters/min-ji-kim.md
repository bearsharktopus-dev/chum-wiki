## Background

Min-ji Kim is a Korean-American metahuman who operates under the codename Moonshot as the bruiser and mobility specialist of the Tacony Titans, a young vigilante team based in Northeast Philadelphia. At twenty-two, she is the oldest member and functions as the team's adult figure, providing a steadying, professional presence.

The daughter of hardworking Korean immigrants, Min-ji balances family responsibilities with her heroic ambitions. The specifics of her activation event have not been detailed. She likely works part-time or attends college in addition to Titans duties. Her family background instilled a strong work ethic and sense of duty that define her role as the team's most physically imposing combatant and most reliable aerial asset.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Personal Gravity Manipulation** - Can manipulate her own gravitational field, becoming lighter, heavier, or changing the direction of gravitational pull on her body. Creates localized gravitational fields centered on herself, potentially causing visible light distortion.
- **Simulated Flight** - Reduces personal gravity and redirects its vector to launch through the air with considerable speed and control. Provides aerial reconnaissance and high-velocity combat entrances.
- **Mass-Enhanced Strikes** - Increases personal mass at the moment of impact to amplify kinetic energy, functioning as the team's primary close-quarters combatant.
- **Gravity-Assisted Mobility** - Rapid directional changes, controlled descents, vertical surface scaling, and rooftop-to-rooftop leaps. Can carry passengers while ascending buildings.
- **Gravity-Enhanced Tool Use** - Channels gravity manipulation through held objects, adding gravitational force to swings (e.g., shattering reinforced glass with a hammer).

### Limitations

- Min-ji's gravity manipulation appears to be limited to her own person and objects in her immediate physical contact. There is no evidence she can project gravitational fields at range or affect other people's gravity.
- The caloric demands of gravity manipulation may be significant; fliers typically require two to three times normal caloric intake.
- Specific upper limits on how much she can increase or decrease her mass, or the maximum velocity she can achieve in flight, have not been documented.
- She is a baseline human outside of her gravity manipulation; she does not possess enhanced durability, regeneration, or other secondary physical enhancements.

### Training & Skills

- Experienced in coordinated multi-team operations alongside the Auditors and other vigilante groups.
- Proficient in aerial reconnaissance and tactical positioning; frequently serves as the Titans' eyes in the sky.

## Personality

Min-ji is calm, professional, and reserved, with a dry sense of humor that surfaces in understated moments. She focuses on executing plans with precision rather than overanalyzing, making her reliable in high-pressure scenarios. While she may appear distant, she is deeply committed to protecting her teammates.

Her demeanor counterbalances the more volatile personalities on the Titans. She does not seek the spotlight or assert authority through charisma; instead, she leads by example through consistent performance and quiet dependability.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First appeared in Chapter 72, arriving as a last-minute reinforcement during the battle against Ricochet by crashing through a wall opening like a missile and colliding with Ricochet horizontally. Formally identified in Chapter 73 as Moonshot, hovering above the scene in opaque goggles, hoodie, and protective pads, and helped handcuff Ricochet while Sam provided a distraction. Participated in the alliance formation meeting at the Titans' garage headquarters in Chapter 80, where her gravity manipulation abilities were formally revealed. During the weeklong stakeout of Squeal's apartment, tracked Squeal from rooftops using gravity-assisted leaps and carried Bubble through the air to the Dobson Mills operation site. Engaged in the Dobson Mills warehouse battle in Chapter 81 alongside Compass and the combined hero teams, where both were blown into walls by Sparkplug's massive electric burst. Jordan protected Compass and Moonshot from approaching goons during the chaos. In Chapter 82, was present at the scene when paramedics treated Kate's injuries following the battle. During the joint meeting in Chapter 83, suggested that Team Mayfly take on tech support and surveillance roles rather than field operations - a compromise that was accepted. Played a key role in the Sparkplug penthouse infiltration in Chapter 84, carrying Sam up the side of the Dorchester building in a blanket using gravity manipulation, then weakening and shattering the reinforced penthouse window with a nail-welded hammer enhanced by gravity. After the operation, extracted Sam from the building by making her lighter, and was credited by Sam as essential to the insertion and extraction.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Referenced by name in Chapter 131 during the multi-team planning meeting at the hospital following Devonte's shooting. Sundial stated that she, Moonshot, and Compass would reach out to other street teams in the city ahead of Operation Ivory, noting that the Tacony Titans were not the only unlicensed team available to assist.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Arrived at the coffee shop arson scene in Chapter 140, descending in a slow arc with flight goggles and sliding along the ground steplessly, offering backup alongside Compass during the Aaron McKinley investigation. Her entrance was cool and professional - "Heard you might need backup." Observed by Sam in Chapter 146 soaring low between rooftops while Sam walked through a Philadelphia gripped by copycat fires, civilian patrols, and civil unrest during the citywide crisis.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Titans referenced as one of three major vigilante factions alongside the Auditors and Pattinson's Pals during the escalating conflict with Argus Corps.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Observed by Sam intervening in a mugging during an evening patrol in Chapter 193, dropping in at terminal velocity to grab both muggers by their collars and deposit them on a nearby roof while Sam was limited to providing first aid to the victim due to her post-confrontation restrictions. Moonshot's ability to operate freely contrasted with Sam's constrained status during this period. Throughout the arc, Moonshot appeared in Auditors group chat patrol reports as an active presence in coordinated neighborhood patrols - stopping a mugging in Kensington (Chapter 195), patrolling with Bubble and Auditors members (Chapter 196), reporting uneventful patrols during a heightened alert period (Chapter 198), and joining coordinated patrols with Sundial and Auditors (Chapter 201).

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Listed among the Tacony Titans overwhelmed with storm response during the Maya Richardson-engineered blizzard in Chapter 229. Moonshot was assigned to sweep the Cottman corridor while Sandman coordinated from base and Compass and Bubble handled residential check-ins. The Titans had been doing search and rescue since before dawn - handling car accidents, people without power, and medical emergencies - and were now facing a wave of commercial break-ins. Sundial requested Auditors assistance with coverage, and a shared communication channel was established between the two teams.


## Trivia

- Her codename likely references both her gravity-based powers and the explosive, projectile-like manner in which she enters combat.
- The Tacony Titans are described as "the boy scouts of Tacony" - the defensive, reactive counterpart to the Auditors' proactive approach. Min-ji's professionalism embodies this philosophy.
- Her gravity manipulation falls under the Adjust classification in PERKS (modifies existing variables) with a Self targeting type.
- Current status as of Arc 16 is noted simply as presumably working and handling school.
