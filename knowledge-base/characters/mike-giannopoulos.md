## Background

Mike Giannopoulos is a student at Tacony Charter Academy and the school's star quarterback. He first emerged as a significant figure during the Pattinson's Pals crisis in Book 7, when he physically fought security guard Kowalski at the school -- a confrontation in which Jordan Westwood subtly aided him by warping space without Mike's knowledge.

Mike's defining moment came during the homecoming dance attack, when Patriot, Egalitarian, and a squad of police officers stormed the gymnasium. After Egalitarian deployed her vertigo power and Patriot began beating Sam, Mike was among the students who staggered to their feet and formed a human shield around Sam and Jordan in a "Spartacus moment," alongside teacher Mr. Weston, Officer Nguyen, and student Melissa Marshall. Mike physically grabbed Patriot's leg during the beating to stop the assault on Sam, an act of extraordinary courage from a non-powered civilian against a superhuman.

Following the homecoming incident, Mike approached Sam at school and informed her about an upcoming protest march, connecting her to the broader civilian resistance movement forming in response to the Pattinson's Pals' escalating intimidation.

## Powers & Abilities

Mike Giannopoulos has no metahuman abilities. He is a baseline human whose contributions are entirely based on physical courage, social capital, and moral conviction.

### Training & Skills

- Star quarterback for Tacony Charter Academy's football team, providing both physical fitness and significant social standing at the school.
- Demonstrated willingness to physically confront authority figures (security guard Kowalski) and superhuman threats (Patriot) in defense of fellow students.

## Personality

Mike represents the non-powered civilian who refuses to be a bystander. His willingness to fight security guard Kowalski over the treatment of students and to physically grab a superhuman's leg during a beating demonstrates both courage and an instinctive moral compass. His approach to Sam after the homecoming incident -- informing her about the protest march rather than retreating into fear -- shows he channels his conviction into organized civic action rather than impulsive bravado.

## Trivia

- The plot thread tracker (Thread 37, Books 6-7) explicitly notes that a non-powered civilian standing up to a superhuman to protect someone is "thematically powerful" in the story, and that Mike "represents the ordinary people who resist oppression alongside the metahumans."
- His role as star quarterback gives him social capital at school that the thread analysis notes "could be politically useful."
- Jordan's subtle use of space-warping powers to help Mike fight Kowalski represents one of the more restrained and clever applications of Jordan's abilities in the story.
- Mike is distinct from Mike D'Ambrosio, the Songbird leader who appears in Book 16.
