## Background

Mike Giannopoulos is a student at Tacony Charter Academy and the school's star quarterback. He emerged as a significant figure during the Pattinson's Pals crisis in Book 7, first fighting security guard Kowalski over invasive pat-downs (Ch. 106), then becoming the first person to physically intervene against Patriot during the homecoming dance attack (Ch. 112) - grabbing Patriot's leg while retching from Egalitarian's vertigo and inspiring the school-wide "Spartacus moment" that forced Patriot's retreat. Afterward, he connected Sam to the broader civilian protest movement (Ch. 113).

## Powers & Abilities

Mike Giannopoulos has no metahuman abilities. His star quarterback status gives him both physical fitness and significant social standing at the school.

## Personality

Mike represents the non-powered civilian who refuses to be a bystander. He has an instinctive moral compass and the physical courage to act on it - confronting both authority figures and superhuman threats in defense of fellow students. Rather than retreating into fear after the homecoming attack, he channeled his conviction into organized civic action by connecting Sam to the protest movement.

## Trivia

- The plot thread tracker (Thread 37, Books 6-7) notes that a non-powered civilian standing up to a superhuman is "thematically powerful" and that Mike "represents the ordinary people who resist oppression alongside the metahumans."
- Jordan's subtle space-warping to help Mike fight Kowalski is one of the more restrained and clever applications of Jordan's abilities.
- Mike is distinct from Mike D'Ambrosio, the Songbird leader who appears in Book 16.
