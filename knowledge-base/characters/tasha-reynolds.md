## Background

Tasha Reynolds is one of Sam Small's closest friends, part of her original middle school group alongside Kate Smith, Marcus Johnson, Lilly Rodriguez, and Jenna Nguyen. Known as the group's analytical mind, she wears thick-rimmed glasses, keeps a leather notebook, and is always scribbling notes. Her mother, Natalie Reynolds, is a nurse (RN) at Temple Health, and her father, James Reynolds, is an academic. Tasha's interest in physiology and emergency medicine stems from reading medical textbooks for fun and her mother's career.

Before the Auditors, Tasha served as "Ant" on Kate Smith's Team Mayfly - a non-powered vigilante squad using insect-themed codenames, improvised gadgets, and a mini-drone fleet called "the Swarm." She monitored police scanners, programmed drone formations, and built a fully mechanical pepper spray wrist canister. When Sam discovered Team Mayfly, the team was folded into her operations, restricted to recon and tech support.

Tasha transitioned into the Auditors as Sam's primary civilian support operative, handling field medicine, logistics, comms, intelligence analysis, and drone operations. She received the codename "Lighthouse" from Sam during the Shrike crisis (Chapter 206) and debuted a custom costume at the community center grand opening (Chapter 234). In November 2025, she was seriously injured when the Kingdom contractor Garbage Day attacked the Music Hall, deliberately dislocating her left shoulder. Despite the attack, she secretly planted a BugTag tracker in his jacket, providing critical intelligence on his location. She recovered at Temple University Hospital (4-6 weeks in a sling) and was out of the sling by early January 2026.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file. Tasha Reynolds is a baseline human with no metahuman abilities.

### Abilities

- **N/A** - Tasha possesses no superhuman powers. Her contributions to the Auditors are entirely skill-based.

### Limitations

- **No Superhuman Durability** - As a baseline human, Tasha is vulnerable to injury in ways her powered teammates are not. This was demonstrated when Garbage Day deliberately targeted her as the weakest physical link during the Music Hall attack.
- **Non-Combatant** - Tasha is not trained for direct combat and relies on her teammates for physical protection during field operations.

### Training & Skills

- Field medicine and emergency care, influenced by her mother's nursing career and her own study of anatomy and physiology.
- Communications and intelligence coordination: police scanners, drone operation, traffic cameras, radio management.
- Mechanical engineering aptitude (built a custom pepper spray wrist canister for Team Mayfly).
- Research and OSINT skills: property records, social media cross-referencing, open-source intelligence. Led the Songbirds investigation, identifying them as an astroturfed radicalization pipeline.
- Primary drone operator for the Auditors, inherited from Team Mayfly's "Swarm" system.

## Personality

Tasha is practical, blunt, and deeply loyal. Often the most cautious voice in planning discussions, she advocates for restraint and risk assessment but commits fully once a decision is made. Described as a "mother hen," she fusses over her teammates' physical well-being and is unafraid to call out Sam when she is being reckless.

Beneath her composed exterior, she privately struggles with self-harm, concealed by consistently wearing long sleeves. Not even Sam knew until the Garbage Day attack exposed old and newer scars on her forearms. She has a fondness for bugs, centipedes, and creatures most people find unsettling - she keeps pet centipedes and enjoys sharing bug facts. She possesses a sharp, dry wit, as when she caught Crossroads off guard by asking "Are you saying that because I'm black?" before the whole room cracked up.

    When Garbage Day attacks, Sam and Tasha flee to the third floor and kill the breaker box. Tasha hits the attacker with a board piece, yelling "Center mass!"

Plants a BugTag tracker in Garbage Day's jacket pocket while flailing at him, before the dislocation - a critical piece of intelligence.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Attends the community center grand opening, where she debuts her Lighthouse costume for the first time - showing Sam around in the blue-and-white outfit with mechanical arm brace and leashed drone. Conducts deep-dive research into the Songbirds from the center office, cross-referencing neighborhood watch Facebook groups with Songbird event photos to identify the radicalization pipeline. Discovers that Mike D'Ambrosio had zero anti-powered online presence before October, confirming the Songbirds as an astroturfed operation rather than an organic grassroots movement. Notes the etymological connection - "A Shrike is a kind of songbird" - suggesting a possible rebranding of Shrike's ideology. Provides intelligence support during Auditors' Faraday room briefings. Assigned deep Songbird research including forums, money trail, and drone surveillance. Raises the possibility that the Songbird bounty on Sam and the Bellwether drug operation are unconnected, since the Songbirds were already escalating independently. Calls 911 from a school bathroom during the Songbird confrontation at the community center. Assists Sam with surveillance file research, going through 63 photos and timestamped observations. Identified as one of the many independent threads in Sam's "mousetrap strategy" against Maya Richardson - a thread that would continue operating regardless of what happened to Sam.


## Trivia

- Sam explained the Lighthouse codename: "You guide us, keep us from crashing on the rocks."
- Tasha gets her face and eyesight from her father.
- Her role as "Ant" on Team Mayfly directly prefigured her Lighthouse role for the Auditors.
- After the Garbage Day attack, Sam's measured response to learning about the BugTag tracker prompted Tasha to quip: "Who are you and what did you do with Sam?"
