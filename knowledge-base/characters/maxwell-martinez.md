## Background

Maxwell Martinez received a JLUMA (Juvenile Licensed Use of Metahuman Abilities) in 2020 after presenting his precognitive abilities. Early attempts at independent heroism left him with more than a few injuries, but these setbacks developed his realistic understanding of his capabilities. He joined the Young Defenders as the team's original leader before the leadership chain shifted to Liberty Belle, then Puppeteer.

When Puppeteer entered inpatient psychiatric treatment in 2023, Maxwell resumed acting leadership. Puppeteer permanently turned over YD leadership upon her return. Liberty Belle had deliberately avoided his precognition by reading his PERKS file, preventing him from foreseeing her terminal cancer diagnosis. His PERKS interviewing officer noted his consistent growth and predicted he would be tapped for a formal leadership role.

In 2024, following the Phreaks' courthouse attack, Maxwell emerged as the sole viable graduation candidate after Gale stepped back and Puppeteer disclosed a condition precluding registry beyond a LUMA. He graduated to the senior Delaware Valley Defenders roster, with Rampart succeeding him as YD leader, and continued serving as tactical coordinator and dispatcher while studying metahuman law in college.

In late 2025, Mrs. Heartbeat attacked him at his apartment while he was providing intelligence for Sam's raids against the Kingdom. He survived with multiple gunshot and stab wounds, recovered at the Small family home for approximately three months, and returned to his college dorm once his shoulder reached 80-85% mobility.

### Abilities

- **Discrete Outcome Prediction** - Perceives and predicts outcomes of inflection points where a decision or action results in a limited set of discrete outcomes. A coin flip shows two futures branching at the moment of landing, and he can push his perception forward into both branches simultaneously. Works best with binary choices (e.g., coin flips) and remains effective up to six possible outcomes. Beyond six, predictions become unreliable. When a branch abruptly cuts off, it indicates something removes him from decision space in that timeline - unconsciousness or death. Death specifically would produce a distinct "jolt."
- **Accelerated Perception** - Perceives future events at a rate approximately 201.67 times faster than normal. A few seconds of concentration can yield insights into outcomes occurring minutes to hours ahead.
- **Multi-Sensory Visions** - Predictions are experienced in the mind's eye but encompass all senses, providing a comprehensive perception of potential outcomes. He can function normally while experiencing future visions, though this was difficult when his powers first manifested.
- **Precommitment Exploitation** - Uses information theory and precommitment strategies to extract maximum value from his predictions. Carries coins at all times to flip, reading the outcomes from both sides simultaneously to decide on future actions. This technique effectively doubles the information gained from each use of his power.
- **Overclocking** - Can push his abilities into a continuous future-vision state approximately two to three seconds ahead of real time. This grants significant combat advantages, allowing him to anticipate and react to attacks before they occur. Whether this is a specialized form of his primary power or a secondary ability remains undetermined.

### Limitations

- **Temporal Clarity Degradation** - Predictions are most accurate and detailed within the first 15 minutes of future sight. Clarity decreases sharply beyond this point, becoming vague after 30 minutes and entirely incomprehensible after 2 hours of perceived time.
- **Discrete Outcome Cap** - Accuracy is highest with binary choices and decreases as the number of potential outcomes increases, becoming unreliable beyond six discrete possibilities.
- **Overclocking Strain** - Using the overclocked ability causes significant physical strain, typically resulting in nosebleeds and, if pushed further, blood from the eyes. Extended use risks internal hemorrhage and severe stamina drain.
- **Mental Concentration** - The ability requires significant concentration, with effectiveness reduced in high-stress or distracting environments.
- **Non-Interactive Visions** - Visions are strictly observational. He cannot interact with or alter events within his visions, though he can change his current plans based on what he foresees.
- **Temporal Horizon** - If physical obstacles consume too much real time (such as clearing booby-trapped locations one by one), the future vision cannot reach far enough ahead to be useful. This was demonstrated during the Shrike crisis when his predictions could not help pre-check barbed-wire-trapped addresses because each location took too long to clear.

### Training & Skills

- Trained in tactical planning, field leadership, and mission coordination through years of YD and DVD service.
- Strong background in information theory, applied intuitively to maximize his predictive abilities.
- Athletic and physically capable, though not a primary combatant. Can hold his own in close quarters using overclocked precognition (Arc 3, Arc 15).
- Studying international metahuman law in college.
- Knows first aid, CPR, and lifeguarding. Mandated first aid training for YD members during his leadership tenure.

## Personality

Maxwell is extremely quiet, thoughtful, and responsible, carrying himself with a soft-spoken politeness that some find slightly eerie. Sam notes he is "quieter than Playback all the time" and that "it's scary." He has a signature behavior of staring at where people will be several seconds from now rather than where they currently are. Extraordinarily decisive despite being a precognitive - a contradiction of the typical "indecisive seer" archetype. He uses his powers to navigate social encounters, gathering information from branches of conversation that never actually occur, though he will stop if it makes someone uncomfortable.

He self-imposes strict ethical limits on his abilities. Deeply religious as a Catholic, though he does not discuss faith in professional contexts, his philosophy holds that he was given his powers to do good, not to "save-scum" life. He has strong Fourth Amendment principles - he initially refused to use precognition to locate Aaron McKinley without probable cause (Arc 9) and rejected a kitchen knife as too lethal during Mrs. Heartbeat's assassination attempt (Arc 15), drawing a firm moral line even in life-or-death situations.

A steadfast ally who places great trust in those he believes in, he calls Sam his "impulsive little sister" and "comrade." During the courthouse protest crisis (Arc 6), he navigated moral gray area by refusing to take sides - walking away rather than confront civilians while feeding tactical intel to Multiplex via earpiece. His character flaws are subtle and difficult to identify without extended close contact. At social gatherings, he serves as a quiet guardian angel, defusing social landmines. His cousin Emily calls him a "buzzkill" but an indispensable one.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Teammate / Surrogate Sister | Calls Sam his "impulsive little sister" and "comrade." Their partnership deepens across the story from YD teammates to strategic allies during Sam's fugitive period and Kingdom raids. Recovered at the Small family home for approximately three months. Departed with: "You built something good. Let it work." |
| Emily & Lilly Rodriguez | Second Cousin | Related through Emily's mom's cousin's son. Gets roped into babysitting and chaperoning Rodriguez family parties. Emily calls him "Max" and describes him as a "buzzkill." |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Introduced as a member of the Young Defenders during Sam's first visit to DVD headquarters (Ch. 5). Described as the tallest in the group, stretched out like an old tree, with a sickly pallor, yellow-brown eyes that stare through people, and very long dark hair longer than most girls. His costume is a black undersuit with orange-red padding. When asked about his power, he says simply "I see the future" and does not elaborate. Mostly silent during initial introductions - chuckles "Chauvinist" at Rampart's "ladies first" comment (Ch. 6). Takes quiet command in emergencies, ordering "Get her upright, Pup" when Sam collapses during training. Working out with Gossamer during baseline assessments.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Assumes acting leadership of the Young Defenders during Puppeteer's absence. During the team meeting reviewing Alex Garcia's drone footage of the Kingdom (Ch. 15), he is the last to enter the locker room, stays distant from banter, and exhibits his signature behavior of staring at where people will be five seconds from now. His eyes dart back and forth "like a candle in a gusty wind" while reading futures frantically during the footage, then calms. Turns off the lights for the screening.

    When Puppeteer assaults Sam over Liberty Belle's cancer secret (Ch. 19), Maxwell's body is shaking and his eyes are glassy with tears - he already knew LB's secret from his future sight and had been holding it in. Ends the crisis with two authoritative lines: "No. Go take a nap." Puppeteer listens and falls asleep within seconds from extreme sleep deprivation. Blink squeezes his arm for support during the scene.

    At Lilly Rodriguez's pre-Halloween birthday party (Ch. 23), his civilian name is revealed. Attends in a $20 Spirit Halloween Superman costume. He is Emily Rodriguez's second cousin (Emily's mom's cousin's son) and serves as party guardian angel, moving through the crowd defusing social landmines. Recognizes Jordan Westwood as Safeguard from their BLAME! manga costume and confronts Sam privately about keeping the secret. Proposes that Jordan help investigate the Kingdom as an unfamiliar face. Knew Jordan was hiding in the closet during the conversation and chose that room deliberately.

    Drives Sam and Jordan to the Crescent nightclub in his rusty '90s sedan (Ch. 24), briefs them on Kingdom structure (boss, underbosses, capos, soldiers, associates), and monitors the operation via earpiece from near the entrance. Warns them when his visual branches start showing firefights. After Mrs. Heartbeat induces bradycardia in Sam and Mr. Tyrannosaur threatens Jordan, Maxwell extracts them and drives a circuitous route home through West Philly to avoid tails. Calls the mission an "unambiguous victory."

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Leads the tactical briefing and assigns combat roles for the South Street operation against the Philly Phreaks (Ch. 32): Bloodhound and Rampart on frontline, Puppeteer and Blink on area control and denial, Playback on audio control and provocation, Gale on harrying and projectile interception. Jamal leaves the tactics to Crossroads. During the fight itself (Ch. 33), calls out tactical moves in real-time ("Bee! Left, duck! Now, right!") and engages Patches directly, "dancing" with surgical precision and perfectly anticipating every move. Gets a nosebleed from power use but seems invigorated by it, "like a computer being overclocked." Engages in a psychic standoff with Deathgirl where both get nosebleeds. Flags badly by the end - moves become "tired, delayed shuffles," dizzy, swaying, leaning on a car to avoid passing out.

    Discusses the aftermath at HQ (Ch. 34), defending the team's approach: "I don't think de-escalation was ever in the cards." Uses a family dinner excuse to help set up Sam's concert attendance. Already had an emergency pager before the rest of the Young Defenders received theirs from Fury Forge. Asks about Kingdom motives in relation to the Chernobyl crisis. Plans a tactical session for the following day. Has a secret handshake with Rampart. Liberty Belle identifies (via Crossroads' reports) that Jordan has been covering Sam's tradecraft gaps in the field (Ch. 37).

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Had precognitive visions of the NSRA attempting to confiscate Belle's investigative materials from Sam (Ch. 48). Met Miasma after Belle's burial and exchanged contacts, then tipped off Miasma to intervene on Sam's behalf. Sam notes that "keeping secrets around Crossroads isn't really possible."

    On Sam's return to HQ after weeks of absence following Liberty Belle's death (Ch. 49), Crossroads announces that Dr. Leonard Harris from the NSRA will be coming for power evaluations the following month. Sam tries to dodge, but Crossroads sees through it - Sam notes "Crossroads knows, I know he knows, he knows I know he knows." He now has braids (Gale blows them out of place with a hand fan playfully). Corrects Spindle on the term "diversion program" - his idea to give Spindle a shot at rehabilitation through probation, check-ins, and community service.

    At the New Year's Eve party at DVD headquarters (Ch. 53), he cleaned the HQ for the event and wears jeans and a tee. Gives a New Year's toast: "We've seen some tough times, lost people we cared about, but we've also seen what we're capable of when we work together." When Sam reveals her torture and new powers to the team, triggering a panic attack, Crossroads uses his precognition to navigate the situation - having "probably seen this conversation dozens of times already" - and manages it with "You heard her. Sam, go take ten outside." Sam trusts his judgment and goes.

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Visits Sam alongside Gale and Gossamer during her recovery (Ch. 65). Described as having broad shoulders, braids, and carrying the weight of leadership since Liberty Belle's death. Provides updates on the team's post-subway shootout progress and reports that things have been "just the right amount of quiet."

    Present at Sam's 15th birthday party (Ch. 68) alongside Blink, Gossamer, and Puppeteer as part of the Young Defenders delegation. Attends while Playback, Rampart, and Gale are absent on patrols and missions.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    During the Ricochet fight (Ch. 72-73), sends an alert through the Young Defenders group chat that he and Playback are handling it. Serves as stoic leader with handcuffs as his primary tool and preternatural foresight. Calls Miss Mayfly by her codename when ordering Playback to help the injured gadgeteer. After the fight, reprimands Sam for disobeying a direct order but tempers it: "It's okay. I would be more surprised if you didn't. And please don't call me sir." Separately dresses down Miss Mayfly for her amateur approach, explaining that her stink bombs and pepper spray complicated Playback's sound-based tactics and that the original plan - holding Ricochet steady while Playback silently applied handcuffs - could have secured the drugs before Ricochet consumed them. Does coin tricks while lecturing. Has a personal connection to Sundial, who knows his mom and sees her at the market.

    Presents the Fly drug briefing to the Young Defenders (Ch. 74) after receiving an NSRA memo he technically does not have clearance to share, summarizing instead. The atmosphere shifts instantly when he enters - "cold front sweeping in." He drags a metal folding chair screeching across the tile and appears shaken, which is unusual for him. Reveals key intel: "Fly gives people superpowers. Even if you never had them." Reports that the drug epidemic is spreading across NYC, DC, and Baltimore. When the ethical debate between Playback and Puppeteer gets heated, he contributes "Superpowers don't discriminate based on who you are or what you've done" before shutting down the argument entirely with a single word: "Enough." Criticizes the Sparkplug unsanctioned mission (Ch. 85) but cannot argue with results.

    Mandates first aid training for Sam during this period. At the joint hero meeting at DVD HQ (Ch. 85), notes the Kingdom is "operating on a need-to-know basis. Compartmentalizing information."

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Supporting

    During the summer, spends more time with the adult DVDs while continuing to lead the YD. Issues warnings about Jump/Fly side effects: increased aggression, psychosis, delusions of grandeur, and unpredictable secondary mutations as the formula becomes more dilute. Visits Sam with "well-timed words of wisdom" - Sam notes it is "weird to have him always show up exactly when he's needed."

    At the pivotal DVD meeting (Ch. 91), his and Puppeteer's faces "twitch in some sort of disappointment" when learning Patches has been transferred to Daedalus. He exchanges knowing looks with Rampart and Puppeteer regarding the upcoming graduation. Described as going into his second year of college, with an "imposing silhouette" and "solemn gaze." During the graduation discussion (Ch. 92), he has "brooding gravity" and notes "this changes things for the team in a fairly significant way." Refuses to lean one way or another on candidates, keeping his eyes closed - Sam wonders if he has seen the future but "refuses to give us anything about it." Emerged as the sole viable candidate after Gale stepped back and Puppeteer disclosed a psychological condition precluding registry beyond a LUMA.

    During the post-trial protest crisis (Ch. 97), refuses to take sides in the team's split over NSRA orders to suppress protesters - walks away into the courthouse with Spindle rather than confront civilians, but feeds tactical intelligence to Multiplex via earpiece, serving as a neutral broker. Reports through Multiplex's comms that "those lunatics force-fed the protestors Jump." At the makeshift command center debriefing (Ch. 99), Sam notes he has "always been able to see right through me, even without using his powers." He offers emotional support and references precognition obliquely.

    Warned Illya Fedorov against joining the courthouse battle during the Phreaks' attack, explaining that if Deathgirl copied his nuclear powers without a containment suit, she would kill everyone in Philadelphia. Showed Illya a gesture of trust by flipping a coin. Graduated to the Delaware Valley Defenders in the subsequent reorganization (Ch. 100), with Rampart appointed as his YD successor.

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Operates as a member of the Delaware Valley Defenders. Present at the full DVD headquarters meeting (Ch. 113) following Patriot's homecoming dance attack on Sam, flanking Multiplex alongside Fury Forge at the table with Councilman Davis, Bulwark, Captain Plasma, Clara Parker, and the remaining Young Defenders. Delivers a cynical assessment: "They'll sweep it all under the rug again. Like they always do." The team discusses the response and Sam announces her congressional testimony.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the full DVD meeting regarding the Kingdom's zoo heist plans (Ch. 125), coin-flipping with a distant look, speaking quietly but insightfully about "outcomes based on incomplete information." Suggests the operation may be a "prelude to a citywide attack." Explains Connor's absence from the meeting: "He's meeting with his potential new foster parents today" - the foster placement had been in the works for a while.

    During the zoo battle (Ch. 133-135), arrives as backup with Fury Forge on an ATV. Sustains a stab wound during the fighting and is pale and shaky afterward but alive. Walks over to Sam alongside Multiplex after the battle and delivers his analysis: "I would say that you can't keep running off alone, but it worked out this time. And I know that no matter what I tell you, you'll do it anyway." Points out that the Kingdom may have counted on someone discovering the rhinoceros diversion, allowing the smaller frog heist to proceed unnoticed while heroes focused on the spectacle.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Supporting

    When Sam is set on fire at school by Aaron McKinley, Crossroads visits the Small family home with Multiplex and Captain Plasma (Ch. 145). Described as having "sharp, detached intensity" and not saying much initially. Sam asks to speak with him privately and proposes a coin trick: "Heads, I'll tell you. Tails, I won't." The coin lands tails, but Crossroads says "You've told me as much as we need to know" - his power let him see the alternate future where she told him everything. Gets a nosebleed from overusing his powers. Sam says "Your power is such a fucking cheat, dude."

    After Kate Smith's house fire (Ch. 147), Sam calls Crossroads for backup. He responds "On it" with rapid keyboard clacking, but Sam hangs up before he can tell her to wait. Arrives with paramedics. When Sam demands he use his precognition to locate Aaron (Ch. 147), a heated confrontation erupts:

    - Sam: "Flip that stupid coin... Heads, he's in Tacony. Tails, he's in Mayfair. Keep going until you narrow it down to the fucking house!"
    - Crossroads: "You're asking me to use my powers to surveil someone without probable cause... The law still applies."
    - Sam slaps Crossroads.
    - Crossroads, with raw emotion breaking through his mask: "Of course I care. But caring doesn't give me the right to break the law."
    - He relents: "I'll do what I can. But if this backfires, it's on you."

    The binary search to locate Aaron (Ch. 148) has Sam precommitting to two streets per coin flip while Crossroads sees which timeline yields results. They eliminate clean streets one by one - Revere, Pine, Hawthorne, Unruh - until Magee shows "something happens here." Crossroads' nose is bleeding from overuse and his eyelid is twitching. The answer narrows to Vogt Park, ten minutes from Sam's house. Crossroads gives Sam a one-hour deadline and calls dispatch to send a cop car and paramedics. When Sam insists on going alone, Crossroads objects: "You're my friend. And my teammate, even if I graduated." Sam refuses: "I can heal. You can't." After Sam's brutal fight with Aaron, she limps toward the stairs saying "Crossroads will be here soon." He catches her before she collapses when she emerges from the building.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced indirectly through broader DVD operations.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Now a full DVD alongside Rampart (Ch. 169). Warns Sam about increased surveillance from both the NSRA and the Kingdom of Keys alongside Rampart during Sam's training sessions with Multiplex. Plays a critical role in the Phase Two operation to fake Soot's death. Called real police on a 15-minute delay as part of the deception timeline and used his precognition to coordinate the operation. After Mrs. Quiet shoots Sam three times and the team throws her into the Delaware River, Crossroads finds and recovers Sam at the Wissinoming Yacht Club dock approximately twenty minutes after she entered the water (Ch. 175). When Sam delivers a flash drive and a Hypeman autoinjector to DVD headquarters afterward, Multiplex has already learned the full details from Crossroads. Present at the farewell party at Music Hall where Jordan formally transfers Auditors leadership to Sam, and Connor arrives revealing he and Jordan never broke up (Ch. 177).

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Active with the DVDs during operations and intelligence sharing.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Supporting

    During the Shrike crisis, Crossroads' future vision cannot peek far enough ahead because each barbed-wire-wrapped booby trap takes too long to clear, exceeding his temporal horizon. Paired with Rampart checking Shrike locations in South Philly while Fury Forge and Bulwark handle West Philly and Multiplex watches for Shrike with multiple copies. Quotes Sam about saving one life equaling saving the world. Sam describes him as the most reliable person she knows and texts him as backup for the Opera House mission (Ch. 206).

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam asks Miasma to contact Crossroads at the DVDs "on the down low," calling him "my walking plan-unfucker." She then experiences sudden guilt about their relationship, wondering if they are just "mutual tools for each other." Referenced as part of the Delaware Valley Defenders' operations during the ongoing Shrike crisis. The mentorship program launched by Davis and Sam's transition to strategist/mentor role set the stage for Crossroads' later intelligence partnership with Sam during her fugitive period.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Major (Interlude MaM.1)

    Provides retrocausality-based target intelligence and timing windows for Sam's eleven days of systematic raids against Kingdom operations from rotating safehouses. Texts Sam target assessments in a "C:" format - quiet targets for evidence gathering, loud targets when Sam wants Maya to notice. Sends "Nice work." texts after operations. Sam sends gun photos from a Kingdom weapons warehouse directly to Crossroads: "I'll let it into the chain." Miasma analyzes Crossroads' power as creating "closed timelike curves in information space" - retrocausality rather than prediction, where information exists before the choice - but Crossroads insists it is "really good prediction."

    In Interlude MaM.1, while studying international metahuman law at his apartment late Sunday/early Monday (with a paper due Tuesday - DVD shift work does not care about academic deadlines), his precognition branches diverge. The reading branch cuts off at 47 seconds; someone is coming through the door in 43 seconds. He reaches for the kitchen counter and considers the knife block but rejects it as too lethal - "That's the line I won't cross." Mrs. Heartbeat enters in a maroon pantsuit with a suppressed pistol already drawn. No negotiation branch exists in any future he can see.

    The brutal fight leaves him with three gunshot wounds (hip graze, deltoid, shoulder) and multiple stab wounds. Mrs. Heartbeat uses second-order game theory, predicting his predictions and compensating for his compensation. She targets his mobility with thigh cuts from a butterfly knife, shoots his coin out of the air, and shoots his phone off the counter. Her palmless gloves become coated in his blood from small slits she makes to improve her grip. He manages to send Sam "ALERTA" plus Maya's Mayfair address via an emergency text macro on his phone mid-fight. He uses a 3-second precognitive overclock to disarm her knife, causing a nosebleed and blood from his eyes. Mrs. Heartbeat takes a liver hit from Maxwell - the smallest grunt, barely audible, the first sound she makes - and suffers 2-3 broken fingers but keeps fighting. She escapes through a window using a glass-breaking hammer as sirens approach; his only real-time word during the entire fight is "Mother fucker."

    Undergoes surgery at Jefferson University Hospital where a bullet is removed and wounds are cleaned and sutured. Wakes at 6 AM and insists on leaving immediately, knowing the hospital is not safe from a follow-up assassination attempt. Identifies himself as "Maxwell Martinez. Delaware Valley Defenders. ID in my wallet" - his DVD credentials carry weight with the cops. Arrives at the Small family home, where he reveals his real name to the family and calls Sam his sister "in a matter of speaking." Sam checks his shoulder bandage and notes the doctors did clean work. Recovers on the couch while continuing to provide intelligence, mapping Kingdom systematic territorial expansion using a GIS model and identifying the grid pattern spreading from Frankford/Cottman along commercial corridors. Ben Small helps correct his expansion model from radial to infrastructure-based spread (commercial corridors, bus routes, foot traffic).

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Recovering from injuries at the Small family home. Refuses Sam's bed and takes the couch, testing cushions with his good arm. Already awake early Tuesday morning with his laptop open, speaking Spanish on phone. Maintains a spreadsheet tracking times and locations on his laptop and monitors the police scanner for upticks in calls, noise complaints, and suspicious persons reports. Warns Sam: "Be careful. You're always extremely good at improvising and you have a good tactical head. That does not mean you're careful." Alert when the power goes out during Maya's blizzard - "I noticed." Not sleeping. Cross-references break-in reports with the territory map, confirming all 16 break-ins fall inside the mapped grid during the 1-4 AM outage window. Declares: "This wasn't just a crime spree. This was a demonstration." Checks Maya's public schedule and discovers she had an alibi at a Center City fundraiser with photos and witnesses, meaning Alice wore Maya's face at the fundraiser while the real Maya manipulated weather from elsewhere. Flips half-dollars for Sam before she goes out: "Nothing I can see. Be careful anyway."

    Gets Sam ice when she comes home with cracked ribs from a Songbird bounty attack without pressing for details. Points out the attack symbol might be a letter J, and that the attackers are not targeting Bloodhound - they are targeting Sam Small. Quotes "No Country for Old Men": "If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?" This triggers Sam's emotional breakdown and realization about her retirement not working.

    Coordinates DVD operations from upstairs during Sam's mentorship meetings, serving as a second brain for dispatch while still recovering. Participates in the war room sessions in the Smalls' dining room with his laptop running the GIS map. Tasha catches him off guard with a joke - "Are you saying that because I'm black?" - and the whole room cracks up. Offers to drive Alex Kirby home one-armed after a late planning session.

    Provides his final coin-flip assist in the community center Faraday room to help Sam prepare for the call to Agent Ford, using precognition to determine: "Lead with the public health data" because the FBI agent thinks in national security terms. Creates a flowchart of conversation branches, most of which converge on Ford taking the intel. Advises half-truths over full lies for sourcing questions. Listens in during the call itself.

    Shoulder reaches 80-85% mobility. Departs the Small home on a Sunday morning after approximately three months on the couch, planning to finish physical therapy from his dorm. Dad hugs him on the way out. Final words to Sam: "You built something good, Sam. Let it work."


## Trivia

- Carries half-dollars at all times for his precognitive coin flips.
- Drives a rusty '90s sedan with paint like autumn leaves, sagging seats, burn holes in the upholstery, and a smell of old cigarettes - a family car that predates him.
- Sam describes him as "the most reliable person I know" and "my walking plan-unfucker."
- "ALERTA" is the emergency bug-out code word between Sam and Crossroads, set up as a text macro on his phone that simultaneously sends the word and copies the address he was surveilling.
- Echoes Puppeteer's phrase "Woman plans, God laughs" with his own version: "Man plans, God laughs."
- Has read the manga BLAME! - he recognized Jordan's Killy costume at the Halloween party.
