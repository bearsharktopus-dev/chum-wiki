## Background

Maxwell Martinez applied for a JLUMA (Juvenile Licensed Use of Metahuman Abilities) in 2020, presenting a unique cognitive ability to predict discrete outcomes of inflection points. His initial attempts at independent heroism resulted in more than a few injuries, but these early setbacks helped him develop a more realistic understanding of his capabilities. After receiving his juvenile license, he joined the Young Defenders and quickly proved himself a valuable team member thanks to his strategic thinking and predictive powers.

When Puppeteer was admitted for inpatient psychiatric treatment in 2023, Maxwell stepped into the role of acting leader of the Young Defenders. He demonstrated strong leadership during this period, recruiting Sam Small and Jordan Westwood for an undercover mission at the Crescent nightclub to gather intelligence on the Kingdom of Keys. His tenure as acting leader was noted positively by his PERKS interviewing officer, who predicted he would be tapped for a formal leadership role following Puppeteer's graduation.

Maxwell graduated from the Young Defenders to the adult Delaware Valley Defenders roster after a period of team restructuring prompted by Councilman Jamal Davis. He continued to serve as a tactical coordinator and dispatcher for the team. In late 2025, while providing intelligence support for Sam Small's operations against the Kingdom of Keys, Maxwell was attacked at his apartment by Mrs. Heartbeat, a Kingdom assassin. He survived the brutal assault -- which left him with multiple gunshot wounds and stab wounds -- only through the use of his precognitive abilities, managing to send Sam a warning text before his phone was destroyed. He subsequently relocated to the Small family home to recover, as it was considered the most heavily surveilled location in Philadelphia.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | B6/S/M/V |
| **Category** | Brain |
| **Power Ranking** | N/A (narrative description only; no numerical score provided) |
| **Control** | 8/10 |
| **Hostility** | 1/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 0/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 3/10 |

### Abilities

- **Discrete Outcome Prediction** - Perceives and predicts outcomes of inflection points where a decision or action results in a limited set of discrete outcomes. Works best with binary choices (e.g., coin flips) and remains effective up to six possible outcomes. Beyond six, predictions become unreliable.
- **Accelerated Perception** - Perceives future events at a rate approximately 201.67 times faster than normal. A few seconds of concentration can yield insights into outcomes occurring minutes to hours ahead.
- **Multi-Sensory Visions** - Predictions are experienced in the mind's eye but encompass all senses, providing a comprehensive perception of potential outcomes. He can function normally while experiencing future visions, though this was difficult when his powers first manifested.
- **Precommitment Exploitation** - Uses information theory and precommitment strategies to extract maximum value from his predictions. Carries coins at all times to flip, reading the outcomes from both sides simultaneously to decide on future actions. This technique effectively doubles the information gained from each use of his power.
- **Overclocking** - Can push his abilities into a continuous future-vision state approximately two to three seconds ahead of real time. This grants significant combat advantages, allowing him to anticipate and react to attacks before they occur. Whether this is a specialized form of his primary power or a secondary ability remains undetermined.

### Limitations

- **Temporal Clarity Degradation** - Predictions are most accurate and detailed within the first 15 minutes of future sight. Clarity decreases sharply beyond this point, becoming vague after 30 minutes and entirely incomprehensible after 2 hours of perceived time.
- **Discrete Outcome Cap** - Accuracy is highest with binary choices and decreases as the number of potential outcomes increases, becoming unreliable beyond six discrete possibilities.
- **Overclocking Strain** - Using the overclocked ability causes significant physical strain, typically resulting in nosebleeds or eye bleeds due to a manifestation of the bracing effect. Extended use risks internal hemorrhage.
- **Mental Concentration** - The ability requires significant concentration, with effectiveness reduced in high-stress or distracting environments.
- **Non-Interactive Visions** - Visions are strictly observational. He cannot interact with or alter events within his visions, though he can change his current plans based on what he foresees.

### Training & Skills

- Trained in tactical planning, field leadership, and mission coordination through years of service with the Young Defenders and Delaware Valley Defenders.
- Strong background in information theory, which he applies intuitively to maximize the effectiveness of his predictive abilities.
- Athletic and physically capable, though not a primary combatant.
- Currently attending college, likely at the University of Pennsylvania.

## Personality

Maxwell is extremely quiet, thoughtful, and responsible, carrying himself with a soft-spoken politeness that some find slightly eerie. He is extraordinarily decisive despite being a precognitive -- a contradiction of the typical "indecisive seer" archetype. He uses his powers to navigate social encounters, gathering information from branches of conversation that never actually occur, though he will voluntarily stop doing so if it makes someone uncomfortable. He self-imposes strict personal limits on the use of his abilities out of a strong sense of honor and ethics.

He is deeply religious as a Catholic, though he does not discuss his faith in professional contexts. Maxwell struggles privately with the increasing demands to use his power for official purposes but keeps this tension to himself. He is a steadfast ally who places great trust in those he believes in, particularly Sam Small, and is always willing to back her judgment even when it conflicts with established protocol. His character flaws are subtle and difficult to identify without extended close contact.

In Interlude MaM.1, while studying metahuman law and coin-flipping at his apartment late Sunday/early Monday, his precognition branches diverge -- one timeline cuts off at 47 seconds, indicating an assassination attempt. Mrs. Heartbeat enters with a suppressed pistol; no negotiation branch exists. The brutal fight leaves him with three gunshot wounds (hip graze, deltoid, shoulder), multiple stab wounds, and he texts Sam "ALERTA" plus Maya's Mayfair address mid-fight before Mrs. Heartbeat destroys his phone. She predicts his predictions using second-order game theory. He uses a 3-second precognitive overclock to disarm her knife, causing a nosebleed from the bracing effect.
