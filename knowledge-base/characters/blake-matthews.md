## Background

Blake Alexander Matthews was born in Trenton, New Jersey, the only child of Sarah Matthews (librarian) and Peter Matthews (warehouse supervisor). He graduated from Trenton Central High School in 2007 and worked a series of physically demanding jobs - gym assistant, landscaping, construction, and bar security - obtaining basic first aid and CPR certifications but not pursuing higher education beyond trade school.

His metahuman ability manifested before his entry into the criminal world. Early attempts to integrate his powers into legitimate work (personal trainer, private security, construction consultant) all failed due to difficulties controlling his transformation. Between 2016 and 2022, he worked as an enforcer for various criminal organizations under the alias Rex Rampage. His recruitment into the Kingdom of Keys came through the underground fighting circuit, where his sportsmanship and personal code caught the attention of an opponent called Sledgehammer, who connected him with Mr. Bomb (BM.3 flashback). Within the Kingdom, he assumed the codename Mr. Tyrannosaur and rose to become the Philadelphia branch's primary intimidator and leg breaker.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Tyrannosaurus Rex Transformation** - Blake can transform into a biologically accurate, anatomically complete Tyrannosaurus rex. The dinosaur form includes downy feathers, lip structures, near-vestigial arms, and a significant layer of body fat, reflecting current paleontological understanding. Notably, Blake's transformed form displayed these scientifically accurate features before they became widely known to the public, indicating the transformation produces a genuine specimen rather than one shaped by Blake's perception.
- **Transformation Process** - The transformation takes approximately five seconds, during which Blake emits a burst of superheated steam hypothesized to be a byproduct of the rapid mass shift. Clothing and personal effects are temporarily stored in an extradimensional space during the transformation, reappearing when he reverts. Blake is not vulnerable during the transformation window.
- **Dinosaur-Form Physical Capabilities** - In Tyrannosaurus form, Blake possesses all the natural abilities of the species: immense strength sufficient to demolish buildings, the ability to bite through metal and substantial structures, high top speed, and natural armor from the dinosaur's physiology. No special powers are required because physics does the rest of the work for a complete Tyrannosaurus rex.
- **Cognitive Continuity** - Blake retains his full human intelligence while transformed, making his dinosaur form significantly more dangerous than a feral animal. He cannot communicate verbally in this form.

### Limitations

- **Tissue Dissolution** - Body parts separated from Blake's Tyrannosaurus form, such as knocked-out teeth, rapidly decompose outside his body, turning red, then ashy, then dissolving into sludge before washing away entirely. This parallels a similar property observed in Sam Small's shed teeth.
- **Injury Scaling** - Injuries are proportionally scaled between his human and Tyrannosaurus forms. A minor injury in human form can become significant in Tyrannosaurus form, and vice versa.
- **Transformation Fatigue** - Repeated transformations in quick succession are physically draining, though he can perform them frequently if needed.
- **No Verbal Communication** - Blake cannot speak while in Tyrannosaurus form.
- **Collateral Damage** - The sheer size and power of his dinosaur form makes precision difficult, leading to extensive property damage in most engagements.

### Training & Skills

- Exceptionally gifted brawler capable of fighting most people to a standstill without powers. Described as dangerously clever in combat; would be exceptionally dangerous with formal martial arts training.
- Actively researches Tyrannosaurus rex biology to stay combat effective, though he requires Dr. Trinh-Norwood to translate technical material.
- Experienced in demolition and heavy machinery operation from his construction background.

## Personality

Blake is thuggish and not book smart, but dangerously clever in a fight and tactically intelligent in ways people consistently underestimate. He reacts poorly to being demeaned or disrespected. He views his criminal work as simply a different market from most jobs, approaching it with blue-collar pragmatism, and enjoys women, booze, and cigarettes in classic mobster fashion.

He actively dislikes the nickname "Mr. T-Rex," considering it childish, and prefers his proper codename. He is not particularly fond of dinosaurs in a general sense - a notable irony given his powers - but studies T. rex biology out of practical necessity. His anonymous presence on paleontology forums as "Rexanon" was easily identified due to poor spelling and a singleminded focus on speculative T. rex biology. He possesses a personal code of conduct (refusing to finish downed opponents) and shows capacity for private doubt about the Kingdom's more dangerous operations.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First appears at the Crescent nightclub VIP section alongside Dr. Xenograft and Mrs. Heartbeat, where Sam and Jordan identify him as a Kingdom figure. Later attacks Sam's family home in Mayfair alongside Mrs. Z, transforming into a Tyrannosaurus rex and systematically destroying the house. Fought by Bulwark, who injures him and forces his retreat.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Interlude (AMK.1)

    Appears alongside Mr. Polygraph in Interlude AMK.1 to intimidate Aaron McKinley over lost Kingdom money. Tyrannosaur physically restrains Aaron while Polygraph threatens him with yubitsume (finger removal) and ultimately assigns Aaron to kill Bloodhound as his chance at redemption.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Interlude (BM.1)

    POV interlude set at Kingdom headquarters in South Philadelphia, disguised as an accounting firm with a professional reception area, large fish tank, and a break room featuring luxurious amenities including a chandelier. Blake observes the Kingdom hierarchy and social dynamics, noting how news about superheroes on the break room television triggers resentment among members. Participates in a leadership discussion about the emerging Fly drug crisis when Mr. Polygraph arrives visibly injured from an encounter with Fly-powered "gutter punks." Blake suggests they find the Fly recipe and manufacture it themselves, while Mrs. Zenith favors identifying the distributors first and then deciding whether to eliminate or recruit them. The interlude ends with Mr. Polygraph inviting Blake to unwind at a strip club, departing together in a Cadillac.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Serves as the Kingdom's primary distraction during the Philadelphia Zoo heist (Operation Ivory), appearing in dinosaur form with a dinosaur-sized blanket cloak to destroy the rhino enclosure and draw hero attention while the real theft of poison dart frogs occurs elsewhere. Fights Captain Plasma, who hits him at supersonic speed. Escapes by trading six Jump-powered lackeys as a diversion and knocking out Captain Plasma, while Mr. Nothing and Mudslide are captured in the aftermath.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Interlude (BM.2)

    POV interlude following the Kingdom's ambush of a prison transport convoy on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Fights Captain Plasma while wearing crude kevlar plates; hit by Cryptid's anti-materiel round. Uses steam breath for cover and reverts to human form to escape. The cross-branch team retreats in a disguised plumbing van to a Kingdom-owned steakhouse in Lancaster (a money laundering front). At the steakhouse, team dynamics emerge: Jellyjam reveals her codename comes from the Goosebumps books, Yellowjacket describes meeting Upper Management ("intense," required gloves, low volume, double hand sanitizer), and Doppelganger is revealed as the rogue SWAT agent from the convoy operation.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Interlude (BM.3)

    POV interlude at a Kingdom planning meeting at Bella Notte restaurant in Staten Island. Mr. Antithesis presents the Daedalus prison break operation contracted by Red Calf's Porcelain - $2 million per surviving operator, scheduled for September 10th. Blake is designated "contingency response" (drop a T-rex on it). He questions the timing, noting the Harrisburg-to-Daedalus distance makes the supposed distraction implausible. Xenograft identifies a missing corridor in the blueprints; Antithesis reveals Porcelain is "not concerned about collateral escapes." Blake and Mrs. Quiet privately agree the operation "smells wrong." Includes a flashback to his Rex Rampage underground fighting days and Sledgehammer's recruitment referral.


## Trivia

- His Professional Asset Dossier was prepared by Mr. E and Mr. C of the Kingdom of Keys, recommending him for the "Mr./Mrs. T" position. The dossier was embedded with an explosive tracker by Mr. B, set to detonate if moved to unauthorized locations.
- The destruction of Sam Small's home in Mayfair is one of the most consequential Kingdom actions in the story, forcing Sam to relocate to Lily Chen's rowhome in Bridesburg.
- Criminal record includes arrests for disorderly conduct (2010), property damage (2012), illegal underground fighting (2014), assault and battery (2017), trespassing and vandalism (2019), and a public disturbance in Tyrannosaurus form (2021).
- One of the more socially connected Kingdom operatives - gets along well with both Polygraph (departing for a strip club together in BM.1) and Mudslide.
