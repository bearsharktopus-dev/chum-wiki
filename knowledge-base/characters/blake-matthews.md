## Background

Blake Alexander Matthews was born in Trenton, New Jersey, the only child of Sarah Matthews, a local librarian, and Peter Matthews, a warehouse supervisor. He graduated from Trenton Central High School in 2007 and entered the workforce through a series of physically demanding jobs: gym assistant, freelance landscaping and construction, and security work at local bars and clubs. He obtained certifications in basic first aid, CPR, and attended various self-defense workshops, but did not pursue higher education beyond trade school.

Blake's metahuman ability to transform into a Tyrannosaurus rex manifested at some point before his entry into the criminal world. His early attempts to integrate his powers into legitimate work met with limited success. Stints as a personal trainer, private security contractor, and construction consultant all ended due to difficulties controlling his transformation and adhering to conventional workplace expectations. Between 2016 and 2022, he worked as an enforcer for various criminal organizations under the alias Rex Rampage, gaining experience in underworld dealings through straightforward, forceful methods.

Blake's recruitment into the Kingdom of Keys came through the underground fighting circuit. While fighting as Rex Rampage, he deliberately fought without using his dinosaur transformation, relying instead on raw technique and perseverance. After one such fight against a larger opponent called Sledgehammer, his sportsmanship and personal code caught attention. Sledgehammer offered him a security job and connected him to Mr. Bomb, leading to Blake's entry into the Kingdom organization around 2019. Within the Kingdom, he assumed the codename Mr. Tyrannosaur and rose to become the primary intimidator and in-house leg breaker for the Philadelphia branch.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Tyrannosaurus Rex Transformation** - Blake can transform into a biologically accurate, anatomically complete Tyrannosaurus rex. The dinosaur form includes downy feathers, lip structures, near-vestigial arms, and a significant layer of body fat, reflecting current paleontological understanding. Notably, Blake's transformed form displayed these scientifically accurate features before they became widely known to the public, indicating the transformation produces a genuine specimen rather than one shaped by Blake's perception.
- **Transformation Process** - The transformation takes approximately five seconds, during which Blake emits a burst of superheated steam hypothesized to be a byproduct of the rapid mass shift. Clothing and personal effects are temporarily stored in an extradimensional space during the transformation, reappearing when he reverts. Blake is not vulnerable during the transformation window.
- **Dinosaur-Form Physical Capabilities** - In Tyrannosaurus form, Blake possesses all the natural abilities of the species: immense strength sufficient to demolish buildings, the ability to bite through metal and substantial structures, high top speed, and natural armor from the dinosaur's physiology. No special powers are required because physics does the rest of the work for a complete Tyrannosaurus rex.
- **Cognitive Continuity** - Blake retains his full human intelligence while transformed, making his dinosaur form significantly more dangerous than a feral animal. He cannot communicate verbally in this form.

### Limitations

- **Injury Scaling** - Injuries are proportionally scaled between his human and Tyrannosaurus forms. A minor injury in human form can become significant in Tyrannosaurus form, and vice versa.
- **Transformation Fatigue** - Repeated transformations in quick succession are physically draining, though he can perform them frequently if needed.
- **No Verbal Communication** - Blake cannot speak while in Tyrannosaurus form.
- **Collateral Damage** - The sheer size and power of his dinosaur form makes precision difficult, leading to extensive property damage in most engagements.

### Training & Skills

- Exceptionally gifted brawler capable of fighting most people to a standstill without using his powers, including superhumans. He is described as dangerously clever in combat and would be exceptionally dangerous with formal martial arts training.
- Basic hand-to-hand combat training honed through participation in underground fighting circuits and various security and enforcement roles.
- Actively researches Tyrannosaurus rex biology and keeps up with the latest paleontological literature to stay combat effective and learn new techniques for his dinosaur form, though he requires Dr. Trinh-Norwood to translate the more technical material.
- Certified in basic first aid and CPR.
- Completed trade school.
- Experienced in demolition and heavy machinery operation from his construction background.

## Personality

Blake is thuggish and not book smart, but dangerously clever in a fight and tactically intelligent in ways that people consistently underestimate. He reacts poorly to being demeaned, minimized, or disrespected, displaying bursts of anger or frustration in such situations. He views his criminal work as simply a different market from most jobs, approaching it with a blue-collar pragmatism. He enjoys women, booze, and cigarettes in a classic mobster fashion and gets along particularly well with his colleague Mr. Mudslide. He previously struggled with self-image, likely related to the drastic nature of his powers and the challenges they imposed on his ability to live a conventional life.

Blake is not particularly fond of dinosaurs in a general sense, a notable irony given his powers. People in his world do not choose their abilities. However, he studies Tyrannosaurus rex biology extensively out of practical necessity, using the latest scientific literature to improve his combat effectiveness. His online presence includes anonymous participation in paleontology forums, where he was easily identified as "Rexanon" due to poor spelling and a singleminded focus on speculative questions about Tyrannosaurus rex biology. He possesses a personal code of conduct, as demonstrated by his refusal to finish a downed opponent in the underground fighting circuit, and he shows the capacity for private doubt about the Kingdom's more dangerous operations.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Interlude (BM.1)

    POV interlude set at Kingdom headquarters in South Philadelphia, disguised as an accounting firm with a professional reception area, large fish tank, and a break room featuring luxurious amenities including a chandelier. Blake observes the Kingdom hierarchy and social dynamics, noting how news about superheroes on the break room television triggers resentment among members. Participates in a leadership discussion about the emerging Fly drug crisis when Mr. Polygraph arrives visibly injured from an encounter with Fly-powered "gutter punks." Blake suggests they either eliminate or recruit the Fly distributors. The interlude ends with Mr. Polygraph inviting Blake to unwind at a strip club, departing together in a Cadillac.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Serves as the Kingdom's primary distraction during the Philadelphia Zoo heist (Operation Ivory), appearing in dinosaur form to destroy the rhino enclosure and draw hero attention while the real theft of poison dart frogs occurs elsewhere. Fights Captain Plasma, who hits him at supersonic speed. Escapes with some followers despite the heroes' partial victory.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Interlude (BM.2)

    POV interlude following the Kingdom's ambush of a prison transport convoy on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Fights Captain Plasma on the highway, escapes via steam transformation after being hit by an anti-materiel round. The team retreats in a disguised plumbing van branded "Ace Flow Solutions" to a Kingdom-owned steakhouse in Lancaster, a money laundering front. During the van ride, the team mocks Mudslide's paper bag mask and its working-class symbolism, while Mrs. Jellyjam (revealed as the "Pink Suit" operative from the prison intervention) announces the Lancaster stop per Upper Management orders. At the steakhouse, team dynamics emerge through banter: Jellyjam reveals her name comes from the Goosebumps books, Yellowjacket describes Upper Management as "Quiet. Intense. Lots of hand sanitizer," and Mr. Nothing remains notably quiet throughout. Mrs. Doppelganger is revealed to have been the seemingly rogue SWAT agent during the prison transport operation. Blake reveals a pragmatic but wounded perspective.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Interlude (BM.3)

    POV interlude at a Kingdom planning meeting at Bella Notte restaurant in Staten Island. Mr. Antithesis joins via video call -- highly unusual, as he has never before shown his face so casually -- and presents the Daedalus prison break operation contracted by Red Calf's Porcelain. Payment is set at $2 million per surviving operator, scheduled for September 10th during state senate hearings. Blake is designated as "contingency response" (drop a T-rex on it). He questions the timing, noting the distance between Harrisburg and Daedalus makes the distraction implausible. Mrs. Xenograft identifies a missing corridor in the blueprints, and when questioned about potential collateral escapes, Mr. Antithesis reveals Porcelain is "not concerned about collateral escapes." Blake speaks privately with Mrs. Quiet afterward; both agree the operation "smells wrong," with Quiet questioning why Red Calf would involve the Kingdom rather than handling the extraction themselves. Includes a flashback to Blake's underground fighting career as Rex Rampage against Sledgehammer, showing his personal code (refusing to finish a downed opponent) and his recruitment path into the Kingdom through Mr. Bomb.


## Trivia

- Blake's Professional Asset Dossier was prepared by Mr. E and Mr. C of the Kingdom of Keys as a recruitment evaluation, recommending him for the "Mr./Mrs. T" position, with the suggestion of "Mr. Tyrannosaurus" as a codename.
- The dossier notes that his dinosaur form displayed scientifically accurate features such as downy feathers and lip structures before these became widely accepted in paleontology, suggesting his transformation produces a genuine biological specimen.
- His online alias "Rexanon" was easily identified on paleontology forums due to his poor spelling and singular fixation on Tyrannosaurus rex speculative biology.
- The destruction of Sam Small's home in Mayfair is one of the most consequential Kingdom actions in the story, forcing Sam to relocate to Lily Chen's family rowhome in Bridesburg and serving as a repeated reference point for the Kingdom's threat level.
- His criminal record includes arrests for disorderly conduct (2010), property damage (2012), illegal underground fighting (2014), assault and battery (2017), trespassing and vandalism (2019), and a public disturbance in Tyrannosaurus form (2021).
- The recruitment dossier was embedded with an explosive tracker by Mr. B, set to detonate if moved to unauthorized locations or by unauthorized individuals.
- In BM.1, Blake reflects on how ordinary people end up as part of a criminal enterprise, observing the contrast between the Kingdom HQ's luxurious break room and the reality of its operations.
- Blake's social rapport with Mr. Polygraph is demonstrated in both BM.1 (departing for a strip club together in a Cadillac) and his broader partnership with Mudslide, marking him as one of the more socially connected operatives in the Philadelphia branch.
- During BM.2, the team orders steaks at the Lancaster safehouse, with Blake and each operative revealing personality through their preferences.
- Blake's questioning of the Daedalus operation's logic in BM.3 -- specifically noting that the distance between the senate hearings in Harrisburg and the prison in northern New York makes the supposed distraction implausible -- demonstrates his tactical intelligence despite his lack of formal education.
