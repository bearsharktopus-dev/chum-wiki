## Background

Kaitlyn "Kate" Smith grew up in the Mayfair neighborhood of Philadelphia, the daughter of Liam Smith, a single father who struggled with a gambling addiction and financial difficulties. Kate was a talented basketball player and one of Sam Small's closest childhood friends, part of a tight-knit group that included Marcus Johnson, Lilly Rodriguez, Tasha Reynolds, and Jenna Nguyen. She attended Abraham Lincoln High School, where she excelled on the basketball team and was known for her competitive athleticism and blunt personality.

Kate's metahuman abilities manifested during the events of Arc 9 ("Sheol"), when Aaron McKinley set fire to her family's house in Mayfair in February 2025. Kate was trapped upstairs and nearly died before Sam rescued her. The near-death experience triggered her gas absorption powers. The circumstances of the fire were ambiguous, as Kate was found with cuts along her arms that may have been self-inflicted, and she later described having visions of fire and smoke during her clinical death that led her to believe she was condemned to hell.

Following her recovery, Kate secretly became the vigilante Miss Mayfly, assembling Team Mayfly from her civilian friends to patrol Northeast Philadelphia, which she identified as being ignored by major superheroes as a place where "quiet" crime "festers unchallenged." The team consisted of Mite (tech expert controlling drones), Ant (tactical leader and programmer), Moth (medical support and chemistry), and Wasp (reconnaissance and emergency services communication). Kate changed into her gear in an alley behind "Tom's," her father's favorite pub, equipping herself with a taser glove, pepper spray dispenser, goggles, and mini-drones. The team's headquarters was Kate's own bedroom. During their first documented operation, they targeted a credit union robbery by criminals wearing knock-off superhero masks (Peregrine, Captain Steel, Railgun, Lady Justice), deploying military-grade stink bombs via drones within a coordinated 60-second operational window while Wasp called police. Kate suffered a crowbar strike to the ribs during the engagement, later assessed as "just a sprain with impressive bruising" by Moth. In a subsequent operation (MM.2), Team Mayfly conducted multi-day rotating surveillance of Sam and Jordan, identified the Dobson Mills warehouse in East Falls as a center of investigation, and expanded their drone fleet to 16 units (4 parent drones with 3 "child" drones each) equipped with LIDAR sensors and coordinated flight patterns. Moth developed paint bombs as distraction devices and studied warehouse blueprints with Wasp, identifying a skylight as a key entry point. The team deployed around the warehouse at sunset with Wasp and Moth on the roof, Mite and Ant in a "Mobile Control Unit," and Kate on the ground. Their intervention during the Dobson Mills operation was not random but a calculated attempt to assist Sam's team, though Kate's protective instinct and misjudgment of Sam's abilities created complications. When her identity was revealed during the warehouse battle in Arc 5, Kate's resentment over class differences and feelings of abandonment by Sam erupted into a physical confrontation in which she took the power-enhancing drug Jump to fight Sam on equal terms. Their friendship fractured but slowly began to rebuild during the recovery period of Arc 9 when Kate moved in with the Small family after the house fire. Kate later adopted the identity Soot, operating as a solo vigilante using chemical smoke powers against Jump drug dealers. As Soot, she demonstrated a calculated and methodical approach: infiltrating dealer gatherings, negotiating trades of drugs for Jump, and using carbon monoxide gas to incapacitate targets when situations escalated. She acquired Jump pills, money, and other drugs during operations, and maintained a warehouse base where she processed chemicals to replenish her powers and treated her own injuries. Her stated motivation was to help her father. When Bloodhound (Sam) tracked Soot to her warehouse and confronted her about her methods and morality, the debate over justice versus survival ended with Soot voluntarily surrendering her acquired Jump pills to Sam. After the Kingdom of Keys began hunting Soot, Sam orchestrated an elaborate plan to fake Soot's death. In a staged confrontation on Linden Avenue, Sam disguised as Soot fled from a fabricated villain team called "The Washes" -- Brainwash (Amelia/Gossamer), Powerwash (Lily/Blink), and Mouthwash (the real Kate in disguise) -- to Lardner's Point Park. Kingdom operatives Mr. Retribution, Mrs. Quiet, Mr. Polygraph, and Mr. Nothing arrived and offered the Washes $2,000 to interrogate "Soot" first. Kate (as Mouthwash) struck Sam with a metal rail to maintain the deception. Sam provided carefully crafted answers mixing truth and deception under interrogation, naming "Jackpot" as her handler and providing a false safehouse location. When Mr. Polygraph demanded to see Soot's face -- threatening to expose the deception -- a police siren (likely triggered by the team) created chaos, and Mrs. Quiet shot Sam multiple times with a silenced weapon. The Washes threw the severely injured Sam into the Delaware River, and Sam injected herself with a Hypeman autoinjector to survive. Kate relocated to Center City under the name Kay Smith, where she now works legitimate remediation jobs while her father recovers from his gambling addiction.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Gas/Aerosol Absorption** - Can absorb any type of gas, smoke, or aerosol into her body through her skin. This includes toxic substances such as mold spores, mycotoxins, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, chlorine gas, pepper spray, and chemical byproducts. She can store absorbed gases internally without apparent harm to herself.
- **Gas Deployment** - Can release previously absorbed gases through her skin at will, deploying them in controlled bursts or sustained clouds. Uses this offensively for area denial, smoke screens, and targeted chemical attacks. Can release different absorbed substances selectively.
- **Chemical Smoke Manipulation** - Primarily uses her power to absorb and redeploy smoke and chemical compounds, creating obscuring clouds, deploying pepper spray-laced smoke, or releasing noxious gases to incapacitate targets. As Soot, she used carbon monoxide gas offensively to incapacitate drug dealers during operations.
- **Toxic Processing** - Can process harmful airborne substances at extraordinary rates. During remediation work, she processed black mold concentrations at eleven times the expected level, clearing jobs in six hours that would normally take three days.

### Limitations

- **Physical Toll** - Processing large volumes of toxic substances takes a physical toll on her body, even though the gases themselves do not technically harm her.
- **No Inherent Combat Powers** - Her abilities are utility-based rather than directly offensive. She relies on martial arts training and chemical knowledge to make her powers dangerous in combat.
- **Recognition Risk** - As a supposedly dead vigilante, any use of her powers in public risks exposing her new identity.

### Training & Skills

- Exceptional basketball player, formerly starring at Abraham Lincoln High School, with the athleticism, speed, and competitive drive that carried over into her vigilante work.
- Extensively trained in multiple martial arts styles, demonstrating precise, economical movements in combat. Capable of fighting experienced metahumans using technique and tactics rather than brute force.
- Amateur chemist who systematically catalogs the absorption and deployment properties of various household chemicals, maintaining a detailed spreadsheet (columns: Compound, Vapor Properties, Absorption Feel, Deployment Effect) of substances available at any CVS. Tested compounds include isopropyl alcohol (flammable vapor, rapid dispersion, brief ignition), ammonia (effective area denial, obvious chemical presence), heavy vapors (sink fast, good for ground-level cover), and theatrical fog juice (glycerin/water mixture producing thick, non-alarming, sustained obscurement). Maintains plausible deniability since all chemicals appear as normal household items.
- Tactical planning and team coordination experience from leading Team Mayfly, including surveillance operations, drone deployment, and multi-team coordination.
- Proficient with non-lethal weapons including tasers, pepper spray (wrist-mounted canisters), and gas masks.
- Licensed juvenile metahuman contractor for hazardous material remediation work.

## Personality

Kate is intensely Catholic, carrying deep religious guilt that colors her worldview and self-perception. She believes herself damned to hell based on visions she experienced during her near-death event, and she attends weekly confession at St. Augustine's church without disclosing what she considers her real sins. She harbors romantic and sexual feelings for Sam that she has confessed but does not act on, and the intersection of her Catholic faith with these feelings compounds her guilt and self-esteem issues. She is snarky, precise, methodical, and morally absolutist, holding rigid views about right and wrong even as she struggles with her own perceived moral failures.

Beneath the sharp exterior, Kate grapples with class resentment, feelings of abandonment, and an addictive need for action and danger that mirrors Sam's own compulsions. She acknowledges having "the same poison Sam does" -- addiction to action and combat. As Soot, she held complex views on morality and justice, maintaining a strict moral code despite illegal activities and demonstrating personal history and philosophical tension with Bloodhound about methods versus morality, justice versus survival. She has described her legitimate post-Soot life as merely "tolerable" and continues to seek out dangerous situations through underground metahuman fight clubs, covert power experimentation, and fantasies of returning to vigilante work. She dreams about mixing chemicals, pulling her gas mask over her face, and hunting Kingdom dealers. Her weekly confessions at St. Augustine's church omit what she considers her real sins: "I let someone else take bullets for me. I abandoned my mission. I ran away." Her father's encouragement -- "You saved us. You don't have to keep saving us. Save a little of yourself too" -- falls on deaf ears; Kate's philosophy is that someone who has been to hell does not get to save herself but can only try to make it mean something. She feels more at home in the fight club than anywhere since leaving Tacony.
