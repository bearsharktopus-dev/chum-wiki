## Background

Kaitlyn "Kate" Smith grew up in the Mayfair neighborhood of Philadelphia, the daughter of Liam Smith, a single father who struggled with gambling addiction and financial difficulties. Kate was a talented basketball player and one of Sam Small's closest childhood friends, part of a tight-knit group that included Marcus Johnson, Lilly Rodriguez, Tasha Reynolds, and Jenna Nguyen. She attended Abraham Lincoln High School, excelling on the basketball team and known for her competitive athleticism and blunt personality.

While Sam was hospitalized after the Chernobyl crisis, Kate secretly became the vigilante Miss Mayfly, assembling Team Mayfly from her civilian friends to patrol Northeast Philadelphia. When her identity was revealed during the Dobson Mills warehouse battle (Arc 5), Kate's resentment over class differences and feelings of abandonment erupted into a physical confrontation with Sam. Their friendship fractured. Kate's house in Mayfair was later destroyed in a fire (Arc 9) - Aaron McKinley is the primary suspect, but the fire's origin is ambiguous. Kate was clinically dead for three minutes and forty-two seconds before being resuscitated, and the near-death experience triggered her gas absorption powers. She experienced visions of fire and burning that she interpreted as seeing hell, compounding her guilt over her identity as a lesbian.

After recovering with the Small family, Kate adopted the identity Soot, operating as a solo vigilante using her chemical smoke powers against Jump drug dealers. Her Soot operations caused approximately $80 million in damages to Kingdom of Keys operations, prompting them to deploy assassins to hunt her down. Sam orchestrated an elaborate faked death (Arc 11) involving the Auditors disguised as a villain team called "The Washes," with Kate playing the role of Mouthwash. Sam took three bullets from Mrs. Quiet to sell the deception.

Kate relocated to Center City under the name Kay Smith, dyeing her hair brown and wearing chunky black-frame glasses. She now works as a licensed juvenile metahuman contractor in mold and gas remediation, attends Bodine International High School, and has cleared her father's debts. She continues to struggle with her addiction to action, attending underground metahuman fight clubs and maintaining a secret chemistry lab to test her powers.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Category | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| **Power Classification** | Filch: Gaseous Particulate Absorption (F4/SE/P/R) |
| **Power Ranking** | 4/10 |
| **Control** | 8/10 |
| **Hostility** | 0/10 |
| **Collateral Damage Potential** | 6/10 |
| **Overall Threat Level** | 2/10 |

Assessment conducted July 18, 2025 as part of JLUMA Application #2025-CC-1847 at the Center City Precinct, supervised by Detective Maria Santos. Power classified under "Filch" as it extracts gaseous substances from the environment, affects self and environment (SE), is physical in nature (P), and operates at approximately room-sized radius (R).

### Abilities

- **Gas/Aerosol Absorption** - Can absorb any type of gas, smoke, or aerosol into her body through her skin. This includes toxic substances such as mold spores, mycotoxins, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, chlorine gas, pepper spray, and chemical byproducts. She can store absorbed gases internally without apparent harm to herself.
- **Gas Deployment** - Can release previously absorbed gases through her skin at will, deploying them in controlled bursts or sustained clouds. Uses this offensively for area denial, smoke screens, and targeted chemical attacks. Can release different absorbed substances selectively.
- **Chemical Smoke Manipulation** - Primarily uses her power to absorb and redeploy smoke and chemical compounds, creating obscuring clouds, deploying pepper spray-laced smoke, or releasing noxious gases to incapacitate targets. As Soot, she used carbon monoxide gas offensively to incapacitate drug dealers during operations.
- **Toxic Processing** - Can process harmful airborne substances at extraordinary rates. During remediation work, she processed black mold concentrations at eleven times the expected level, clearing jobs in six hours that would normally take three days.

### Limitations

- **Physical Toll** - Processing large volumes of toxic substances takes a physical toll on her body, even though the gases themselves do not technically harm her.
- **No Inherent Combat Powers** - Her abilities are utility-based rather than directly offensive. She relies on martial arts training and chemical knowledge to make her powers dangerous in combat.
- **Recognition Risk** - As a supposedly dead vigilante, any use of her powers in public risks exposing her new identity.

### Training & Skills

- Exceptional basketball player with athleticism and competitive drive that carried over into vigilante work.
- Extensively trained in martial arts across every dojo in Northeast Philadelphia - jiu-jitsu, kickboxing, and aikido - spending "every unused penny" on training. Capable of fighting experienced metahumans using technique alone.
- Amateur chemist who systematically catalogs the absorption and deployment properties of household chemicals in a detailed spreadsheet. Maintains plausible deniability since all chemicals appear as normal household items.
- Tactical planning and team coordination experience from leading Team Mayfly.
- Proficient with non-lethal weapons including tasers, wrist-mounted pepper spray canisters, and gas masks.
- Licensed juvenile metahuman contractor for hazardous material remediation.

## Personality

Kate is intensely Catholic, carrying deep religious guilt that colors her worldview and self-perception. She believes herself damned to hell based on visions she experienced during her clinical death, and she attends weekly confession at St. Augustine's without disclosing what she considers her real sins. She is a lesbian and harbors romantic feelings for Sam that she confessed during Arc 11, though Sam does not reciprocate. Her parish priest Father Patrick teaches that God loves all children, but Kate interprets Church doctrine as demanding abstinence or damnation. She described her Soot persona as part outlet for rage, part penance - a "sin eater" philosophy where she does the dirty work so Sam can remain "light and clean." She is snarky, precise, methodical, and morally absolutist, holding rigid views even as she struggles with her own perceived failures.

Beneath the sharp exterior, Kate grapples with class resentment, feelings of abandonment, and an addictive need for action that mirrors Sam's own compulsions. She acknowledges having "the same poison Sam does." Her legitimate post-Soot life is merely "tolerable" - she dreams about mixing chemicals and hunting Kingdom dealers, and feels more at home in the fight club than anywhere since leaving Tacony. Her confessions omit what she considers her real sins: "I let someone else take bullets for me. I abandoned my mission. I ran away." Her father's encouragement falls on deaf ears; Kate's philosophy is that someone who has been to hell does not get to save herself but can only try to make it mean something.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Introduced as one of Sam's close friends during a pickup basketball game where Liberty Belle first approaches Sam. Described as tomboyish with short-cropped sandy hair, freckles, and pink skin, like Sam's "weird alternate universe fraternal twin." Known for hustling sixth graders at Horse for money. She and Sam play basketball together before splitting to attend different high schools - Kate to Abraham Lincoln High School, Sam to Tacony Academy Charter. Kate mispronounces "kvetching" during their farewell conversation. Their friendship remains strong despite the separation, as they are still neighbors ("like three houses down") and stay connected through chatrooms.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Hosts Sam's friend group (Sam, Kate, Marcus, Lilly, Jenna, Tasha) at her father's first-floor apartment in Mayfair, a worn space with a faded futon, mismatched cushions, vintage movie posters, and a scarred coffee table. Kate's father Liam - tall with salt-and-vanilla hair and a thick white/blonde beard - gives Kate money before going outside to smoke. Sam reveals she already has a superhero costume, team, and codename. Kate gets a box cutter and rolls up her sleeves, revealing "smooth, pale skin," and disinfects it with a Zippo and rubbing alcohol before testing Sam's healing factor - the shallow cut visibly knits back together within seconds. Kate's financial situation is apparent throughout: she counts coins for water ice, wears worn-out jeans, and lives modestly. Afterward, Kate pays for the group's water ice at Rita's on Frankford Avenue, with Sam asking permission for the 50-cent add-on, conscious of Kate's finances. During the gathering, Kate suggests with unusual intensity that Sam should target "loan sharks" and "slumlords," getting defensive when questioned before playing it off as a joke - hinting at something personal beneath the surface related to her father's debts. Kate is identified as "the leader in our motley crew" and tells Sam she has "always had a superhero heart" and is "the best of us." Later, Kate attends Sam's neighborhood party in an action movie costume, drinking beer (three cans) with a "chip on her shoulder" softened by alcohol.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam and Jamila attend Kate's basketball scrimmage at Abraham Lincoln High School (the "Railsplitters," yellow and black colors), a school eight times larger than Tacony in a noticeably underfunded neighborhood with cracked sidewalks and graffiti. Kate demonstrates exceptional skill - spin moves, three-pointers, court vision - described as a natural. Post-game conversation reveals growing distance between Sam and Kate; Sam reflects that she "hasn't been a great friend lately" with "more secrets to keep, more reasons to drift apart." Sam accidentally shoves Kate hard enough to send her staggering several feet, not knowing her own strength, prompting Kate to really look at Sam's changed body for the first time - the arms, legs, calluses, and dense leathery knuckles. Kate's father has taken a second job, adding to the underlying tension. Jamila introduces herself as Sam's girlfriend to Kate for the first time. Kate is also referenced in earlier chapters through text messages expressing concern and sharing school gossip and photos while Sam recovers from injuries at the Chen house.

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Visits Sam in the hospital alongside the school friend group (Marcus, Lilly, Jenna, Tasha) and Kate's dad during her recovery from radiation injuries (Ch. 64). Shaved her head in solidarity with Sam's radiation-induced hair loss, described as butch-presenting. The friends reveal they merged friend groups while Sam was unconscious, and Lily Chen and Kate have become friends despite previously not knowing each other. Kate's bluntness is described as a "much-needed reality check." Kate used her logic to deduce Sam's secret identity: "You got radiation poisoning. Then a radioactive supervillain turns himself in like two weeks later."

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Main

    Interlude MM.1 introduces Kate as Miss Mayfly operating in Northeast Philadelphia, changing into gear in the alley behind "Tom's," her father's favorite pub on Frankford Avenue. Her team stops a credit union robbery by criminals wearing knock-off superhero masks (Peregrine, Captain Steel, Railgun, Lady Justice), deploying military-grade stink bombs via drones within a coordinated 60-second operational window while Wasp calls police. Kate takes a crowbar strike to the ribs during the engagement, later assessed as "just a sprain with impressive bruising" by Moth. Interlude MM.2 reveals Kate's team conducting multi-day rotating surveillance of Sam and Jordan, tracking their patrols and identifying the Dobson Mills warehouse in East Falls. The team expands their drone fleet to 16 units (4 parent drones with 3 "child" drones each) equipped with LIDAR sensors and coordinated flight patterns. Moth develops paint bombs as distraction devices and studies warehouse blueprints with Wasp, identifying a skylight as a key entry point. The team deploys around the warehouse at sunset with Wasp and Moth on the roof, Mite and Ant in a "Mobile Control Unit," and Kate on the ground. During the Dobson Mills warehouse battle, Miss Mayfly charges through smoke but does not understand Ricochet's kinetic absorption powers, inadvertently charging him up with full baton swings. Sparkplug grabs Kate by her ponytail and drags her as a hostage until Jordan (Safeguard) threatens Sparkplug at gunpoint, forcing her release. Sam recognizes Kate's identity when her gas mask shatters and rushes to provide emergency medical care, tearing strips of costume for pressure bandages and using burn relief spray from Kate's own utility belt. Kate sustains electrical burns with Lichtenberg (fractal) scarring across her lower left torso, up into her sports bra area and over her shoulder. Sam notes the burns are on "the exact opposite side of my propeller scar." Kate refuses hospitalization due to lack of insurance. Sundial reveals she knew Kate was unpowered and helps craft a cover story for paramedics. Officer William Gold - the same officer who conducted Sam's JLUMA interview - recognizes Sam and subtly guides other officers away from Kate without being asked.

    The full Team Mayfly is revealed at a joint meeting (Ch. 83): Kate, Tasha Reynolds, Lilly Rodriguez, Marcus Johnson, and Jenna Nguyen - all Sam's school friends, all unpowered civilians. Sam publicly "grounds" Miss Mayfly to increase accountability; the team is compromised to a tech support and surveillance-only role. Kate's wrist-mounted pepper spray canister, built by Tasha, is incorporated into Sam's tactical plan to capture Sparkplug, modified into an injector glove delivering xylazine and ketamine. Kate provides drone reconnaissance and buys Sam a hammer for window breaking during the Sparkplug operation.

    In Chapter 85, Kate texts Sam at 3 AM requesting a meeting at their old basketball court in Mayfair, wearing her partially-destroyed Miss Mayfly costume without a mask. Kate reveals she took Jump pills ("rummaged through some guy's pockets") to gain iron/metal skin, which blocks Sam's blood sense entirely. Kate's emotional core erupts: "You abandoned our entire friend group to go to some fancy charter school" and "YOU HAD RESPONSIBILITIES TO YOUR FRIENDS, TOO!" Kate's fighting form is described as perfect, "honed by months, maybe even years of training." The Jump makes her weigh an estimated 500-550 pounds with lime-green tears. The fight includes spinebuster slams, shoulder rams, and a simultaneous face punch exchange. Kate concedes ("You win. I'll hang up my costume") but collapses after three steps as the Jump wears off - Kate won physically but Sam won morally. A kindergarten flashback reveals their first meeting: Kate with "really bright light blonde hair and bright green eyes," shy and quiet, bonding with Sam over basketball (Kate loved Allen Iverson) versus soccer (Sam loved Ronaldo Jimenez).

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Strained relationship between Sam and Kate following their basketball court fight. Kate is "holed up in her room most days." Sam checks on Kate through Kate's dad but maintains distance. The neighborhood basketball court still bears scars from their fight - nobody fixed it. Kate is still estranged from the wider friend group, with Jenna and Lilly drifting away alongside her, though Marcus keeps in touch and Tasha spends time at the Music Hall making gadgets. Sam refuses to tell adults about Kate taking Jump.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Kate's name is used as a cover story by Tasha, whose parents think she is out with "troubled friend Kate." Sam's stomach clenches at the mention, recalling "the vicious, desperate way she came at me during our last fight." Tasha references her time as "Miss Mayfly" during a moral debate with Sam about the ethics of vigilantism.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Kate's house on Revere and Longshore in Mayfair is destroyed in a fire. Aaron McKinley is the primary suspect, but the fire's origin is ambiguous - Aaron denied responsibility when directly questioned, claiming it wasn't his "kind" of fire, and Kate herself had both the means and motive to have started it. Sam knows the house by heart despite not having been over in two years - it is around the corner, one row behind Sam's street. Kate's father Liam is outside barefoot in sweatpants and a stained T-shirt, his hands raw, red, and blistered from trying to reach Kate, trembling and panicked. Sam calls Crossroads for backup and enters the burning building despite being told to wait. She finds Kate in her upstairs bedroom using blood sense - Kate's blood rhythm "weaker than it should be, scattered like drops from a broken faucet." Kate is slumped against a wall, unconscious, with cuts on her forearms running lengthwise - "too deliberate to be anything but intentional" - indicating self-harm before the fire. Sam gives Kate her own oxygen mask and carries her down, but the stairs collapse. Sam shouts to the crowd below and drops Kate from a second-story window into a blanket held by Liam and three neighbors. Sam performs CPR when Kate's airway swells shut from smoke and heat damage, cycling through 30 compressions and 2 breaths. Crossroads arrives with paramedics who take over. Interlude MM.3 is a hospital admission report from Jefferson Frankford Hospital documenting Kate's condition: critical carboxyhemoglobin levels at 24%, intubation, first-degree burns, and the puzzling observation that particulate matter in her lungs was "disproportionately low" relative to the fire's severity - the first hint of her gas absorption powers activating. The report also documents "previous lightning strike injury (recovered)" with residual Lichtenberg scarring from the Sparkplug fight.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting / Interlude

    Living with the Small family during recovery, using an incentive spirometer for lung rehabilitation. Sam helps Kate with geometry homework (Heron's formula). Kate sees Dr. Alvarez for therapy while Sam attends physical therapy; Rachel Small drives them together. Sam and Kate race competitively through a physical therapy obstacle course. Kate and her father prepare to move out as their debts are mysteriously paid off by anonymous benefactors - implied to be money from Kate's Soot operations. Kate is painting her nails and planning to move, though the money is not quite enough yet. Sam first encounters the mysterious vigilante Soot in Chapter 153 - a figure in a gas mask and fingerless gloves robbing a loan shark named Gregory Winters using noxious smoke and pepper spray. Soot knows Sam's real name, calling her "Smalls," and has pink fingernails visible through fingerless gloves. Sam builds a five-point evidence chain linking Kate to Soot: Kate is always out at night; Kate's painted nails match Soot's pink fingernails; they are never in the same place at the same time; anonymous money is paying off Liam's debts while Soot steals money; and Kate nearly died from smoke inhalation then a smoke-controlling vigilante appears. Sam's surveillance catches Kate returning home at 3:04 AM on a night when Soot was sighted from 11:40 PM to 12:20 AM in Germantown. Soot provides intelligence about a major Jump shipment at the Pennsport marina to the Auditors through Jordan. During the Stheno Biopharma warehouse infiltration, Soot appears with smoke and threatens to release approximately 80 cubic feet of stored chlorine gas as a "nuclear option" to destroy the facility. Sam's gauntlet is rebuilt from Miss Mayfly's original wrist-mounted design, incorporating pig blood spray for tracking, pepper spray, and tooth slots. At the Rogue Wave marina confrontation, Sam fights Soot briefly before Turbo Jett interrupts; Soot is holding back and not fighting Sam at full capacity.

    Interlude So.1 follows Soot's POV conducting operations in early April 2025. Soot describes a growth spurt - now the same height as Bloodhound at approximately 5'8" - and references "knowing what my mom and dad look like," implying she will keep growing. She infiltrates a dealer gathering to negotiate a drugs-for-Jump trade; when a dealer pulls a gun, Soot releases colorless, odorless carbon monoxide gas from her hands while protected by a CPAP-style mask, incapacitating the dealers within minutes. At her warehouse base, she processes chemicals, treats injuries, and considers disposal of acquired Jump. Bloodhound tracks Soot and confronts her, leading to an extended philosophical clash: Soot frames her worldview through Catholic concepts of sin and debt, while Bloodhound argues from a Jewish ethical framework that "you do good because being a good person is its own reward." A charged moment occurs when Sam thinks "it would be so easy to punch her from this close. Or kiss her." Soot voluntarily surrenders a bag of Jump pills to Bloodhound, saying "do what you want with it."

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam confronts Kate about being Soot after arriving home from the Stheno warehouse operation at 3:15 AM; Kate denies everything stone-cold, though Sam notices Kate's laptop was left open to a secure chat. Their exchange closes with characteristic banter: "Night... Sleep well, bitch." / "Night... Don't let the bed bugs bite, whore." Kate and Liam are packing to move as insurance money and a "mysterious benefactor" have come through. In Chapter 170, Sam observes Kate coming home at 2:47 AM smelling of excessive body spray (covering smoke smell) and warns her that the Kingdom is hunting Soot. Kate takes Sam to her safehouse - an abandoned row house near Tulip Street at the waterfront with a boarded-up exterior and padlocked hidden door. Inside: cleaning supplies (bleach, ammonia, drain cleaner, industrial solvents), multiple CPAP machines in various states of disassembly, stolen pharmaceuticals, stacks of cash in small bills, a chemical tripwire booby trap that dumps drain cleaner on intruders, and a back closet converted to a headquarters with a corkboard of maps and clippings, a sleeping bag, a laptop, and gas mask components. By showing Sam the hideout, Kate implicitly confirms she is Soot.

    Kate reveals her full backstory: she was clinically dead for three minutes and forty-two seconds after the house fire and experienced a vision of fire, burning, and light that she interprets as having seen hell. She believes she is damned because she is a lesbian and has been in love with Sam for years. Her Catholic guilt is compounded by Father Patrick's teaching that God loves all children alongside doctrine demanding abstinence or damnation. The Soot identity serves partly as an outlet for rage and partly as penance - a "sin eater" philosophy where she does the dirty work so Sam can stay "light and clean." Sam does not reciprocate romantically ("I've never thought about you that way") but is supportive, suggesting Kate's "hell vision" may have been a power manifestation rather than actual damnation. Kate's powers are confirmed as absorbing and releasing vapors - the smoke particles from the fire were in her lungs and then her skin "ate" them.

    Sam feeds Mr. Antithesis a carefully calibrated mix of truth and lies about Kate during a face-to-face meeting in Manhattan, providing Kate's real safehouse location (already cleared out) and saying Soot is a girl named Kate whose house burned down during the McKinley rampage. The Kingdom's Soot bounty represents approximately $80 million in damages to their operations. Interlude So.2 details the faked death operation, in which Sam wears Soot's costume while the Auditors disguise themselves as "The Washes" - Brainwash (Amelia Li), Powerwash (Lily Chen), and Mouthwash (Kate Smith). As Mouthwash, Kate used her chemical smoke powers to exhale endothermic substances and liquid nitrogen effects, selling the fake villain persona. Kate is punched by Mr. Retribution during the encounter, leaving a bruise on her cheek.

    On the final night before Kate moves out, Sam challenges Kate to a rematch at their basketball court (Ch. 176). Kate reveals the extent of her martial arts training: she trained at every dojo in Northeast Philadelphia, including jiu-jitsu at Chen's on Frankford, kickboxing at Mighty Muay Thai, and aikido at a studio next to Acme, spending "every unused penny." Kate is faster, more fluid, and more precise than Sam, using her gas powers subtly - puffs of disorienting chemicals, carbon monoxide, pepper spray directly to Sam's face, and nitrous oxide ("borrowed from a dentist"). Sam fights at roughly 50% capacity due to healing gunshot wounds. Kate lands a final aikido throw, pins Sam, and wins the fight, tearing open Sam's wound in the process ("at least a week's worth of healing" undone). Kate patches Sam up with first aid supplies from her jacket. Kate becomes "Kay Smith" with newly dyed brown hair (Sam dyes it after Kate's own attempt was a "patchy orange-brown disaster") and chunky black-frame glasses. Kate's final exchange with Sam: "You think I'm going to stop?" Sam: "No." Kate: "Me neither." Liam's ancient Corolla departs loaded with all their possessions.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Kate (now Kay) has relocated to Center City after faking Soot's death, approximately three weeks before the arc opens. Aaron McKinley receives a 38-year sentence at Daedalus. Her departure is one of the key losses the Auditors face as they reorganize.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam visits Kate at her apartment near Rittenhouse Square during Day 8 of her fugitive operations, taking the Broad Street Line to Center City. Kate now has brown hair (was blonde), is shorter than Sam remembers, and wears jeans and a hoodie. She works mold remediation as an independent contractor, booked three weeks out, and has cleared her father's debts as of the previous week. Her first personal purchase after clearing debts was a real bed. Kate admits she attends underground metahuman boxing matches but only watches, not participating: "I like being adjacent to it... knowing I could if I wanted to but choosing not to." She describes herself as a "human pepper spray dispenser." When Sam asks if she is enjoying the fugitive operations, Kate responds that it makes sense - Sam is good at it, her powers make her good at it, and feeling competent is natural. They discuss Hyperball (a sport for superhumans), bonding over missing basketball and soccer respectively. Kate forces Sam to sleep in her bed while she guards from the couch ("I'm standing guard"), and Sam sleeps ten hours straight. The next morning, Kate's father Liam arrives in his silver Prius - he now does admin work managing construction crews with better pay and hours. Liam makes scrambled eggs, tells Sam "your dad would do the same for Katie if she needed it. Ben and I go back. We're friends," gives Sam $300 cash and packs pierogies for the road. Kate's parting words: "Don't die... I already faked my death once. I don't want to have to come back from the dead to attend your funeral."

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned / Interlude

    Texts Sam a brief warning during the Shrike crisis: "Be careful." This represents rare contact - Kate is mostly distant from Sam during this period. Tasha's drone system, inherited from the Kate/Miss Mayfly era, is used by the Auditors during the Shrike investigation. Sam adds "Kaitlyn Smith" to her protection list despite their tension.

    Interlude So.3 (mid-November 2025) reveals Kate's post-Soot life in Center City through her POV. Licensed as "KAITLYN SMITH - LICENSED JUVENILE METAHUMAN CONTRACTOR," wearing a work mask with her name and a monitoring wristband tracker, working 30 hours/week max and 6 hours/day due to minor labor restrictions. She processes black mold at 11 times the expected concentration, earning triple completion bonuses and quadruple her hourly rate. She relocated from Tacony six months prior; her father is clean from gambling, working construction management, and arriving in a silver Prius. Kate's grades are fine at Bodine International High School but the school counselor reports she is "distant" and missing appointments. She has no friends at school and college applications are ahead.

    Kate maintains a secret chemistry lab in her apartment building's basement, systematically testing household chemicals in a spreadsheet with columns for Compound, Vapor Properties, Absorption Feel, and Deployment Effect. Key findings include isopropyl alcohol (flammable vapor, rapid dispersion, brief ignition), ammonia (effective area denial, obvious chemical presence), heavy vapors (sink fast, good for ground-level cover), and theatrical fog juice (glycerin/water mixture producing thick, non-alarming, sustained obscurement). She also keeps her old Soot gas mask hidden behind a brick in an abandoned Tacony building.

    Kate attends an underground metahuman fight club in an abandoned boxing gym basement near Passyunk Avenue in South Philadelphia (Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday nights, $50 cover), using a fake ID claiming she is 21, vouched for by her coworker Marco (approximately 24, lean, remediation crew member). She observes matches and learns fighter tactics but has not yet competed. The fight club has specific rules: no weapons (unless part of a power), no killing, referee calls knockouts and submissions, and newcomer qualifier matches run at 10 PM before the main card.

    Kate performs weekly confession at St. Augustine's church but doesn't tell the priest anything real. Her omitted sins: "I let someone else take bullets for me. I abandoned my mission. I ran away." She reflects that she has "the same poison Sam does" - addiction to action and combat - and feels more at home in the fight club than anywhere since leaving Tacony. Sam texts: "Hey stranger. Derek says hi. So does Maggie. Miss your stupid face. You doing okay?" Kate does not respond but does not delete the contact.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** Interlude

    Interlude So.4 is a document-format chapter presenting Kate's JLUMA (Juvenile Licensed Use of Metahuman Abilities) Application #2025-CC-1847, dated July 18, 2025 - a flash-forward approximately five months after the current story events. The application establishes Kate's full legal name as Kaitlyn Smith, date of birth April 3, 2009, and her power classification as Filch: Gaseous Particulate Absorption (F4/SE/P/R) with a power ranking of 4/10, control rating of 8/10, and overall threat level of 2/10. Kate describes her power origin: during the February 2025 house fire, she passed out from smoke and woke up in the hospital having somehow absorbed all the smoke in the room, with completely clear lungs. She accidentally released stored smoke in the hospital room, setting off alarms.

    The application includes her metahuman safety certification practical assessment results under supervisor James Grayson: she reduced mold spore levels from 75,000 PPM to 340 PPM in 23 minutes, demonstrated precise control absorbing and releasing 2.1 cubic meters of ammonia vapor, and achieved 98.7% filtration accuracy in selective particulate removal. Grayson's assessment calls her "one of the most naturally talented" metahuman contractors he has encountered in six years.

    When asked about previous vigilante activity, Kate checks "No" - dramatic irony given her extensive history as both Miss Mayfly and Soot. Her school integration report from counselor Patricia Morgan at Bodine International School notes her 3.3 GPA, strength in sciences (Biology: A, Chemistry: A-), and describes her as "quiet but engaged." Liam's parental consent statement reads: "We're in a tough spot financially - that's my fault, not hers." The permit is approved July 25, 2025, supervised by Detective Maria Santos.

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam adds Kaitlyn Smith to her protection list despite their tension. Soot's old storehouse near Sam's school is used as a hiding place by Sam and Amelia after a confrontation with Patriot during the blizzard. Mrs. Quiet's mention of Sam's grandfather Victor during the faked death interrogation becomes intelligence the Kingdom later uses against the Small family.

## Trivia

- Kate shaved her head in solidarity when Sam lost her hair from radiation exposure during the Chernobyl crisis.
- As Miss Mayfly, Kate operated without superpowers. Team Mayfly's headquarters was Kate's own bedroom, and their motto was "Together, we soar."
- Kate considers her Catholic theology in relation to her powers, wondering whether they are "miracles" or "charisms" from her resurrection experience.
- Kate beat Sam in both of their one-on-one fights: the first (Arc 5) she won physically via Jump-enhanced iron skin but conceded morally, and the second (Arc 11) she won outright using martial arts and gas powers against a recovering Sam. Sam's blood sense cannot detect Kate when she has taken Jump - "like trying to read a blank page."
- Her Lichtenberg scarring from Sparkplug's electrical attack in Arc 5 is located on her left flank, upper torso, left shoulder, and lower back.
- Kate's kindergarten self had "really bright light blonde hair and bright green eyes." Her friendship with Sam began over a shared love of sports - Kate for basketball and Allen Iverson, Sam for soccer and Ronaldo Jimenez.
- Her JLUMA power demonstration involved absorbing cigarette smoke from outside the building and releasing it in a thin, controlled stream that dissipated within seconds.
