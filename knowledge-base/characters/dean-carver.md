## Background

Dean Carver is a 28-year-old metahuman who serves as the distribution specialist for Rogue Wave, operating under the codename "Rush Order." Prior to joining, Dean worked as a delivery driver and cable installer. He discovered his superhuman speed while fleeing loan sharks, an experience that shaped his worldview around freedom and velocity as the highest virtues.

Within Rogue Wave, Dean coordinates contracted dealers, manages territory, and serves as Monkey Business's primary field agent. He is one of the six core members featured in the organization's televised manifesto broadcast (Arc 10) and was publicly identified as the delivery specialist.

Dean lacks the deep ideological commitment of colleagues like Dead Drop or Snake Oil. His motivations are personal and pragmatic - he enjoys operating above the law, relishes the freedom his speed affords him, and treats his criminal career with a theatrical flair that suggests he views the whole enterprise as a performance worth staging.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Superhuman Speed (Subconscious Biodynamic Control)** - Dean's body automatically compensates for any movement he wants to make through subconscious biodynamic control. His reflexes, acceleration, and movement speed vastly exceed normal human limits, giving him an overwhelming advantage against most opponents in combat (Arc 12).
- **Subconscious Aerokinesis** - A passive ability that nullifies air resistance during movement, allowing superhuman velocities without lethal friction, drag, or thermal effects. Also functions as a partial defensive barrier against pressure-based attacks, though it cannot fully overcome sustained barokinetic force in enclosed spaces (DC.3).
- **Person Location ("Pigeon Sense") (Fly-Granted)** - A Fly-granted ability allowing Dean to locate any individual whose full legal name he knows, functioning like a carrier pigeon's homing instinct. He describes it as "like a compass magnet in my brain" and colloquially calls the sensation "yankety yankety."

### Limitations

- Must plant his feet before accelerating - a biomechanical "tell" that Sam identified during their South Street fight (Arc 12) using Multiplex's training techniques.
- His speed advantage is primarily linear; opponents who anticipate his planting motion or force close-quarters engagements may find brief windows.
- Not invulnerable - can be injured by conventional firearms (shot in the shoulder by Benjamin Small, Arc 12).
- His aerokinesis can be overwhelmed by sustained barokinetic force in enclosed spaces (DC.3).

### Training & Skills

- Logistics and distribution management experience from his prior career as a delivery driver and cable installer.
- Proficient with firearms; carries a revolver.
- Skilled hand-to-hand combatant who leverages his speed advantage effectively.
- Adept at reconnaissance and stealth operations (e.g., disguising himself as a delivery person for the Arc 14 negotiation).

## Personality

Dean is cocky, irreverent, and theatrical, approaching criminal enterprise and combat with a showman's instinct for spectacle. He values freedom and speed above all else, treating his powers as the purest expression of what he believes life should be. When asked the difference between criminals and supervillains, his answer was simple: style.

Beneath the bravado, Dean possesses a calculating intelligence that his flamboyance obscures. He can show sound tactical judgment - calling off a pursuit when outmatched (DC.3) and honestly assessing situations without ego. He operates from a self-interested position dressed up in Rogue Wave's rhetoric when convenient, lacking the ideological purity of teammates like Dead Drop.

His relationship with Sam Small is perhaps the most revealing aspect of his character: he wants to be the one who beats her, yet repeatedly provides her with crucial intelligence and warnings. He respects Benjamin Small for shooting him rather than resenting the injury, treating it as a consequence of his own carelessness. This capacity for admiring people who stand their ground against him suggests a code of personal honor underneath his performative villainy.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business) | Leader / Employer | Reports directly to Sullivan as primary field agent and distribution coordinator. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary / Developing rapport | A complicated dynamic evolving from antagonism toward a strange villainous quasi-friendship. Dean wants to be the one who beats Sam but repeatedly provides her with warnings and intelligence. |
| Benjamin Small ("Gun Dad") | Mutual respect | Shot Dean during the South Street confrontation. Dean respects rather than resents this, later declaring Ben under Rogue Wave's protection via public video. |
| Mai-Anh "Annie" Vo (Birthday Suit) | Teammate | Fellow core Rogue Wave member. |
| Renee Costello (Dead Drop) | Teammate / Field partner | Dean's primary field partner. He describes them as "a good team" with complementary abilities (speed and reach), having "run this play a dozen times on Kingdom couriers and drug shipments." She drives while he navigates with his pigeon sense. |
| Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Target (reassigned to avoidance) | After the failed DC.3 capture attempt revealed her true barokinetic power, Monkey Business reclassified Maya as "a hazard to be routed around, not an objective to be pursued." |
| Dr. Felix Ortega (Snake Oil) | Teammate | Rogue Wave's chemist who treated Dean's gunshot wound after the South Street fight. |
| Elias Franklin (Chimera) | Teammate | Assisted with Dean's medical treatment at the Camden safehouse. |
| Tomas Reynoso (Jackpot) | Teammate | Fellow core Rogue Wave member. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appeared as one of the six core Rogue Wave members in their televised NBC10 manifesto broadcast, publicly identified as the organization's delivery specialist (Ch. 158).

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Featured in Interlude LS.1, where he reported a 22% increase in contract distribution with 92% retention during a strategic planning meeting at Rogue Wave headquarters. The report demonstrates Rogue Wave's continued expansion despite Jordan Westwood's exposure of the contract enforcement vulnerability.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Arrived on motorcycle at the Sunoco station to extract Dead Drop during the confrontation with the Auditors, leaving Marathon (a lower-level Rogue Wave dealer) and his crew behind to prioritize a core member's escape (Chapter 182). Tasha later identified Rush Order and Dead Drop from the May broadcast footage, confirming them as core Rogue Wave operatives. Confronted Bloodhound on South Street in a deliberately staged public fight (Chapter 188), demonstrating overwhelming speed advantage and delivering Rogue Wave's ideological message to the crowd and cameras. Benjamin Small intervened, leading to a gunfire exchange in which both men were wounded. Dean was shot in the left shoulder and retreated to the Camden safehouse. Featured in the Rush Order section of Interlude RS/DC/JF recovering at a Camden safehouse, where Snake Oil and Elias Franklin tend to his gunshot wound and facial lacerations while Monkey Business monitors the online reaction to the incident. Dean describes Sam's tooth-from-knuckles ability to teammates (comparing it to Wolverine's claws) and confirms the fight was a deliberate publicity stunt, expressing satisfaction that it has gone viral and is driving both gun sales and Jump distribution. The team debates Bloodhound's identity and whether to target her again. Dead Drop and Jackpot return with food, leading to a team dinner and philosophical discussion about Rogue Wave's cause. Dean reaffirms his commitment despite his injuries. Released a public video declaring "Gun Dad" under Rogue Wave's protection, challenging Bloodhound to a rematch while praising her resilience.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as Rogue Wave's ongoing presence in the escalating three-way conflict between vigilante heroes, government-sanctioned forces, and criminal organizations across Philadelphia.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Mentioned alongside Monkey Business as a potential resource during the Shrike crisis (Chapter 204). Arrived at the Tacony Music Hall disguised as a delivery person bringing pizza during the Rogue Wave negotiation (Chapter 205). Confirmed that Ben Small's protection had been active since his video. Drew weapons briefly when Sam cut Monkey Business's hand but stood down. Privately revealed to Sam that Maya Richardson was not actually in Harrisburg during the senate hearings, describing this intelligence as "a curse, not help." Returned in Chapter 206 to collect the list of people needing protection, confirming his location-sensing ability and stating Maya had been "way more North" in New York State. Sent a warning text to Sam's Rogue Wave burner phone ("Square up. Run. -RO") before a Kingdom contractor attacked the Music Hall (Chapter 217).

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Major (Interlude DC.2)

    Receives Sam's text about Kingdom evidence disposal at Roxborough Memorial Hospital (Chapter 220) and responds with a single smiley face emoji. Featured as narrator of Interlude DC.2, depicting the Polygraph extraction operation from Rogue Wave's side: uses the geased private investigator Rick as bait at Roxborough for three days. When Mr. Polygraph and Mr. Nothing arrive on Thursday, Dead Drop's chains subdue Kingdom operatives while Rush Order personally captures Polygraph. At the Camden warehouse, Snake Oil extracts Polygraph's lie-detection power through 90 seconds of direct neck contact, the ability crystallizing as a blue-green crystal from Snake Oil's hand. The crystal becomes raw material for Fly. Monkey Business prepares Polygraph for transport and tips police after forty-five minutes. Monkey Business texts Sam confirming her debt is paid but warns never to involve police in Rogue Wave dealings again. Referenced later when Sam cites Rush Order's earlier intel about Maya not being in Harrisburg as evidence supporting the existence of a Kingdom shapeshifter (Chapter 224).

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** POV (Interlude DC.3)

    Narrated an interlude set during a winter storm in which he and Dead Drop tracked Maya Richardson to a rooftop in Northeast Philadelphia using his person-location ability. The pair observed that the blizzard was concentrated unnaturally over Northeast Philly and deduced someone was generating it. After locating Maya on a six-story industrial building's roof conducting weather manipulation, they attempted to capture her. Dead Drop's chains snagged Maya's ankle and wrist, and Dean grabbed her coat, but Maya broke free using a taser, pepper spray, and physical resistance. In the enclosed stairwell, Maya sealed the fire door and demonstrated devastating barokinetic power - creating crushing pressure gradients, stopping Dead Drop's gyroscopically stabilized chain-link projectiles mid-flight, and slamming Dean against a concrete wall with directed air pressure. Dean's passive aerokinesis partially protected him from the worst of the crushing force but could not fully counteract it. Dead Drop broke the pressure seal by tearing the fire door off its hinges with brute ferrokinesis, and Maya escaped by dropping down the stairwell center using controlled pressure descent. Dean sustained a sprained or fractured left ankle, cracked ribs, and a nosebleed from the pressure exposure. The pair retreated to the Camden safehouse, where Dean delivered a factual debrief to Monkey Business. Sullivan concluded that Maya Richardson was no longer a viable target for direct action and should be "routed around, not pursued." Dean confirmed the intelligence value of the encounter: Maya's true power was pressure manipulation rather than weather control, indoor spaces were kill zones, projectile weapons were neutralized within her effective range, and she carried conventional self-defense tools (taser and mace) as backup. Dead Drop noted Maya could use pressure for three-dimensional mobility via controlled falls.


## Trivia

- Dean's interlude code is "DC," with three POV sections: the Rush Order section of Interlude RS/DC/JF (Arc 12), Interlude DC.2 (Mr. Polygraph extraction), and Interlude DC.3 (Maya Richardson encounter).
- He compared Sam's teeth-from-knuckles ability to Wolverine's claws when describing it to teammates.
- He brought pizza as a "peace offering" when arriving at the Music Hall for the Shrike crisis negotiation.
- Marathon, a lower-level Rogue Wave dealer who ran a crew (Brass Knuckles, Baseball Bat, Refrigerator Guy) out of a Sunoco station on Longshore Avenue, is a separate character from Dean. Rush Order's extraction of Dead Drop while leaving Marathon behind established the hierarchy between core and peripheral members.
- He carries a revolver rather than a modern firearm, consistent with his theatrical personality.
- He wears glasses.
- A prolific pop culture referencer: compared Maya's pressure aura to Bleach's reiatsu, called his own sliding maneuver "Megaman-esque," referenced X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and compared Maya to Storm from the X-Men.
