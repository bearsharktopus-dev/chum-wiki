## Background

Dean Carver is a 28-year-old metahuman who serves as the distribution specialist for Rogue Wave, the criminal organization led by Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business) that produces and distributes the metahuman drugs Jump and Fly throughout Philadelphia and the eastern seaboard. Prior to joining Rogue Wave, Dean worked as a delivery driver and cable installer. He discovered his superhuman speed powers while fleeing loan sharks, an experience that fundamentally shaped his worldview around freedom and velocity as the highest virtues.

Within Rogue Wave's organizational structure, Dean operates under the codename "Rush Order" and handles the logistics of Jump distribution across the city. He coordinates contracted dealers, manages territory, and serves as Monkey Business's primary field agent for direct operations. During the Interlude LS.1 strategic planning meeting in June 2025, Rush Order reported a 22% increase in contract distribution with a 92% retention rate following Jordan Westwood's exposure of a contract vulnerability, demonstrating his effectiveness in the role. He is also one of the six core members featured in Rogue Wave's televised manifesto broadcast in April 2025, where he was publicly identified as the organization's delivery specialist.

Dean lacks the deep ideological commitment that drives some of his Rogue Wave colleagues. Unlike Dead Drop's anarchist fervor or Snake Oil's evolutionary philosophy, Dean's motivations are more personal and pragmatic. He enjoys operating above the law, relishes the freedom his speed affords him, and treats his criminal career with a theatrical flair that suggests he views the whole enterprise as a performance worth staging.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Superhuman Speed (Subconscious Biodynamic Control)** - Dean possesses superhuman speed generated through subconscious biodynamic control, meaning his body automatically compensates for any movement he wants to make. His reflexes, acceleration, and movement speed vastly exceed normal human limits. During his South Street confrontation with Bloodhound in Arc 12, he demonstrated an overwhelming speed advantage in combat, systematically outmatching Sam despite her training in pattern recognition from Multiplex.
- **Subconscious Aerokinesis** - Complementing his speed, Dean possesses subconscious aerokinesis that nullifies air resistance during movement. This passive ability allows him to move at superhuman velocities without the friction, drag, and thermal effects that would otherwise make such speeds lethal. During the Interlude DC.3 rooftop confrontation with Maya Richardson, his aerokinesis actively attempted to counteract her barokinetic pressure field, functioning as a partial defensive barrier. Dean described the sensation as his body trying to "equalize" against the crushing atmosphere, and noted that without his aerokinesis, Dead Drop would have been "turned into paste" by the same pressure. However, the aerokinesis could not fully overcome a sustained, concentrated barokinetic assault in an enclosed space.
- **Person Location (Fly Power)** - Dean can locate any individual as long as he knows their full legal name, functioning similarly to a carrier pigeon's homing instinct. He demonstrated this ability during the Rogue Wave negotiation in Arc 14, when he revealed to Sam that Maya Richardson was not actually in Harrisburg during the senate hearings but was instead somewhere in New York State. He described this as being able to sense people's locations once he knows their names.

### Limitations

- Dean must plant his feet before accelerating, a biomechanical "tell" that Sam identified during their South Street fight using Multiplex's training techniques. While Sam was still unable to exploit this effectively, the tell represents a predictable vulnerability in his movement patterns.
- His speed advantage is primarily linear; opponents who can anticipate his planting motion or force close-quarters engagements may find brief windows of opportunity.
- He carries a revolver, suggesting that his speed alone is not always sufficient for resolving confrontations and that he relies on conventional weapons as a supplement.
- He was shot in the shoulder by Benjamin Small during the South Street confrontation, indicating that he is not invulnerable and can be injured by conventional firearms despite his speed.
- His aerokinesis, while providing passive protection against pressure-based attacks, can be overwhelmed by sustained barokinetic force in enclosed spaces, as demonstrated during the DC.3 stairwell confrontation with Maya Richardson, where he sustained cracked ribs, a nosebleed, and a sprained ankle despite his body's attempts to compensate.

### Training & Skills

- Experienced in logistics and distribution management from his prior career as a delivery driver and cable installer, skills that translate directly into his role managing Rogue Wave's drug distribution networks.
- Proficient with firearms; carries a revolver and engaged in a gunfight standoff with Benjamin Small during the South Street confrontation.
- Skilled in hand-to-hand combat, capable of using his speed advantage to systematically dismantle opponents in sustained engagements.
- Adept at reconnaissance and stealth operations, as demonstrated by his approach to the Tacony Music Hall disguised as a delivery person during the Shrike crisis negotiations.

## Personality

Dean Carver is cocky, irreverent, and theatrical, approaching both criminal enterprise and superhuman combat with a showman's instinct for spectacle. He values freedom and speed above all else, treating his powers not merely as tools but as the purest expression of what he believes life should be. His South Street confrontation with Bloodhound was deliberately staged as a public event, complete with crowd engagement, drone footage, and ideological speechmaking. He introduced himself with theatrical flair, drew public attention on purpose, and framed the fight as entertainment as much as combat. When asked the difference between criminals and supervillains, his answer was simple: style.

Despite his theatrical confidence, Dean demonstrated sound tactical judgment during the DC.3 rooftop encounter with Maya Richardson, calling off the pursuit when it became clear they were outmatched and reframing the defeat as an intelligence-gathering success. He acknowledged without ego that Maya "wasn't even trying to kill us" and that she had simply been leaving, a degree of honest self-assessment that contrasts sharply with his usual showmanship.

Beneath the bravado, Dean possesses a calculating intelligence that his flamboyance tends to obscure. He confirmed after the South Street fight that the entire confrontation was a publicity stunt designed to increase Rogue Wave's visibility and drive both gun sales and Jump distribution. He lacks the ideological purity of teammates like Dead Drop, instead operating from a more self-interested position that he dresses up in Rogue Wave's rhetoric when convenient. His relationship with Sam Small is perhaps the most revealing aspect of his character: he wants to be the one who beats her, and he has shown a pattern of providing her with crucial intelligence and warnings even as they remain on opposite sides. He strangely respects Benjamin Small for shooting him rather than resenting the injury, treating it as an acceptable consequence of his own carelessness rather than an affront. This capacity for admiring people who stand their ground against him, even when it costs him, suggests a code of personal honor operating underneath his performative villainy.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business) | Leader / Employer | Dean serves as Monkey Business's primary field agent and distribution coordinator. Reports directly to Sullivan and executes strategic operations on his behalf, including the Mr. Polygraph extraction. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary / Developing rapport | A complicated dynamic that has evolved from pure antagonism toward a strange villainous quasi-friendship. Dean wants to be the one who beats Sam and has repeatedly provided her with warnings and intelligence. He confronted her on South Street, was impressed by her resilience, and later negotiated protection for her family. |
| Benjamin Small ("Gun Dad") | Mutual respect | Ben shot Dean during the South Street confrontation, wounding his shoulder. Dean strangely respects rather than resents this, later releasing a public video declaring Ben under Rogue Wave's protection and framing his actions as exemplifying Rogue Wave's philosophy of individual empowerment. |
| Mai-Anh "Annie" Vo (Birthday Suit) | Teammate | Fellow core Rogue Wave member. Participated together in the Mr. Polygraph extraction and the Shrike crisis negotiation with Sam. |
| Renee Costello (Dead Drop) | Teammate / Field partner | Fellow core Rogue Wave member. Rush Order extracted Dead Drop via motorcycle during the Sunoco station confrontation in Arc 12, leaving Marathon (a lower-level Rogue Wave dealer) and his crew behind to prioritize a core member's escape. Worked together on the Mr. Polygraph extraction. In Interlude DC.3, the pair conducted a joint reconnaissance-turned-ambush on Maya Richardson, demonstrating established tactical coordination: Dean described them as "a good team" with complementary abilities (speed and reach), having "run this play a dozen times on Kingdom couriers and drug shipments." Dead Drop drove while Dean navigated using his person-location sense. She supported him physically after the failed capture, helping him descend six flights of stairs with his injured ankle. |
| Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Target (reassigned to avoidance) | Dean and Dead Drop attempted to capture Maya Richardson on a Northeast Philadelphia rooftop during Interlude DC.3 after tracking her via Dean's person-location ability. The encounter revealed Maya's true power as barokinesis rather than weather control. Maya incapacitated Dean with crushing pressure in an enclosed stairwell and escaped. Dean subsequently briefed Monkey Business, who reclassified Maya as "a hazard to be routed around, not an objective to be pursued." |
| Dr. Felix Ortega (Snake Oil) | Teammate | Rogue Wave's chemist who treated Dean's gunshot wound at the Camden safehouse. Snake Oil hoped Dean would not get shot again, which Dean dismissed as merely being "careless." |
| Elias Franklin (Chimera) | Teammate | Rogue Wave member who assisted with Dean's medical treatment at the Camden safehouse after the South Street fight. |
| Tomas Reynoso (Jackpot) | Teammate | Fellow core Rogue Wave member. Participated in team dinners and philosophical discussions at the safehouse. |

    **Role:** Supporting

    Arrived on motorcycle at the Sunoco station to extract Dead Drop during the confrontation with the Auditors, leaving Marathon (a lower-level Rogue Wave dealer) and his crew behind to prioritize a core member's escape (Chapter 182). Tasha later identified Rush Order and Dead Drop from the May broadcast footage, confirming them as core Rogue Wave operatives. Confronted Bloodhound on South Street in a deliberately staged public fight (Chapter 187), demonstrating overwhelming speed advantage and delivering Rogue Wave's ideological message to the crowd and cameras. Benjamin Small intervened, leading to a gunfire exchange in which both men were wounded. Dean was shot in the shoulder and retreated to an underground clinic in Camden. Featured in the Rush Order section of Interlude RS/DC/JF recovering at a Camden safehouse, where Snake Oil and Elias Franklin tend to his gunshot wound and facial lacerations while Monkey Business monitors the online reaction to the incident. Dean describes Sam's tooth-from-knuckles ability to teammates (comparing it to Wolverine's claws) and confirms the fight was a deliberate publicity stunt, expressing satisfaction that it has gone viral and is driving both gun sales and Jump distribution. The team debates Bloodhound's identity and whether to target her again. Dead Drop and Jackpot return with food, leading to a team dinner and philosophical discussion about Rogue Wave's cause. Dean reaffirms his commitment despite his injuries. Released a public video declaring "Gun Dad" under Rogue Wave's protection, challenging Bloodhound to a rematch while praising her resilience.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as Rogue Wave's ongoing presence in the escalating three-way conflict between vigilante heroes, government-sanctioned forces, and criminal organizations across Philadelphia.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Mentioned alongside Monkey Business as a potential resource during the Shrike crisis (Chapter 204). Arrived at the Tacony Music Hall disguised as a delivery person bringing pizza during the Rogue Wave negotiation (Chapter 205). Confirmed that Ben Small's protection had been active since his video. Drew weapons briefly when Sam cut Monkey Business's hand but stood down. Privately revealed to Sam that Maya Richardson was not actually in Harrisburg during the senate hearings, describing this intelligence as "a curse, not help." Returned in Chapter 206 to collect the list of people needing protection, confirming his location-sensing ability and stating Maya had been "way more North" in New York State. Sent a warning text to Sam's Rogue Wave burner phone ("Square up. Run. -RO") before a Kingdom contractor attacked the Music Hall (Chapter 217).

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Major (Interlude DC.2)

    Receives Sam's text about Kingdom evidence disposal at Roxborough Memorial Hospital (Chapter 220), fulfilling her obligation to Rogue Wave, and responds with a single smiley face emoji. Featured as narrator of Interlude DC.2, depicting the Polygraph extraction operation from Rogue Wave's side: uses the geased private investigator Rick as bait at Roxborough for three days. When Mr. Polygraph and Mr. Nothing arrive on Thursday, Dead Drop's chains subdue Kingdom operatives while Rush Order personally captures Polygraph. At the Camden warehouse, Snake Oil extracts Polygraph's lie-detection power through 90 seconds of direct neck contact, the ability crystallizing as a blue-green crystal from Snake Oil's hand. The crystal becomes raw material for Fly. Monkey Business prepares Polygraph for transport and tips police after forty-five minutes. Texts Sam confirming her debt is paid but warns never to involve police in Rogue Wave dealings again. Referenced later when Sam cites Rush Order's earlier intel about Maya not being in Harrisburg as evidence supporting the existence of a Kingdom shapeshifter (Chapter 224).

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** POV (Interlude DC.3)

    Narrated an interlude set during a winter storm in which he and Dead Drop tracked Maya Richardson to a rooftop in Northeast Philadelphia using his person-location ability. The pair observed that the blizzard was concentrated unnaturally over Northeast Philly and deduced someone was generating it. After locating Maya on a six-story industrial building's roof conducting weather manipulation, they attempted to capture her. Dead Drop's chains snagged Maya's ankle and wrist, and Dean grabbed her coat, but Maya broke free using a taser, pepper spray, and physical resistance. In the enclosed stairwell, Maya sealed the fire door and demonstrated devastating barokinetic power - creating crushing pressure gradients, stopping Dead Drop's gyroscopically stabilized chain-link projectiles mid-flight, and slamming Dean against a concrete wall with directed air pressure. Dean's passive aerokinesis partially protected him from the worst of the crushing force but could not fully counteract it. Dead Drop broke the pressure seal by tearing the fire door off its hinges with brute ferrokinesis, and Maya escaped by dropping down the stairwell center using controlled pressure descent. Dean sustained a sprained or fractured left ankle, cracked ribs, and a nosebleed from the pressure exposure. The pair retreated to the Camden safehouse, where Dean delivered a factual debrief to Monkey Business. Sullivan concluded that Maya Richardson was no longer a viable target for direct action and should be "routed around, not pursued." Dean confirmed the intelligence value of the encounter: Maya's true power was pressure manipulation rather than weather control, indoor spaces were kill zones, projectile weapons were neutralized within her effective range, and she carried conventional self-defense tools (taser and mace) as backup. Dead Drop noted Maya could use pressure for three-dimensional mobility via controlled falls.


## Trivia

- Dean's interlude code is "DC," with Interlude DC.2 being his narrated chapter covering the Mr. Polygraph extraction operation. The existence of a DC.2 designation implies a DC.1 interlude exists earlier in the story.
- He described Sam's teeth-from-knuckles ability to his teammates by comparing it to Wolverine's claws, suggesting familiarity with pop culture references.
- His response to being shot by Benjamin Small was to dismiss it as being "careless" rather than expressing anger or desire for revenge, a reaction that surprised even his own teammates.
- He brought pizza as a "peace offering" when arriving at the Music Hall for the Rogue Wave negotiation during the Shrike crisis, a characteristically theatrical gesture.
- Marathon, a lower-level Rogue Wave dealer who ran a crew (Brass Knuckles, Baseball Bat, Refrigerator Guy) out of a Sunoco station on Longshore Avenue, is a separate character from Dean. Rush Order extracted Dead Drop from the Sunoco confrontation while leaving Marathon and his crew behind, establishing the hierarchy between core and peripheral Rogue Wave members.
- His warning text to Sam before the Garbage Day attack ("Square up. Run. -RO") demonstrated that he monitors Kingdom movements and chose to alert Sam despite their adversarial relationship.
- He carries a revolver rather than a more modern firearm, consistent with his theatrical personality and preference for dramatic flair.
- In Interlude DC.3, Dean described his person-location sense as "like a compass magnet in my brain" and a "tugging my body into a certain orientation in space," and referred to the sensation colloquially as "yankety yankety."
- He wears glasses, as noted when he adjusted them before addressing Maya in the stairwell during DC.3.
- Dean compared Maya's oppressive pressure aura to an anime about "the orange haired dude with the big sword," a reference to Bleach's concept of spiritual pressure (reiatsu).
- During the DC.3 stairwell confrontation, Dean executed a sliding maneuver he mentally described as "Megaman-esque" to jam his ankle through the closing fire door.
- His comfort with pop culture references extends beyond Western media; in addition to the Wolverine comparison from the South Street fight, he referenced X-Men vs. Street Fighter when assessing Maya's combat style and compared her to Storm from the X-Men.
