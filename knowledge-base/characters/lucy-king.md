## Background

Lucy King is a Blasian metahuman who grew up in Tacony, Northeast Philadelphia, within a middle-class family with high expectations. She operates under the alias Sundial and leads the Tacony Titans, a team of young heroes who serve as the defensive, community-oriented counterpart to the Auditors. The Titans were first referenced when Sam's school friends discovered their basic website on NetSphere in September 2023 (Ch. 17), and first appeared in person in late April 2024 at Wissinoming Park (Ch. 70).

Lucy proposed a formal alliance with the Auditors after the failed Squeal sting operation (Ch. 79), which proved critical in subsequent operations against the Jump distribution network and remained a cornerstone of the Northeast Philadelphia vigilante infrastructure. She balances team leadership with independent investigative work, regularly assisting the Delaware Valley Defenders and local law enforcement with cases that benefit from her psychometric abilities.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Psychometry** - Lucy can "read" locations by experiencing events that occurred there up to 24 hours in the past. This manifests as a sensory movie, allowing her to witness past actions in detail sufficient to identify individuals, describe their behavior, and reconstruct timelines. She used this ability to confirm Aaron McKinley as the arsonist behind the Philadelphia fire crisis by reading the burned coffee shop site, and to investigate Jump distribution operations at the Sunoco station in Tacony.
- **Short-Range Precognition** - Can perceive up to five seconds into the future, granting her a significant advantage in combat and tactical situations. She displayed momentary precognitive awareness during the Dobson Mills warehouse stakeout and uses this ability in conjunction with her martial arts training to anticipate and counter attacks.
- **Precognition Chaining** - Can extend her precognitive window indefinitely by "chaining" successive five-second glimpses into a continuous vision of the future. However, this locks her physically to the area where the chaining began; she cannot leave until the predicted timeframe has passed, as departing would create causality issues. She is physically unable to move from the location during this process.
- **Photographic Memory** - Possesses total recall, which enhances both her investigative capabilities and her ability to provide detailed intelligence. This ability allowed her to produce an accurate sketch of Aaron McKinley from her psychometric vision, which was subsequently broadcast on the news and confirmed Aaron's identity.

### Limitations

- Lucy's powers are perception-based and provide no physical enhancements; she is a baseline human in terms of durability, strength, and recovery.
- Psychometry is limited to a 24-hour window and requires her physical presence at the location she wishes to read.
- Precognition chaining, while theoretically indefinite, renders her immobile and vulnerable for the duration of the predicted timeframe.
- She was injured during the Dobson Mills warehouse battle, requiring Bubble's protective force fields and Sam's direct intervention to keep her safe.

### Training & Skills

- Highly skilled martial artist who combines joint locks and grappling techniques with her precognitive awareness for an extremely effective close-combat fighting style.
- Accomplished illustrator capable of producing accurate sketches from psychometric visions - her drawing of Aaron McKinley was used for identification on news broadcasts (Ch. 140).
- Experienced investigator who regularly assists police and the Delaware Valley Defenders, leveraging her psychometry to reconstruct crime scenes.
- Competent team leader and multi-team strategic coordinator across Philadelphia's vigilante community.

## Personality

Lucy is pragmatic, professional, and methodical. She maintains a calm, formal demeanor under pressure and speaks with a directness that conveys authority without aggression. Her perfectionist streak manifests in thorough preparation and a preference for evidence-gathering over impulsive action. She is emotionally reserved and channels commitment through careful planning rather than passion.

Beneath her composed exterior lies a sharp wit and willingness to make blunt assessments - she dismissively nicknamed Miss Mayfly "Mosquito" and warned Team Mayfly plainly about the inevitability of injuries in unpowered field operations. She is deeply committed to the safety of the broader vigilante community, proposing inter-team coordination and mutual protection in response to the Argus Corps' anti-vigilante initiatives. Her leadership style prioritizes defensive, community-oriented operations - food distribution, neighborhood patrols, search-and-rescue - in contrast to the Auditors' more aggressive approach.

## Relationships

- The Tacony Titans operate out of a garage headquarters, in contrast to the Auditors' Music Hall and later Community Center.
- Sundial has become something of an internet personality on HIRC (a Philly metahuman gossip forum), with "Sundial memes" among the topics of discussion.
- Her costume features a distinctive sundial pendant, a white gi-style outfit with padded armor, and a visor-mask.
