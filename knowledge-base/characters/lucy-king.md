## Background

Lucy King is a mixed Blasian metahuman who grew up in Tacony, a neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia, within a middle-class family with high expectations. She operates under the alias Sundial and leads the Tacony Titans, a team of young heroes who serve as the defensive, community-oriented counterpart to the Auditors in the Northeast Philadelphia vigilante ecosystem. Prior to her on-page introduction, the Tacony Titans had already established enough of a local presence to maintain a basic website listing their members, which Sam Small's school friends discovered during an online search in September 2023.

Lucy and the Titans first appeared in person in late April 2024, when Sam Small and Jordan Westwood encountered Sundial and Bubble intervening in a drunken dispute at Wissinoming Park during one of Sam's first patrols after her hospitalization. Sundial demonstrated immediate competence, neutralizing the threat with an aikido technique before formal introductions revealed the team's name. She suggested that future collaboration between their groups could be "mutually beneficial," establishing the cautious, professional tone that would define her relationship with the Auditors going forward.

Lucy's role expanded significantly when she approached Sam after the failed sting operation on Squeal in early May 2024, proposing a formal alliance between the Titans and the Auditors to address the growing drug crisis in Philadelphia. This alliance proved critical in subsequent operations against the Jump distribution network and remained a cornerstone of the Northeast Philadelphia vigilante infrastructure through subsequent arcs. Lucy balances her leadership of the Titans with independent investigative work, often assisting the Delaware Valley Defenders and local law enforcement with cases that benefit from her psychometric abilities.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Psychometry** — Lucy can "read" locations by experiencing events that occurred there up to 24 hours in the past. This manifests as a sensory movie, allowing her to witness past actions in detail sufficient to identify individuals, describe their behavior, and reconstruct timelines. She used this ability to confirm Aaron McKinley as the arsonist behind the Philadelphia fire crisis by reading the burned coffee shop site, and to investigate Jump distribution operations at the Sunoco station in Tacony.
- **Short-Range Precognition** — Can perceive up to five seconds into the future, granting her a significant advantage in combat and tactical situations. She displayed momentary precognitive awareness during the Dobson Mills warehouse stakeout and uses this ability in conjunction with her martial arts training to anticipate and counter attacks.
- **Precognition Chaining** — Can extend her precognitive window indefinitely by "chaining" successive five-second glimpses into a continuous vision of the future. However, this locks her physically to the area where the chaining began; she cannot leave until the predicted timeframe has passed, as departing would create causality issues. She is physically unable to move from the location during this process.
- **Photographic Memory** — Possesses total recall, which enhances both her investigative capabilities and her ability to provide detailed intelligence. This ability allowed her to produce an accurate sketch of Aaron McKinley from her psychometric vision, which was subsequently broadcast on the news and confirmed Aaron's identity.

### Limitations

- Lucy's powers are perception-based and provide no physical enhancements; she is a baseline human in terms of durability, strength, and recovery.
- Psychometry is limited to a 24-hour window and requires her physical presence at the location she wishes to read.
- Precognition chaining, while theoretically indefinite, renders her immobile and vulnerable for the duration of the predicted timeframe.
- She was injured during the Dobson Mills warehouse battle, requiring Bubble's protective force fields and Sam's direct intervention to keep her safe.

### Training & Skills

- Highly skilled aikido practitioner who combines her martial art with precognitive awareness to create an extremely effective close-combat fighting style. She neutralized a threat at Wissinoming Park with a single technique during her first on-page appearance and demonstrated skilled combat against armed opponents at the Sunoco station confrontation.
- Accomplished illustrator, capable of producing accurate sketches from her psychometric visions. Her drawing of Aaron McKinley was detailed enough to be used as an identification tool on news broadcasts.
- Experienced investigator who regularly assists the Delaware Valley Defenders and local police with cases, leveraging her psychometry to reconstruct crime scenes and identify perpetrators.
- Competent team leader and strategic coordinator, managing the Tacony Titans' operations and facilitating multi-team alliances across Philadelphia's vigilante community.

## Personality

Lucy is pragmatic, professional, and methodical in her approach to both leadership and fieldwork. She maintains a calm, formal demeanor under pressure and speaks with a directness that conveys authority without aggression. Her perfectionist streak manifests in thorough preparation and a preference for evidence-gathering over impulsive action. She is emotionally reserved, rarely displaying vulnerability even when situations deteriorate, and channels her commitment to the Titans' mission through careful planning rather than overt displays of passion.

Beneath her composed exterior, Lucy possesses a sharp wit and a willingness to make blunt assessments. She dismissively referred to Miss Mayfly as "Mosquito" during the post-Ricochet confrontation, made casual inquiries about Crossroads' personal life in the same scene, and warned Team Mayfly plainly about the inevitability of injuries if they continued field operations without powers. She is deeply committed to the safety of her teammates and the broader vigilante community, proposing inter-team coordination and mutual protection strategies in response to the Argus Corps' anti-vigilante initiatives. Her leadership style prioritizes defensive, reactive operations -- the Titans are described as "the boy scouts of Tacony" -- in contrast to the Auditors' more aggressive approach, a distinction she has noted directly when referencing Sam's violence-oriented methods.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Ally / Fellow Leader | Leader-to-leader relationship built on mutual respect and strategic cooperation.

She has commented on Sam's tendency toward violence but maintains a productive working relationship. |
| Joshua Clark (Sandman) | Teammate / Second-in-Command | The Titans' second-in-command. Sandman provided covert surveillance of Sam's neighborhood during the arson crisis and serves as the team's night watchman and tactical planner. |

| Maxwell Martinez (Crossroads) | Professional Contact | Leader of the Young Defenders.

Crossroads instructed her and Moonshot to return to patrol after the battle. |
| Kate Smith (Miss Mayfly) | Acquaintance | Lucy dismissively nicknamed her "Mosquito" and warned about the dangers of unpowered individuals participating in field operations. The Titans helped devise a cover story to protect Kate's identity after the Dobson Mills battle. |

## Trivia

- The Tacony Titans operated a basic website listing their members before any on-page appearance, discovered by Sam's friends in September 2023. The original roster listed on the site included Bubble, Compass, Weave, Sandman, and Sundial -- Weave was later apparently replaced by Moonshot on the team.
- Lucy dismissively referred to Miss Mayfly as "Mosquito," a nickname that stuck among the Titans, with Bubble also expressing dislike for the "mosquito" prior to Kate's identity being known.
- Sam used the mere threat of Sundial's psychometry to talk Marathon out of bombing the Bellwether drug operation, marking the first tactical use of the Titans' powers as leverage without Lucy even being present.
- When Sam sent out the Bellwether intelligence message to all her contacts, Sundial was the first to respond, replying simply with "When and where?"
- Lucy's current status as of the beginning of Arc 16 is listed as "N/A, presumably working and handling school," making her one of the few characters whose civilian life remains largely undetailed.
- The Tacony Titans operate out of a garage headquarters, in contrast to the Auditors' Music Hall and later Community Center.
- Lucy's fighting style -- aikido combined with precognition -- makes her one of the most technically skilled martial artists in the story, capable of neutralizing threats with minimal force.
