??? warning "Background"

    Maria Valdez is the lead silent assassin for the Philadelphia branch of the Kingdom of Keys, a criminal organization that dominates the Northeast's underworld. Before joining the Kingdom, she worked as a nurse, a career that gave her an intimate understanding of human physiology and, in particular, the cardiovascular system. She was recruited directly out of nursing to help found the Kingdom, making her one of the organization's original members rather than a later addition. Her medical background also makes her one of the few proper medics within the Kingdom's ranks.

    Valdez is a transgender woman whose transition was met with acceptance from her family, and her wider community was largely indifferent. She did not become a criminal as a result of institutional discrimination or persecution. While she experienced individual incidents of bullying and abuse, she resolved those situations through physical confrontation, beating the people who targeted her. Her path into organized crime was driven by more pragmatic motivations: the money was seductive, and the work made her feel competent and respected in a way her previous career did not.

??? note "Powers & Abilities"

    **PERKS Assessment**

    No official PERKS assessment on file.

    **Abilities**

    - **Cardiac Rhythm Manipulation** - Through direct skin-to-skin contact, Valdez can accelerate or decelerate a target's heart rate. She can push a heartbeat up to approximately 300 BPM or bring it down to 0 BPM (full cardiac arrest), at a rate of roughly 4 to 5 beats per second in either direction, depending on situational factors. The mechanism is musculo-convulsive rather than nervous, psychological, or neurotoxic; she applies a direct convulsive force to the heart muscle itself.
    - **Self-Application** - Valdez can use her cardiac manipulation on herself, allowing her to regulate her own heart rate for tactical purposes such as calming herself under stress or increasing her own circulatory output.
    - **Biological Sedation** - During the zoo heist, Valdez used her powers to sedate poison dart frogs by decelerating their heartbeats, demonstrating that her ability functions on non-human organisms as well.

    **Limitations**

    - Requires direct skin-to-skin contact to activate her power; the ability cannot be used at range or through barriers such as clothing or armor.
    - The rate of change is limited to approximately 4-5 BPM per second, meaning a kill via cardiac arrest from a normal resting heart rate takes a measurable amount of time rather than being instantaneous.
    - Specific upper limits on how long she must maintain contact to achieve lethal effect, or whether her power is affected by the target's physiology (size, fitness, metahuman resilience), are not documented.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Highly skilled with knives, including butterfly knives; described as fascinated with and extremely proficient in bladed combat. Carried a butterfly knife and used it to inflict accumulated cuts targeting mobility during her fight with Crossroads.
    - Trained in pankration, a traditional Greek martial art combining wrestling and striking.
    - Competent with firearms, though less proficient than with knives. Employed a suppressed pistol during the assassination attempt on Crossroads, firing with accuracy under combat conditions.
    - Former nurse with medical knowledge that informs both her killing methods and her role as a Kingdom field medic.
    - Proficient in lockpicking or key acquisition, as she entered Crossroads's apartment with a key or lockpick during the assassination attempt.

??? warning "Personality"

    Valdez is quiet, professional, and thoroughly no-nonsense while on the job. She does not joke, does not socialize, and does not engage in anything beyond what the mission requires. This is not an absence of personality but a deliberate compartmentalization; she does have a lighter side, but it only emerges in rare off-duty moments. As the character reference guide notes, her hair is only seen down at Christmas parties and after a big heist. She is on the job a great deal of the time.

    In the field, Valdez is clinical and efficient. During the Crossroads assassination, her only spoken words in real time were "Mother fucker" upon failing to complete the kill, and even her emotional responses were largely suppressed. Her anger at Crossroads for texting Sam mid-fight, appearing to not take the confrontation seriously, was notable precisely because it was one of the few emotions she displayed. She approaches assassination as a technical problem, calculating whether a target will bleed out quickly enough and adjusting her tactics accordingly. Her preferred method of silent killing, strangling a target while simultaneously inducing bradycardia, reflects a practitioner who has refined murder into a discipline.

??? warning "Relationships"

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First appears in Chapter 25 as the unnamed "woman in red" at the Crescent nightclub VIP section alongside Mrs. Xenograft and Mr. Tyrannosaur. Identified as "Mrs. H" and later "Mrs. Heartstopper" (an early alias). Takes control of the situation after Sam and Jordan's cover is blown, uses her power to slow Sam's heartbeat dangerously via bradycardia, and mentions the Kingdom's code of conduct forbidding harm to minors. Sam spits blood on her ankle to create a tracker. Sam performs a wrestling move on her during the escape. Referenced in the post-mission debrief as one of three identified Kingdom operatives.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appears at the docks during "Operation Ivory" preparations, checking on the operation's progress when Devonte (Playback) is caught eavesdropping. Later appears in the Reptile House during the Philadelphia Zoo heist, using her powers to sedate poison dart frogs while a captive zookeeper identifies which ones are wild-caught. Escapes with frog containers after threatening the zookeeper, making her the only Kingdom operative present to avoid capture during the zoo battle, while Mr. Nothing and Mudslide are apprehended.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Interlude

    Featured in Interlude MaM.1 as the primary antagonist. Dispatched by the Kingdom to assassinate Crossroads at his apartment in a coordinated attack timed alongside Maya's Alice operation. Enters with a lockpick and suppressed pistol, fires immediately with no negotiation. Engages in a brutal four-minute fight involving gunfire (five shots, three hitting Crossroads), butterfly knife combat, and close-quarters grappling. Crossroads breaks two to three of her fingers taking her gun and smashes her hand during the struggle. Escapes through a shattered window as sirens approach, having failed to kill Crossroads but inflicting severe injuries (multiple gunshot wounds, stab wounds). Her words in a precognition branch confirm the motive: "This is because of Sam Small."

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as the attacker who shot and stabbed Crossroads, who is now recovering at the Small family home. Her attack is cited as evidence that the Kingdom knows more about Sam's network than expected, possibly through Mr. ESP's intelligence. Valdez herself is recovering from her injuries (smashed hand, sprained wrists) and working on smaller hits targeting Rogue Wave operations.


??? warning "Trivia"

    - Valdez was initially identified in the story as "Mrs. Heartstopper" and "Mrs. H" before her codename was established as "Mrs. Heartbeat," reflecting the Kingdom's alphabetical naming convention where each member corresponds to a letter (H for Heartbeat).
    - She is one of the few Kingdom operatives to have encountered Sam Small in person and escaped without being captured or identified by name during the encounter.
    - Her preferred assassination technique of combining strangulation with bradycardia represents a synthesis of her medical knowledge and her metahuman ability, designed to kill silently and leave minimal forensic evidence of power use.
    - During the Crossroads fight, she demonstrated second-order game theory, attempting to predict the predictions of a precognitive, and shot a coin out of the air when Crossroads flipped it as a distraction.
    - Her only words spoken in real time during the Crossroads assassination attempt were "Mother fucker" upon failing to complete the kill.
    - The character reference guide specifies that her powers are musculo-convulsive rather than nervous, psychological, or neurotoxic, a distinction that places her ability in the Adjust category of PERKS classification, targeting physical systems through touch.
    - She is one of the Kingdom's founding members, having been recruited directly from her nursing career, which makes her one of the longest-serving operatives in the organization.
