## Background

Maria Valdez is the lead silent assassin for the Philadelphia branch of the Kingdom of Keys, a criminal organization that dominates the Northeast's underworld. Before joining the Kingdom, she worked as a nurse, a career that gave her an intimate understanding of human physiology and, in particular, the cardiovascular system. She was recruited directly out of nursing to help found the Kingdom, making her one of the organization's original members rather than a later addition. Her medical background also makes her one of the few proper medics within the Kingdom's ranks.

Valdez is a transgender woman whose transition was met with acceptance from her family, and her wider community was largely indifferent. She did not become a criminal as a result of institutional discrimination or persecution. While she experienced individual incidents of bullying and abuse, she resolved those situations through physical confrontation, beating the people who targeted her. Her path into organized crime was driven by more pragmatic motivations: the money was seductive, and the work made her feel competent and respected in a way her previous career did not.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Cardiac Rhythm Manipulation** - Through direct skin-to-skin contact, Valdez can accelerate or decelerate a target's heart rate. She can push a heartbeat up to approximately 300 BPM or bring it down to 0 BPM (full cardiac arrest), at a rate of roughly 4 to 5 beats per second in either direction, depending on situational factors. The mechanism is musculo-convulsive rather than nervous, psychological, or neurotoxic; she applies a direct convulsive force to the heart muscle itself.
- **Self-Application** - Valdez can use her cardiac manipulation on herself, allowing her to regulate her own heart rate for tactical purposes such as calming herself under stress or increasing her own circulatory output.
- **Biological Sedation** - During the zoo heist, Valdez used her powers to sedate poison dart frogs by decelerating their heartbeats, demonstrating that her ability functions on non-human organisms as well.

### Limitations

- Requires direct skin-to-skin contact; cannot be used at range or through clothing/armor. Wears palmless gloves to maintain readiness.
- Rate of change limited to approximately 4-5 BPM per second, so cardiac arrest from resting heart rate takes measurable time rather than being instantaneous.
- Effects of target physiology (size, fitness, metahuman resilience) on her power are not documented.

### Training & Skills

- Highly skilled with knives, especially butterfly knives; described as fascinated with and extremely proficient in bladed combat.
- Trained in pankration, a Greek martial art combining wrestling and striking.
- Competent with firearms, though less proficient than with knives.
- Medical knowledge from nursing career informs both her killing methods and her role as a Kingdom field medic.
- Carries a glass-breaking hammer as a backup weapon and breaching tool.

## Personality

Valdez is quiet, professional, and thoroughly no-nonsense while on the job. She does not joke, does not socialize, and does not engage in anything beyond what the mission requires. This is not an absence of personality but deliberate compartmentalization - she does have a lighter side, but it only emerges in rare off-duty moments. Her hair is only seen down at Christmas parties and after a big heist.

In the field, she is clinical and efficient, approaching assassination as a technical problem. Her preferred method of silent killing - strangling a target while simultaneously inducing bradycardia - reflects a practitioner who has refined murder into a discipline. Emotional displays are exceedingly rare; anger at Crossroads pulling out his phone mid-fight was notable precisely because it was so unusual for her.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First appears in Chapter 25 as the unnamed "woman in red" at the Crescent nightclub VIP section alongside Mrs. Xenograft and Mr. Tyrannosaur. Identified as "Mrs. H" and recognized as the clear authority figure among the three, silencing the others with a single arm gesture. Extremely perceptive - catches Sam and Jordan's sneakers and UV minor stamps on their hands. In Chapter 26, uses her power to induce bradycardia on Sam through neck contact, risking brain damage. Can recite the Kingdom Code of Conduct from memory, citing rules forbidding recruitment of minors. Sam fights back by yanking out a loose tooth to throw as a distraction, wrapping waiter pants around Heartbeat's throat, and landing an elbow drop on her stomach. Sam hawks bloody saliva at her ankle as a tracker before escaping. Not fooled by Jordan's fake black hole gun bluff, unlike Mr. Tyrannosaur and Mrs. Xenograft. New to Young Defenders intelligence at this point. Referenced in the post-mission debrief as one of three identified Kingdom operatives.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Minor

    Appears in Chapters 40-41 at a Kingdom warehouse meeting alongside Mr. Polygraph, referred to as "Mrs. Heartstopper" in Sam's narration. Serves as a silent sentinel at the entrance, dressed all in red with stilettos, hoop earrings, long hair, and fingerless gloves. Does not speak during the meeting but her presence carries clear authority and intimidation. Witnesses Polygraph execute a man who failed a lie detection test without any visible reaction. Jordan captures video footage of both Heartbeat and Polygraph that is later presented at a Young Defenders debriefing.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appears in Interlude dh-2 (Devonte Harris's POV) arriving at the docks in a black SUV to oversee Operation Ivory preparations. Commands the operation with cold authority, referencing upper management's expectations. Present when Devonte is discovered eavesdropping; Devonte uses his sound powers to blast captured engine noise directly at her face as a distraction during his and Akilah's escape. Later appears in Chapter 134 in the Reptile House during the Philadelphia Zoo heist, using her powers to sedate poison dart frogs by touch while a captive zookeeper identifies which ones are wild-caught. Escapes with frog containers after threatening to kill the zookeeper, making her the only Kingdom operative present to avoid capture during the zoo battle, while Mr. Nothing and Mudslide are apprehended.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Named in Interlude mr-8 (Maya Richardson's POV) as part of a planned extraction team for Deathgirl from Daedalus, alongside a "Mrs. Synapse." Mr. Antithesis assigns both Heartbeat and Synapse to the operation, anticipating that Deathgirl may resist extraction if she has acclimated to therapy.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Interlude

    Featured in Interlude mam-1 (Maxwell Martinez's POV) as the primary antagonist. Dispatched by the Kingdom to assassinate Crossroads at his apartment in a coordinated attack timed alongside Maya's Alice operation. Enters smoothly with a key or equivalent and a suppressed pistol already drawn, fires immediately with no negotiation. Engages in a brutal four-minute fight involving gunfire (five shots total - three hitting Crossroads, one shooting a flipped coin out of the air, one destroying his phone), butterfly knife combat, and close-quarters grappling. Crossroads breaks two to three of her fingers wrenching the gun away, but she transitions to her butterfly knife without any visible reaction to the injury. Uses low-velocity rounds with a suppressor. Also employs a glass-breaking hammer as a final weapon to create space for her escape. Escapes through the window as sirens approach, having failed to kill Crossroads but inflicting severe injuries (multiple gunshot wounds, stab wounds). In a precognition branch, her words confirm the motive: "This is because of Sam Small."

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in Chapter 242 as the attacker who nearly killed Crossroads, who has been recovering on the Small family couch for two to three months since the attack. Crossroads eventually leaves with his shoulder at 80-85% to finish physical therapy from his dorm.


## Trivia

- Initially identified in-story as "Mrs. Heartstopper" and "Mrs. H" before her codename was established as "Mrs. Heartbeat," reflecting the Kingdom's alphabetical naming convention.
- One of the few Kingdom operatives to have encountered Sam Small in person and escaped without being captured or identified by name.
- During the Crossroads fight, demonstrated second-order game theory - attempting to predict the predictions of a precognitive - and shot a flipped coin out of the air.
