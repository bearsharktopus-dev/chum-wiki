## Background

Derek Taylor was born in Boston to Finn Taylor, a low-level Irish mob associate. In 2002, motivated by a chance encounter with a masked vigilante and a desire to give his young son a better life, Finn fled Boston for Philadelphia on the advice of his friend Mikey Flanagan. Derek grew up in the city and at some point developed werewolf abilities - an involuntary transformation into a wolf-like form at sundown every night. Unable to control the change, he adopted a grim routine of self-tranquilization with ketamine and locking himself into a reinforced cage in his bedroom, a nightly imprisonment that lasted approximately seven years and cut him off from normal social life. He also accumulated a petty criminal record during this period.

Derek met Sam Small in a trauma support group for superhumans led by Dr. Jensen in the spring of 2024, where his hostile demeanor was the first thing to break through Sam's lithium-induced emotional flatness. After tracking Sam by scent and recognizing her as Bloodhound, Derek approached her for help stopping his friend Elias Franklin, who had taken the drug Fly and transformed into the chimeric villain "Chimera." This collaboration marked Derek's entry into the vigilante world and his gradual integration into Sam's network.

In late October 2025, following Sam's retirement from the Bloodhound identity, Derek enrolled in the NSRA's experimental Vysera (daxerimab) trial - a metabolic suppressant that suppresses his transformation for 3-4 hours per dose (14 doses per week, two per day). Power suppression is absolute, including his daytime enhanced smell. He was one of 37 participants nationwide, fitted with a tamper-proof monitoring bracelet tracking biometrics and GPS. Side effects include dizziness, nausea, injection site soreness, surface-level cysts, and rare dissociative episodes. On his first dose, Derek watched sunset pass without transforming, then walked the Philadelphia streets after dark for the first time in seven years. He received the modified Bloodhound costume from Amelia (Gossamer) on Halloween morning and officially became Bloodhound II, conducting private investigation work and night patrols while Sam shifted to EMT work and mentorship.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Involuntary Werewolf Transformation** - Transforms into a wolf-like form at sundown each night. The transformation is entirely involuntary and has occurred nightly for approximately seven years. In wolf form, Derek possesses enhanced strength and speed. His wolf form has bright red fur (darker and purer red than his orange-red human hair), a bulky oversized upper body, huge claws, and pupilless eyes. He moves with a gorilla-like loping gait, throwing himself across the ground with his front paws while his legs serve a secondary role. In this form he loses higher cognitive function and doorknob dexterity but gains devastating physical power.
- **Enhanced Sense of Smell (Daytime)** - Even in human form, Derek possesses a heightened sense of smell that functions during daylight hours. This makes him a particularly effective tracker, capable of following scent trails through urban environments, identifying individuals by smell, and detecting specific odors such as ozone.
- **Injury Reset on Transformation** - Injuries sustained in one form vanish when Derek changes between human and wolf forms. This effective regeneration occurs at each transformation, meaning wounds accumulated during the day heal when he transforms at sunset, and vice versa. This includes broken bones - his nose has been broken twelve or more times in human form, resets to peak condition in wolf form each night, then re-breaks whenever he wakes up human.
- **Enhanced Senses (Wolf Form)** - In wolf form, all senses are significantly heightened beyond their already enhanced daytime levels.

### Limitations

- **No Transformation Control** - Derek cannot choose when to transform. The change occurs involuntarily at sundown every night, requiring him to secure himself beforehand.
- **Nightly Incapacitation** - Without Vysera, Derek is effectively incapacitated every night, forced to tranquilize himself and lock himself in a cage to prevent harm.
- **Vysera Time Limit** - The experimental drug Vysera suppresses his transformation for only 3-4 hours per dose, creating a strict operational window after dark. He receives 14 doses per week (two per day). Power suppression is absolute - it also eliminates his enhanced daytime smell for the duration, meaning he must choose between nighttime freedom and his primary investigative tool.
- **Sunset Deadline** - All daytime operations must conclude before sunset, or Derek risks transforming in an uncontrolled environment. This creates constant time pressure during missions.
- **NSRA Monitoring** - While on the Vysera trial, Derek wears a monitoring bracelet that tracks his location and biometrics. Agent Jennings has warned him against vigilante activities based on suspicious readings.

### Training & Skills

- Skilled street fighter with experience using brass knuckles and a switchblade in close combat.
- Experienced tracker who combines his enhanced sense of smell with investigative methodology, conducting private investigations including missing persons cases.
- Possesses street-level intelligence networks and criminal contacts from his background.
- Competent at undercover work and bluffing, as demonstrated during the Sparkplug infiltration and his private investigation work in Fishtown.

## Personality

Derek is gruff, antisocial, and bluntly practical, with a deep cynicism born from years of nightly imprisonment. He speaks with little regard for social niceties, maintains emotional distance from almost everyone, and carries himself with the wariness of someone accustomed to operating alone.

Beneath the abrasive exterior, Derek demonstrates genuine loyalty and self-sacrifice - he held a switchblade to his own throat to save Sam during the Chimera confrontation. He is reliable when it counts, even if he resists being seen that way. His assumption of the Bloodhound identity reveals a desire for purpose and connection he would likely never articulate. His approach to the role is more methodical than Sam's, with greater command presence but less familiarity with emergency protocols. He shows no interest in ceremony or public perception: when a Cape Watch blogger confirmed his identity, his response was characteristically dismissive - "People who need to know, know."

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Introduced in Chapter 66 as a confrontational member of Sam's trauma support group - bright orange hair, freckles, leather trenchcoat with patches. Dismissive of others' sharing, offering only snarky quips like "I don't do hobbies." Leaves thirty minutes early every session without explanation, a pattern Dr. Jensen tolerates. Sam nearly confronts him when he leaves but backs down after his confused "Huh?" leaves her embarrassed. His hostile demeanor is the first thing to break through Sam's lithium-induced emotional numbness, sparking genuine anger that she describes as the first feeling to come back to life in her head.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Tracks Sam by her blood scent after a support group session and reveals his werewolf nature, asking for help stopping his friend Elias (Chimera) from attacking Independence Blue Cross. Arrives at the IBC building wearing Sam's old wolf mask as a hand-me-down (replacing his own ski mask, which Sam vetoed), adopting the codename "Fenrir" on the spot. Sam and Derek confront Chimera together on the seventh floor - Derek fights with brass knuckles and a switchblade, getting his nose shattered by Elias's fox-muzzle headbutt. When Elias chokes Sam with a bear paw, Derek holds a switchblade to his own throat to force Elias to release her, gambling on their friendship. Elias reveals his supplier (a bald white man with lightning powers) before escaping by shapeshifting into a deer and crashing through a seventh-story window. Derek and Sam limp out leaning on each other. Joins Sam's investigative team alongside Jordan and Spindle, working his Kensington criminal contacts (an ex-Irish mob contact in a dingy bar) to identify Sparkplug and his dealer Squeal. Sets up a $60,000 buy from Squeal using Monopoly money in a duffel bag, negotiating the deal over the phone and using fear of the "Big Bad Wolf of Kensington" as leverage. During the Dobson Mills warehouse battle, arrives in werewolf form with Sandman riding on his back like a jockey - having pre-tranquilized himself as a workaround so Sandman could control his sleeping wolf form. Together they take down Squeal: Derek slaps him across the chest with his claws while Spindle gags him. Later uses enhanced smell to locate Sparkplug's specific unit (3028) in the Dorchester high-rise by tracking ozone, burnt rubber, and body odor through 32 floors. Participates in the Sparkplug takedown, posing as a delivery man at the door and stalling until sunset triggers his transformation, at which point he bursts through the door in werewolf form while Moonshot simultaneously inserts Sam through the weakened window. Takes a lightning bolt during the fight, convulses, and collapses but survives. Sparkplug carves into him with an electrified knife before Fenrir swats him through a wall. Sam uses a backup sedative syringe to safely put werewolf Derek down after the fight, and he is returned to his cage at home.

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Co-creates the anonymous whistleblower website with Sam, Jordan, and Spindle in Chapter 105, contributing the core concept based on a complaint box from an old job - "a little wooden box nailed to the manager's door" - which Sam adapts into a digital platform. Uses his enhanced sense of smell to track Pattinson's Pals members during the team's surveillance operations. Goes through Egalitarian's trash, finding a receipt from the night of a charity gala (proving Egalitarian lied about their whereabouts), thrown-away speeding tickets, and public citations. Present at the Music Hall planning session where Sam reveals the recorded audio of Patriot's warehouse meeting, helping compile the surveillance evidence package that Jordan schedules for automatic upload during the homecoming dance. Part of the proto-Auditors group operating from the Tacony Music Hall.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Interlude

    Featured in Interlude DT.1, told from his father Finn's perspective in 2002 Boston. Finn and fellow mobsters watch news of Windstorm at The Clover & Harp bar. Finn attends a meeting with boss Callahan and a secret breakaway meeting with Sean, interrupted by Russian mobsters. A masked vigilante defeats the Russians and warns the group. Mikey Flanagan advises Finn to leave Boston. Finn takes young Derek for ice cream while contemplating his future, then drives out of Boston, spotting a costumed figure swinging between buildings. Present at the Crescent nightclub planning session at Music Hall but sits out the undercover operation itself ("Werewolf at a night club. Not exactly a good time."). During the CPS home visit for Connor's adoption, Derek helps clean the Music Hall - dusting banisters and maintaining the cover story, claiming a book on espionage tradecraft belongs to him as an "aspiring spy novelist." When CPS agent Anna Katz comments that none of the group looks over eighteen, Derek protests: "I'm twenty four!" He reveals he doesn't know his mother and saw foster kids get split up in his old neighborhood. Participates in team discussions about the Kingdom and Rogue Wave, suggesting broadcasting "Rogue Wave" as a trigger phrase to identify compromised people (which Sam vetoes) and proposing hacking police radio (which Jordan shuts down as "not how hacking works").

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Teams up with Sam to track Aaron McKinley during the arson spree using his enhanced sense of smell. Sam messages Derek at midnight; he replies at dawn complaining about being in North Philly. Meeting at a condemned thrift store, Derek identifies the scent on Aaron's threatening envelope - nail polish remover (acetone), road flares, and sweat - and traces it to Happy Nails & Spa, where a young woman confirms Aaron got a manicure and bought a gift card the previous week. Tracking the scent for several hours through Tacony, Derek reveals Aaron's extensive and methodical surveillance patterns: heavy concentration at Sam's school's side entrances and staff parking lot across multiple visits, past the park, the corner deli, and the Music Hall (where Aaron had doubled back more than once, most recently the day before). The trail leads east to the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge, where Derek determines the scent is minutes old. With approximately forty minutes before his werewolf transformation, Derek and Sam approach Aaron's faded red Camry in the construction site under the bridge. Derek smashes the windshield with a brick and boot-kicks Aaron off Sam when he has her pinned. Aaron's yellow flames lick up Derek's sleeve, and later Aaron sprays yellow fire across Derek's chest through a gap in smoke. Sam puts Fury Forge's oxygen mask on Derek. Both injured and exhausted, Derek takes a taxi home before his werewolf transformation with approximately twenty minutes to spare. His tracking also reveals that Aaron has been visiting the Music Hall area, which the team uses for subsequent planning.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Unavailable due to werewolf issues.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Absent for weeks while searching for Elias (no luck - possibly dead or having left Philadelphia). Shows up for Jordan's going-away party at the Music Hall.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Texts Sam that Elias visited his apartment. At Derek's South Philly apartment, he explains that he nicked Elias with a pocket knife to obtain a blood sample - orange and Fly-altered. Sam uses the blood trail to track Elias across the city through Point Breeze to a warehouse near South Street, where Elias is revealed to be working as a Rogue Wave researcher documenting Jump effects. Present during the chaos that follows Monkey Business's emergency alert system hack announcing a citywide Jump scavenger hunt.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Recruited to impersonate Bloodhound in order to draw out the serial killer Shrike, still possessing a spare costume from the Sparkplug operation. Agrees to a four-hour window starting at noon, with a hard deadline before sunset due to his werewolf transformation. Gets a taxi for free when the driver recognizes his costume ("Don't worry about the meter, Bloodhound"). Investigates Shrike's elaborate art installation at Ascension of Our Lord church in Kensington - twelve or more mannequins impaled on black metal spikes, posed lewdly and splashed with red paint, carved with street names and numbers forming a deconstructed address puzzle. Searches Shrike's clue locations under a strict sunset deadline. Goes home around 6 PM.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Major

    Arrives at the Music Hall at 7:15 AM post-wolf transformation (sweatpants, stained t-shirt, bloodshot eyes, dark circles) after Sam's family evacuates to the Auditors' base following Shrike's bedroom invasion. Sam privately asks Derek to help contact Elias (Chimera) to reach Monkey Business and Rogue Wave, wanting to cash in Rush Order's public declaration of Ben being under Rogue Wave protection. Derek reluctantly agrees to think about it, then hands Sam his phone so she can compose a voicemail to Elias - whose contact photo shows a grinning kid with a puffed-up afro giving a thumbs-up. Derek wanted to say "I miss him" but denied it. Goes with Ben to pick up essentials and leaves at sunset for his wolf transformation. Featured in Interludes DT.2 and DT.3. DT.2 follows Derek's enrollment in the NSRA's Vysera trial after three months of screening: first injection at 5:05 PM, watches enhanced smell fade by 5:35, sunset at 6:08 passes without transformation while he waits inside his cage as a precaution. First nighttime outing in seven years - dinner with father Finn at Vincenzo's, then walking the streets and seeing stars. Rescues missing college student Gina Martinez (19) from an underground Fishtown club where she was being given Jump by a man named Leon, using a spray-painted toy gun to bluff his way out. Agent Jennings confronts him about irregular dosing patterns and suspicious biometric readings at his weekly check-in. Receives the modified Bloodhound costume (summer and winter variations, Kevlar) and Sam's old gear from Amelia behind a Northeast Philly high school on Halloween morning, officially becoming Bloodhound II. By November (Chapter 211), Derek has been on Vysera for three weeks without a wolf transformation, with side effects of fatigue, joint pain, and emotional flatness, managed clinically through Dr. Vasquez. He is conflicted about the suppression - feeling relief at his freedom but also a loss of identity. Sam watches news footage of Derek as the new Bloodhound at a telekinetic Activation incident in Germantown, noting he moves more cautiously and deliberately than she did. DT.3 documents the public discovery: Cape Watch Philly blogger Alicia C. publishes speculation at 10:47 AM on November 4 based on eyewitness reports (broader build, redesigned costume, different movement patterns, more command presence, different voice distorter described as "more androgynous"), then tracks Derek to a South Philly vacant lot where he confirms the identity change at 1:23 AM on November 5. Handles night patrol and investigations while Sam focuses on EMT work and mentorship.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Operates as Bloodhound II. By this point, Derek uses Vysera selectively, approximately 3-4 times per week for a few hours each time rather than daily. His existence as a separate Bloodhound is noted in the investigation when evidence reveals three Bloodhounds operating simultaneously: the retired Sam, Derek as Bloodhound II, and a shapeshifter impersonator.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Shows up as Bloodhound II at the Tacony Community Center grand opening, providing backup alongside Sam (who wears her repaired Bloodhound costume for the appearance). The sight of two Bloodhounds together intimidates Songbirds protesters into leaving. Assists Sam's network by helping run a DMV plate search while in the Bloodhound costume, using Liberty Belle's old contacts to identify a gray Honda Civic supply car linked to Kingdom drug operations. Included in Sam's intelligence distribution about the Bellwether District drug operation alongside other Auditors members, Councilman Davis, Sundial, and Miasma.


## Trivia

- His temporary alias "Fenrir" was adopted on the spot during the Chimera confrontation - Sam introduced him as "my provisional member, uh-" and Derek immediately supplied "Fenrir," referencing the giant wolf of Norse mythology.
- His werewolf form built a street reputation as the "Big Bad Wolf of Kensington," paralleling Sam's "Big Bad Wolf of Tacony" moniker.
- His apartment is in a South Philadelphia row house where he has lived for seven years; his landlord does not ask questions. The reinforced cage takes up half his bedroom - custom-built steel bars anchored floor-to-ceiling, heavy-duty padlocks locked from within using a long metal hook, food and water dispensers, and a thin mattress replaced every few months.
- His confirmation of the Bloodhound identity change to the Cape Watch blogger was characteristically blunt: "Yeah, she retired. I'm Bloodhound now."
- EMT Sophia Martinez, who had worked with both Bloodhounds, was among those who noticed the differences at the Spring Garden telekinetic incident.
- Drives a beat-up Honda and receives welfare benefits, creating tension with NSRA requirements since gainful employment would affect his eligibility.
- Vincenzo's, where he and Finn celebrated his first night out, is a cash-only Italian joint with red checkered tablecloths, candles in wine bottles, and photos of Frank Sinatra on the walls.
- Sam nicknamed Derek "Cujo."
- Derek's political leanings are anarchist-leaning; when discussing the whistleblower website he remarked "I wish the government was gone."
- His nose has been broken twelve or more times: "When you get punched in the face, either your nose goes or your jaw goes." It resets in wolf form each night, only to re-break in human form.
- The Monopoly money used in the Squeal sting was Derek's idea - bright orange $500 bills, since he couldn't "just pull 60 grand out of my ass real quick."
- Does not know his mother and has never discussed her.
- Sees a vet/doctor hybrid for medical care: "I know a guy. Does dogs and people."
- Doesn't follow group chats and hates being in North Philly.
