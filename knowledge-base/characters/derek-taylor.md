??? warning "Background"

    Derek Taylor was born in Boston to Finn Taylor, a low-level Irish mob associate who worked under boss Callahan. In 2002, during the early emergence of superheroes, Finn and his associates watched news coverage of a superhero named Windstorm thwarting a robbery in Chicago at their regular haunt, The Clover & Harp dive bar. Finn attended a secret meeting with a younger mobster named Sean and others considering breaking away from Callahan, but Russian mobsters interrupted the meeting. A masked vigilante intervened, easily defeating the Russians and warning Finn's group to change their ways. Shaken by the encounter and motivated by a desire to give his young son a better life, Finn confided in his friend Mikey Flanagan, who suggested leaving Boston entirely. Finn spent several weeks planning the departure, using "family drama" as his cover story for Callahan. On the night they left, Finn spotted another costumed figure swinging between buildings as they crossed the bridge out of Boston, confirming his belief he was making the right choice. He moved himself and Derek to Philadelphia, using construction work as a cover for their fresh start.

    Derek grew up in Philadelphia and at some point developed werewolf abilities, which cause him to involuntarily transform into a wolf-like form at sundown every night. Unable to control the transformation, Derek adopted a grim routine of dosing himself with veterinary-grade tranquilizers and locking himself into a reinforced cage in his apartment each evening. This nightly imprisonment effectively cut him off from normal social life for approximately seven years and contributed to his antisocial demeanor. He also accumulated a petty criminal record during this period.

    Derek met Sam Small in a trauma support group for superhumans led by Dr. Jensen in April 2024, where he was notably confrontational and dismissive, consistently leaving sessions early before sunset. After recognizing Sam as the vigilante Bloodhound, Derek approached her for help when his friend Elias Franklin took the power-enhancing drug Fly and transformed into the chimeric villain "Chimera." This collaboration marked Derek's entry into the vigilante world and his gradual integration into Sam's network of allies. In late October 2025, following Sam's retirement from the Bloodhound identity, Derek enrolled in an NSRA experimental trial for Vysera (daxerimab) after three months of screening. The drug provides 14 doses per week, each suppressing his transformation for 3-4 hours. He was fitted with a monitoring bracelet that tracks his location and biometrics, managed by Agent Sarah Jennings. Derek administered his first dose at 5:05 PM and watched the sunset without transforming for the first time in seven years. That evening, he met his father Finn for dinner at Vincenzo's Restaurant and walked the Philadelphia streets after dark, seeing the stars for the first time in years. During his first week on the trial, Derek used his enhanced daytime senses to locate missing college student Gina Martinez, infiltrating an underground club in Fishtown where she was being given experimental drugs and extracting her safely. At his first weekly NSRA check-in, Agent Jennings questioned irregular biometric readings and warned him against vigilante activities, which Derek denied. On Halloween morning, he met Amelia (Gossamer) at a high school to receive a modified Bloodhound costume redesigned for his larger frame, with both summer and winter variations, and officially assumed the Bloodhound II identity.

??? note "Powers & Abilities"

    **PERKS Assessment**

    No official PERKS assessment on file.

    **Abilities**

    - **Involuntary Werewolf Transformation** - Transforms into a wolf-like form at sundown each night. The transformation is entirely involuntary and has occurred nightly for approximately seven years. In wolf form, Derek possesses enhanced strength and speed.
    - **Enhanced Sense of Smell (Daytime)** - Even in human form, Derek possesses a heightened sense of smell that functions during daylight hours. This makes him a particularly effective tracker, capable of following scent trails through urban environments, identifying individuals by smell, and detecting specific odors such as ozone.
    - **Injury Reset on Transformation** - Injuries sustained in one form vanish when Derek changes between human and wolf forms. This effective regeneration occurs at each transformation, meaning wounds accumulated during the day heal when he transforms at sunset, and vice versa.
    - **Enhanced Senses (Wolf Form)** - In wolf form, all senses are significantly heightened beyond their already enhanced daytime levels.

    **Limitations**

    - **No Transformation Control** - Derek cannot choose when to transform. The change occurs involuntarily at sundown every night, requiring him to secure himself beforehand.
    - **Nightly Incapacitation** - Without Vysera, Derek is effectively incapacitated every night, forced to tranquilize himself and lock himself in a cage to prevent harm.
    - **Vysera Time Limit** - The experimental drug Vysera suppresses his transformation for only 3-4 hours per dose, creating a strict operational window after dark. He receives 14 doses per week.
    - **Sunset Deadline** - All daytime operations must conclude before sunset, or Derek risks transforming in an uncontrolled environment. This creates constant time pressure during missions.
    - **NSRA Monitoring** - While on the Vysera trial, Derek wears a monitoring bracelet that tracks his location and biometrics. Agent Jennings has warned him against vigilante activities based on suspicious readings.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Skilled street fighter with experience using brass knuckles and a switchblade in close combat.
    - Experienced tracker who combines his enhanced sense of smell with investigative methodology, conducting private investigations including missing persons cases.
    - Possesses street-level intelligence networks and criminal contacts from his background.
    - Competent at undercover work and bluffing, as demonstrated during the Sparkplug infiltration and his private investigation work in Fishtown.

??? warning "Personality"

    Derek is gruff, antisocial, and bluntly practical, with a deep streak of cynicism born from years of living under the constraints of his condition. He speaks with little regard for social niceties and maintains emotional distance from almost everyone. His confrontational demeanor was evident from his first appearance in the support group, where he scoffed at others' sharing and left sessions early without explanation. He carries himself with the wariness of someone accustomed to operating alone and trusting no one.

    Beneath the abrasive exterior, Derek demonstrates a capacity for loyalty and self-sacrifice. He held a switchblade to his own throat to save Sam during the Chimera confrontation, and he stabbed his friend Elias to provide Sam with a blood trail for tracking. He is reliable when it counts, even if he resists being seen that way. His assumption of the Bloodhound identity reveals a desire for purpose and connection that he would likely never articulate. His approach to the role is more methodical and less hands-on than Sam's, with greater command presence but less familiarity with emergency protocols. When Cape Watch Philly blogger Alicia C. tracked him down conducting a missing person investigation with a notebook in a South Philly vacant lot, Derek's confirmation was characteristically dismissive of public relations: "People who need to know, know." He shows no interest in ceremony, announcements, or public perception, focusing entirely on the work itself.

??? warning "Trivia"

    - Derek has orange hair and typically wears a leather jacket.

    - His apartment in South Philadelphia features a reinforced cage specifically built for containing his wolf form during nightly transformations.
    - The public became aware of the Bloodhound identity change partly because Derek has a notably broader build and taller frame than Sam, and his movement patterns and behavior differed significantly.

    - The Auditors gave him the Bloodhound equipment and costume as a show of good faith after Sam retired.
    - He operates publicly as a "public investigator" (vigilante detective) and people are aware he is a different person than the original Bloodhound.
    - Derek's first Vysera dose was administered at exactly 5:05 PM, and his monitoring bracelet tracked biometric irregularities during his first week that raised NSRA suspicion about unauthorized vigilante activities.
