## Background

Benjamin "Ben" Small grew up in New York City during the chaotic 1980s, developing a pragmatic awareness of urban danger. His father Morris "Pop-Pop Moe" Small taught him to shoot as a teenager, rooted in the family's Shoah history - Moe's mother was a Holocaust survivor, and Moe grew up with "never again" etched into everything. Ben purchased his first firearm at twenty-one, eventually putting it away when Sam was born.

A former metalhead and leftist activist, Ben attended Drexel University, where he met Rachel de Leon. He channeled his activist energy into systemic work, becoming a city planner focused on Philadelphia's zoning laws and urban infrastructure. He does not drink - he once tried to sneak Pop-Pop Moe's liquor at thirteen and spat it out everywhere.

Ben's life changed dramatically when Sam gained shark-based powers in 2023. He pulled strings to get her JLUMA approved in an hour instead of the standard three-to-five days. From that point forward, he navigated the impossible tension between protecting his daughter and respecting her growing independence as a superhero - a tension that escalated when the Kingdom of Keys destroyed their home (Arc 2) and again when he shot Rush Order to protect Sam on South Street (Arc 12), earning the viral nickname "Gun Dad."

- **City Planning Expertise** - Professional knowledge of Philadelphia's zoning, infrastructure, commercial corridors, sewer systems, and urban development.

## Personality

Ben is analytical, methodical, and somewhat emotionally detached in communication, with autism spectrum characteristics - he has acknowledged being "harder to mask" during stressful periods. He speaks carefully, mixing dry humor with genuine concern in a way that appears reserved but conceals deep feeling. His favorite comedic bit is "playing dumb" to provoke Sam. He gravitates toward structural and institutional solutions rather than reactive ones, framing his city planning career as a form of systemic protection.

Beneath the measured exterior, Ben struggles with fear he rarely articulates. He carries insecurity about his career compared to Sam's heroism, and has argued with Moe about whether his primary duty is protection or support. His activist past gives him unique insight into Sam's compulsive drive to fix things at personal cost - their conversations frequently center on the difference between fixing problems and dealing with people, and the importance of living long enough to see one's work through (Arc 10).

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |

| Dean Carver (Rush Order) | Adversary | Both wounded in the South Street exchange (Arc 12). Rush Order placed Ben under Rogue Wave's "protection" and released a video framing the incident as exemplifying Rogue Wave's philosophy. |
| Niles Nolan (Shrike) | Adversary | Confronted Shrike during the home invasion but was neutralized by spike "embryos" threatening to impale both parents (Arc 13). |
| Jordan Westwood (Safeguard) | Daughter's teammate | Navigated Jordan's gender identity with genuine effort early on. Has come to accept the Auditors as part of Sam's life. |

    In Interlude RS.3, present at a Friday Shabbos dinner where he is making challah while Moe prepares brisket.

Shot Rush Order during the South Street confrontation (Ch. 188), arriving in the family Honda CR-V with his Smith & Wesson 9mm handgun. Both men were wounded in the exchange of gunfire - Rush Order hit in the left shoulder, Ben hit in the right thigh (through-and-through wound, muscle damage, narrowly missed femoral artery). Transported to Jefferson Hospital by "Mike," a Good Samaritan wearing an Eagles cap. Underwent surgery. Woke briefly while Pop-Pop Moe was at his bedside. Social media immediately dubbed him "Gun Dad" (and "Gun DILF"), with bystander footage going viral and the BloodhoundWatch channel surging from 20 to 2,000 members. Rush Order was spotted at a Camden underground clinic with a "mangled" left shoulder. Rush Order released a video declaring Ben under Rogue Wave's protection, framing the incident as exemplifying Rogue Wave's philosophy that "Freedom isn't given, it's taken" - a strategic move using Ben as leverage between Kingdom and Rogue Wave. Rachel announced herself as "Gun Dad's wife" at Richardson's town hall confrontation (Ch. 191), stating that Ben opposes the anti-vigilante legislation. In the aftermath, Ben and Rachel established new family boundaries: a GPS tracker, mandatory communication before going out, and the understanding that they cannot stop Sam from being Bloodhound.

When Victor Blanc arrived uninvited at the Small home (Ch. 199), Ben placed his gun and magazine on the kitchen table as a precaution. After Victor revealed he had hit Rachel and Sam punched him, Ben later revealed Victor's last name (Blanc) and that Victor had been "different" before - more engaged when Rachel was young, until something changed around age six or seven following a stroke. Ben told Sam that people with ASPD "don't do vigilante work out of justice." During the Shrike home invasion at 3:17 AM (Ch. 203), Ben arrived with his gun but was neutralized when Shrike grew spike "embryos" throughout the house walls and threatened to impale both parents. Shrike grazed Sam's ear and nearly pierced Ben's chin with a spike. The family fled the house after Shrike departed, ending the arc.

    Evacuated to the Music Hall (Auditors HQ) at 3:42 AM with Rachel and Sam after the Shrike home invasion (Ch. 204). Carried his laptop, a fireproof lockbox, and his gun secured on person. Still using a cane. Told Sam bluntly: "It is your fault" (in a causative sense, not moral blame). Acknowledged being "harder to mask" under stress (autism coding).

Went with Derek to pick up essentials from the house. Researched Drexel University incidents on his laptop, noting the dead animals there had a different MO from Shrike's confirmed attacks (possibly copycat).

Participated in establishing new rules: GPS tracker active at all times, parents informed before any patrols or missions, parents have veto power, no bail if arrested under new anti-vigilante laws. When Sam announced "I don't think I want to be Bloodhound anymore," Ben simply said: "Then don't be." Participated in family therapy sessions with Dr. Eleanor Kaplan (at least four sessions by this point), addressing Sam's retirement, his gun ownership, and family anxiety patterns. Revealed he had been sleeping with his gun again since the Shrike invasion - first time since before Sam was born. Discussed the generational trauma angle: Moe's mother survived the Shoah, Moe taught "never again," Ben bought his first gun at twenty-one. Took Sam to the Philadelphia Sportsmen's Association for gun maintenance and shooting practice (Ch. 214), greeted by Carl (a range acquaintance), using Lane 7. Demonstrated cleaning and maintenance, then fired twelve shots clustered near center. Sam fired once, went wide, and decided she did not want to shoot again. Provided the quote: "Some responsibilities don't go away just because you're not actively using them." Also noted that his grandmother Leah used to take him to a range upstate when he was fourteen, while Pop-Pop Moe preferred shooting watermelons in the woods.

Provided city planning maps, survey maps, infrastructure overlays, and sewer plans for Mayfair, Tacony, and Northeast Philadelphia to support Sam's operations. Helped Maxwell Martinez with a GIS model, pointing out that Kingdom expansion follows infrastructure (commercial corridors, bus routes, foot traffic) rather than spreading radially - adjusting projections so that a Cottman Avenue stretch would be hit a day earlier than originally predicted. Alert when the power goes out at night, counting break-in reports (fourteen by his count, all systematic, all in the mapped commercial corridor zone during the 1-4 AM window). Cross-referenced incidents with the territory map. Shoveled the front steps in winter coat with snow nearly to his knees. Hosted Auditors meetings at the Small home. Surveyed the "war room" in the dining room with coffee mug and newspaper. Told Alex Kirby to call his parents by five.

Deduces Sam is Megalodon after Mr. Donovan asks around the neighborhood about the new shark-themed vigilante - "He didn't put it together. But I did" (Ch. 242). Participates in the family negotiation of Megalodon patrol terms: a diagrammed route, bail points, home by ten, text check-ins. Helps with tactical information, spotting a construction detour on Harbison that narrows an alley along the patrol route.
