## Background

Lena Trinh-Norwood holds a PhD and worked as a genetic engineering researcher prior to joining the Kingdom of Keys. She operated out of a private laboratory alongside her companion Scylla, a chimera of her own creation. Despite evident brilliance, the conventional academic world frustrated her - ethical review boards, bureaucratic grant processes, and supplementing her income with barista work left her deeply dissatisfied. She possessed metahuman abilities that allowed her to combine living organisms in ways that defied conventional biology, but mainstream science offered no legitimate outlet.

In approximately December 2021, Mrs. Zenith and Mr. Bomb recruited her into the Kingdom (depicted in Interlude LTN.1) through a combination of coercion - an explosive device disguised as a cigarette - and an offer of unlimited resources and scientific freedom. Though the recruitment involved threats, Trinh-Norwood has consistently framed her decision as pragmatic: a steady paycheck and unfettered science beat hustling for grants. She adopted the moniker "Dr. Xenograft" and rose to become the de facto head of the Philadelphia branch's drug operations, developing both Hypeman and Vysera. Her role expanded well beyond creature creation into pharmacology and strategic planning, making her one of the most operationally significant members of the branch.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Chimeric Fusion ("Xenografting")** - Combines two animals into a single stable, sterile hybrid organism in a modular, "lego style" fashion. Precision scales directly with her anatomical knowledge of each species - the more she understands, the finer her control over which traits are selected, combined, or omitted.
- **Consciousness Merging** - Two living animals produce a gestalt consciousness; if one source is dead, the living animal's consciousness assumes sole ownership. Trinh-Norwood prefers one dead and one living specimen, finding true gestalt consciousness philosophically uncomfortable.
- **Chimera Stability** - Creations are biologically stable and viable long-term, functioning as coherent organisms. They are sterile and cannot reproduce.

### Limitations

- Requires physical access to both source animals.
- Precision is limited by her anatomical knowledge of the species involved.
- Chimeras are sterile.
- Mr. Antithesis's power negation appears to adversely affect her chimeric creations (Scylla was left outside during their meeting).
- Trinh-Norwood herself is physically baseline human with no combat abilities.

### Training & Skills

- PhD-level training in zoology, biology, genetics, and pharmacokinetics. Exceptional anatomical knowledge across a wide range of species.
- Natural aptitude for animal husbandry and training; animals respond positively to her even without her metahuman abilities.
- Developed Hypeman (Compound J-237) and Vysera (daxerimab), demonstrating advanced expertise in drug design and biochemistry.
- Understands Rogue Wave's Jump drug at a molecular level, including its compound architecture, delivery system, and failure modes.

## Personality

Trinh-Norwood is haughty, precise, and unapologetically pedantic, treating language as a tool of accuracy rather than social bonding. She is extremely autistic, particularly in matters relating to animals - her greatest professional strength and most pronounced social liability. She insists on being called a mad *zoologist*, not a mad *scientist*, a distinction she considers non-negotiable. She views most people as operating at a lower intellectual register.

Her most notable trait is a frequent failure to register social cues related to intimidation. She is not cowed by dangerous individuals - not out of bravery, but because she is genuinely unaware she should be frightened. This makes her interactions with figures like Mr. Antithesis and Mr. Tyrannosaur distinctly different from those of her more deferential colleagues. Despite her social detachment, scientific curiosity can override her dismissiveness, as when she shifted from scoffing at the Fly drug to genuine interest.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Superior / Recruiter | Recruited Trinh-Norwood alongside Mr. Bomb. Acting boss of the Philadelphia branch; the two interact regularly on operational matters. |
| Blake Matthews (Mr. Tyrannosaur) | Colleague / Romantic tension | Frequent sarcastic exchanges and acknowledged sexual tension. Tyrannosaur consults her on paleontological literature, though he needs her to translate the technical material. |
| Trent Fairfax (Mr. Antithesis) | Superior (Kingdom leadership) | Rewarded her with a raise and Hypeman profit-sharing after her LTN.2 presentation, but warned against further failures. His power negation adversely affects her chimeras. |
| Mr. Nothing (Darnell) | Colleague | Coordinated with Trinh-Norwood on rebuilding Hypeman production in Camden after his liberation. |
| Mr. Polygraph | Colleague | Assigned to coordinate with Trinh-Norwood on Hypeman production. |
| Mrs. Heartbeat | Colleague | Escaped the zoo heist with some of the stolen poison dart frogs. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary | Their encounters range from hostile (Crescent nightclub, home invasion) to surprisingly civil (Philadelphia Zoo conversation about animals). |
| Scylla | Companion animal | Greyhound-lobster chimera and constant companion. Armored, combat-capable, and present from before her Kingdom recruitment. |
| Darwin | Pet | A glow-in-the-dark axolotl. Not a combat pet. |
| Rogue Wave / Daisy Zhen | Indirect connection | Reverse-engineered aspects of Jump to create Hypeman; cultured cells from Daisy Zhen to produce Compound B. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First appears at the Crescent nightclub in Chapter 25 as "Mrs. X" alongside Mrs. Heartbeat and Mr. Tyrannosaur. Sam and Jordan encounter her in the VIP section during their undercover infiltration. Identified as having a giant bluish greyhound named Scylla. Commands Scylla to attack Sam and Jordan when their cover is blown. Scylla pins Sam with precision. The Kingdom operatives interrogate the two teenagers before Sam and Jordan execute a dramatic escape. In Chapter 26, Crossroads identifies "Mrs. X" as Dr. Xenograft, a known villain who has recently joined the Kingdom. In Chapter 27, her chimeric creatures - raccoon-tarantula hybrids and basset hound-crow hybrids wearing collars with electric devices - invade the Small family home. In Chapter 28, Mr. Tyrannosaur and Mrs. Z escalate the attack on the house, with Xenograft's diverse chimera menagerie (including opossum-copperhead hybrids, a rottweiler-deer hybrid, and a turtle-crab lockpicker) participating in the assault that ultimately destroys Sam's home.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Featured in Blake Matthews's interlude (BM.1) set in late April 2024. Appears at Kingdom headquarters in South Philadelphia (disguised as an accounting firm) alongside Mrs. Zenith, Mr. Tyrannosaur, and Mr. Polygraph. Becomes distracted by a dying ficus plant during a leadership meeting. Engages in sarcastic exchanges with Tyrannosaur, with Zenith mediating. Scylla is present and displays unusual characteristics. When Mr. Polygraph reports the emergence of the Fly drug, Trinh-Norwood initially dismisses the possibility of power-granting pills but shows scientific curiosity. The group debates the strategic implications of Fly for Kingdom operations.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow (Interlude LTN.1)"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude)

    Origin interlude set in approximately December 2021. Depicts Trinh-Norwood's recruitment as summarized in Background: Zenith and Mr. Bomb bypass her lab security, plant the coercive explosive cigarette, and she travels through snowy streets with Scylla to a Kingdom-owned bar where she accepts their offer of unlimited resources and scientific freedom. Adopts the name "Dr. Xenograft."

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam and Tasha encounter Trinh-Norwood unexpectedly at the Philadelphia Zoo (Ch. 126). She engages Sam in a surprisingly civil conversation about animals, reveals she is wearing a wire, and warns Sam to be careful before being escorted away. Operation Ivory - the Kingdom's zoo heist - uses Mr. Tyrannosaur as a distraction while operatives steal poison dart frogs for Trinh-Norwood's drug research from the Reptile House. Mrs. Heartbeat escapes with some frogs; Mr. Nothing and Mudslide are captured.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol (Interlude LTN.2)"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude)

    Meets with Mr. Antithesis at his sterile New York City skyscraper office shortly after the zoo incident; Zenith warns her to leave Scylla outside, implying Mr. Antithesis's abilities are harmful to chimeras. She presents Hypeman (Compound J-237), explaining its relationship to Jump's Compound A: Compound A transmits powers but is unstable without a proper delivery system, and Jump requires extensive pharmacokinetics knowledge to prevent users from "folding in on themselves." She details how poison dart frog and bee hybrids create stable compounds, has cultured Daisy Zhen's cells to produce Compound B, and reveals that Hypeman and Jump are fatally incompatible when mixed. Takes responsibility for the Operation Ivory captures. Mr. Antithesis rewards her with a raise and profit-sharing but warns against further failures.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced when the Auditors discuss the Kingdom's operations and the implications of the stolen poison dart frogs. Hypeman begins appearing on Philadelphia's streets as a product of her research.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Hypeman autoinjectors feature prominently in the plot. After the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse is destroyed, Mrs. Xenograft is noted as displeased since the Hypeman operation was her idea. Maya assigns Mr. Polygraph and Mr. Nothing to coordinate with her on rebuilding production at a Camden backup facility (Interlude MR.7).

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Hypeman withdrawal continues to affect Sam. Tasha theorizes the drug was designed with addictive properties as a control mechanism.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the Daedalus prison break planning meeting at Bella Notte restaurant in Staten Island (Interlude BM.3), where Mr. Antithesis briefs Kingdom operatives on the Red Calf-contracted extraction of Deathgirl. Arrives with a pet carrier containing an unidentified creature, with Scylla trailing behind - now grown to hip height. Identifies a missing section in the Daedalus blueprints provided by Red Calf's Porcelain - approximately thirty feet of second-floor southeast corridor that should connect two wings based on external dimensions - raising concerns about the intelligence quality of the operation. Her role in the operation itself is designated as providing "additional chaos," with the exact terms left to her discretion. Devonte Harris is also working on Hypeman analysis with "Dr. M from Penn" during this period.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Shrike uses a Hypeman autoinjector during the Van Kirk battle against Sam, ultimately dying from accumulated injuries with Hypeman burning through his system. Vysera (daxerimab) enters NSRA experimental trials (Interlude DT.2); Derek Taylor enrolls to suppress his werewolf transformation, receiving 14 doses per week with each providing three to four hours of absolute power suppression.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Derek continues using Vysera voluntarily. Congress discusses using it to depower inmates for transfer to regular prisons instead of Daedalus (Ch. 222). In Interlude MR.9, Mrs. Xenograft is mentioned as working on something related to power nullification, confirming her direct involvement in Vysera's development.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Vysera continues in NSRA experimental trials. Trinh-Norwood does not appear directly.


## Trivia

- Prefers "Dr." to "Mrs." given her doctoral credentials, though the Kingdom's alphabetical convention assigns her the "X" designation.
- Scylla is named after the multi-limbed sea monster from Greek mythology. Darwin, her glow-in-the-dark axolotl, is presumably named after Charles Darwin.
- Became distracted by a dying ficus plant during a high-level Kingdom strategy meeting.
- Vysera's generic name, daxerimab, follows the "-mab" suffix convention for monoclonal antibody drugs, indicating a biological pharmaceutical design.
- Her identification of a missing corridor in the Daedalus blueprints (BM.3) demonstrates analytical competence well beyond biology.
- Whether the coercive explosive cigarette from her recruitment was ever deactivated remains narratively unresolved.
