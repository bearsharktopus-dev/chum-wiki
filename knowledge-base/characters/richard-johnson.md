## Background

Richard Johnson is a high school dropout who failed the police academy before enlisting in the U.S. military in 2007. He barely passed the ASVAB, drawing open disappointment from his father. During boot camp, he collapsed from exhaustion and organ failure, triggering a superpower activation that granted him peak human enhancement. The military deemed him unfit for regular service, but the NSRA took immediate interest, producing a Power Assessment dated September 13th, 2007.

Richard was part of the initial batch of test subjects for Project Titan, a secret military black ops program run with the NSRA's full knowledge. The program aimed to create elite enhanced soldiers and to produce superhumans artificially through drugs - the latter effort producing "just a lot of cancer." Deployed overseas from 2007 to 2013, Richard was involved in documented war crimes across multiple countries, including extrajudicial killings, torture of prisoners, and coverups of civilian casualties. These activities are documented but buried in classified files. By 2017, he had fully adopted the Patriot identity, attending his father's funeral as a known superhero before departing with teammates Natalie and Sean.

Richard settled in Philadelphia and founded Pattinson's Pals, a vigilante group that claimed to promote law and order but employed racist and oppressive tactics. The Pals operated out of Patty's Bar in South Philadelphia and maintained close ties with local law enforcement and school security. After his public exposure as the man behind the Patriot mask following the homecoming incident and the Halloween confrontation with Bloodhound, the movement "deflated overnight."

Councilwoman Maya Richardson later recruited Richard to lead Argus Corps, a government-sanctioned superhero task force, specifically targeting him because he was "disgraced" and desperate. He left the Pals in the hands of Sean McNulty (Bulldozer) and became the public face of institutional superhero regulation.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | Gigant |
| **Category** | Gigant |
| **Power Ranking** | Unknown |
| **Control** | Unknown |
| **Hostility** | Unknown |
| **Collateral Damage** | Unknown |
| **Threat Level** | Unknown |

Full numerical ratings are not available, but his Gigant classification is established.

### Abilities

- **Peak Human Enhancement** - Every physical attribute operates at the absolute ceiling of human capability: strength, speed, dexterity, reaction time, endurance, and durability. No single stat is superhuman in isolation, but the cumulative package makes him extraordinarily dangerous. His vascular system is visibly swollen and throbbing, reflecting the extent of enhancement.
- **Enhanced Cognition (Theoretical)** - His brain has been enhanced alongside his body, but this does not translate into greater intelligence or curiosity - he is simply unintelligent and incurious more efficiently. He does demonstrate strong deductive and investigative instincts despite this limitation.

### Limitations

- Not superhuman in any single attribute; a sufficiently powerful metahuman can overpower him through raw force.
- Because his power is technically the ceiling of natural human capability, power negators like Mr. Nothing cannot turn it off - there is nothing superhuman for the negation to target (demonstrated in Chapter 246).
- Intellectually incurious and struggles with complex analysis despite enhanced processing speed.
- Emotionally rigid and prone to escalation; ideology frequently blinds him to manipulation.

### Training & Skills

- U.S. military boot camp (2007) and further training through Project Titan.
- Expert hand-to-hand combatant, proficient with his shield as both defensive and offensive weapon (traditional design, not throwable).
- Maintains a rigorous physical regimen (100 reps at 350 lbs).
- Skilled tactical commander, coordinating Argus Corps operations.
- Capable investigator when motivated - independently and secretly researched Maya Richardson's connections (Intermission 15.5).

## Personality

Richard is self-righteous, authoritarian, and utterly convinced of his moral superiority. He speaks in formal, almost militaristic tones - Jordan described him as talking "like a fucking thesaurus." His worldview is that of a militant neoliberal: liberal democracy and Western values represent the natural end state of civilization, and must be enforced by any means necessary. He is a devotee of Fukuyama's "The End of History," though his understanding is shallow - he uses it as an ideological totem rather than an intellectual foundation. His xenophobic nationalism is framed in cultural rather than explicitly racial terms, though he reads neo-Nazi websites, claiming them as "research." He is anti-immigrant, anti-intellectual, and openly contemptuous of academia.

Despite this, Richard is not a simple brute. He operates according to a genuine, if deeply flawed, moral code and has shown capacity for pragmatism (e.g., negotiating a truce with Sam after the Halloween fight). His complicated relationship with his father hints at deeper emotional currents beneath the rigid exterior. His secret investigation into Maya Richardson and willingness to consider a coup suggest his loyalty to institutions has limits when they fail his standards.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Antagonist / Evolving | Began as a violent adversary - beat Sam at the homecoming dance and learned her identity when her helmet shattered at the Halloween fight. Relationship shifted in Arc 16 when he saved her from Mr. Nothing and told her he is "starting to get sick of my boss." Shared distrust of Richardson is pushing them toward reluctant alignment. |
| Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Handler / Subject of Investigation | Recruited him to lead Argus Corps because he was "disgraced" and desperate. As of Arc 16, he is secretly investigating her Kingdom connections and considering a coup. Maya observes: "That's the problem with building a weapon. Eventually, it develops opinions about who it should be pointed at." |
| Jordan Westwood (Safeguard) | Target | Attempted to arrest Jordan at homecoming; Sam negotiated Jordan's safety as part of their Halloween truce. |
| Natalie (Egalitarian) | Former Teammate | Pattinson's Pals partner with a vertigo/balance disruption field affecting only non-powered people. Sam leveraged evidence of her Fly drug use during the Halloween negotiation; Patriot initially defended her loyalty. |
| Sean McNulty (Bulldozer) | Former Subordinate | Succeeded Richard as Pals leader. Relayed Sam's accusations about Richardson to Richard, presenting evidence about Tremont & Fairfax, weather anomalies, and Richard Duvall's suspicious death. |
| Jasmine Perez (Turbo Jett) | Teammate | Argus Corps member who pushes back on Richard's methods and advocates for suspects' rights. Has been watching Maya differently since Patriot started asking budget questions. |
| Joshua Pleasants (Miasma) | Teammate (Mole) | Warned Richard to "be careful with Richardson." Secretly a mole working against the Kingdom from within Argus Corps; sent backup when Mr. Nothing intercepted Sam on the subway. |
| Andrew Mitchell (Captain Devil) | Teammate / Rival | Regularly gives and receives shiners from Richard - a dynamic Maya designed intentionally. Independently investigating Richardson alongside Jett, though the two teams have not compared notes. |
| Darnell Hayes (Mr. Nothing) | Enemy | Confronted in Chapter 246; Richard exploited the fact that Nothing's power negation cannot affect peak-human physiology, forcing Nothing to choose between his objectives and his freedom. |
| Richard Johnson Sr. | Father (Deceased) | Relationship marked by paternal disappointment. Richard delivered a conflicted eulogy at his 2017 funeral. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First appears in Chapter 104 at Patty's Bar with Egalitarian. Described as towering, barrel-chested, bald, with piercing blue eyes, wearing a red/white/blue stars-and-stripes costume with a round star-motif shield - an overt Captain America homage that Jordan calls "Captain America cosplay." He and Egalitarian confront Sam and Jordan in the parking lot, ordering them to drop their "little crusade" and warning that "this is one hornet's nest you do NOT want to kick." The Pals receive open deference from the bar's patrons, and Patriot is connected to Principal Heckerman and possibly Mayor Watkins.

    During the Fedorov sentencing in September, Patriot incites crowds outside the courthouse with a megaphone, blaming the NSRA, FBI, CIA, and INS, making anti-immigrant statements ("If INS had deported Fedorov when he first came here"), and organizing rallies. His rhetoric contributes to riots in three or more neighborhoods and prompts a city council emergency meeting on metahuman containment.

    Sam reverse-pickpockets blood onto Patriot's suit jacket at a public appearance outside City Hall in order to track his movements via blood sense. The Auditors surveil Patriot's movements and record a warehouse meeting where he discusses plans to expand Pattinson's Pals nationally ("San Diego is already interested in our services"), push anti-superhuman legislation to create demand for private security contracts, and dismiss non-villain supers as "collateral damage." Sam obtains Project Titan intelligence from Devonte Harris and Akilah Washington at Chambers & Woo Investigations, confirming Patriot was part of the initial batch of Project Titan test subjects with documented war crimes from 2007-2013.

    Crashes the Tacony Charter Academy homecoming dance flanked by Egalitarian and a phalanx of police in full tactical gear, announcing they are looking for Jordan Westwood in connection with "cybercrimes and acts of domestic terrorism." Egalitarian activates her vertigo power - a balance-disruption field that only affects non-powered people - which inadvertently identifies Sam and Jordan as powered individuals because they are the only ones left standing. Patriot brutally beats Sam in the gymnasium in front of the student body: trained boxer's combinations, breaking her nose with a headbutt, cracking her ribs, and grabbing her by the throat. Sam involuntarily grows teeth from her palms during the fight. Students rally around Sam and Jordan, forming a human wall with linked arms and recording phones. Mike Giannopoulos grabs Patriot's leg while retching from Egalitarian's vertigo. Patriot retreats when he realizes he is no longer fighting two kids but the entire school. The beating is captured on video, becoming the "Homecoming Video."

    Sam confronts Patriot at a Dilworth Park protest, approaching him in full Bloodhound costume with her LUMA credential. During their extended conversation, Patriot reveals his Fukuyama worldview, his NSRA handler background, and his contempt for Sam's family. Sam probes him about Project Titan and drops hints about Egalitarian's Fly drug use. They arrange a midnight meeting at an abandoned warehouse at Penn Treaty Park on Halloween night.

    At the Halloween confrontation, Sam arrives hours early and prepares tripwires, a light killswitch (built by Tasha), pig's blood spray for blood-sense tracking, a gauntlet loaded with twin syringes, and pepper spray. Patriot arrives alone as agreed, naming his team members: Zero, Egalitarian, Para, and Bulldozer. The fight is brutal: Sam uses darkness, pig's blood tracking, Aikido redirects learned from Rampart, and tripwires. Patriot dislocates Sam's shoulder, breaks her wrist, cracks her ribs, and shatters her helmet - exposing her face and definitively revealing that Sam Small is Bloodhound. Sam buries teeth from her palm into Patriot's collarbone and injects him with twin syringes, claiming the contents are poison. The "poison" is actually saline. Sam negotiates a truce, demanding he stand down, leave Jordan alone, stick to South Philly, and agree to a mutual non-aggression pact. She bluffs a dead man's switch and a friendship with DA Carla Alvarez. Patriot takes the spare saline syringe thinking it is an antidote. Sam gives him her first aid kit: "It's not charity. It's mercy."

    Interlude RJ.1 reveals his backstory: struggling to pass the ASVAB in 2007, collapsing during boot camp, undergoing a painful superpower activation, being deemed unfit for regular service, and attending his father's funeral as Patriot in 2017.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    The "Homecoming Video" of Patriot attacking Sam went viral just days before Maya Richardson's City Council election, causing a "significant shift in public opinion." Combined with the whistleblower site revelations, it struck a chord with suburban voters. The "Halloween Tapes" from the warehouse fight are also referenced as a factor. News reports confirm the "sudden disappearance of Richard Johnson, the man believed to be behind the 'Patriot' mask," with Pattinson's Pals members refusing to comment and citing legal advice. The movement "deflated overnight" following his exposure. The Young Defenders are placed on indefinite suspension due to government pressure since the Patriot incident, effectively becoming "an after-school club." Sam is recognized at the Crescent nightclub from the homecoming video.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First appears at the marina fight, still operating independently. Confronts Sam, telling her to "walk away. I'll let you go." When Blink hits him with marbles from a sniper nest in an apartment window, Patriot takes a human shield to force Blink to cease fire while Sam frees zip-tied drug dealers. The Auditors escape.

    Recruited by Maya Richardson to join the nascent Argus Corps during Interlude MR.4, where Richardson orchestrates a tailored psychological appeal to his desire for order and American values in a sterile coworking space. He arrives first, early, with stiff military bearing. Richardson tells him to "show them why your methods work." The Argus Corps proposal document (Interlude MR.5) lists him formally as Richard "Patriot" Johnson, a former military asset with peak human enhancements, under Richardson's civilian oversight and NSRA review.

    At the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse confrontation, Patriot enters last alongside Turbo Jett, Miasma, and Captain Devil. Orders his team to "detain the capes" and "get the civvies out," assigning Turbo Jett to Bash, Captain Devil to Soot, Miasma to Sam, and himself to mop up Lenny and the guards. Pursues Sam up a metal staircase and grabs her ankle, squeezing until something pops. Sam donkey-kicks him in the face, breaking bone or cartilage, and lands an axe kick to the top of his head. Jordan severs the staircase beneath Sam with space-compression, and Patriot falls twelve or more feet through the gap. Richardson publicly announces Argus Corps formation at an emergency City Council session.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced through Maya Richardson's review of the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse aftermath. Patriot's Argus Corps after-action report is "heavily redacted" and "frustratingly vague," making no mention of Soot or Kingdom enforcers at the warehouse. Maya suspects the grey-helmeted figure Patriot reported (Sam) but notes a costume color change. Councilman Davis knows about Argus Corps' presence at the warehouse and is angry about crossed lines, repeatedly attempting to contact Richardson, though she ignores his messages.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Implements a "Safer Streets Initiative" offering $500 rewards for reporting "dangerous youth activities," effectively placing a price on the heads of underage heroes and creating a climate of paranoia.

    Interlude rj-2 reveals his daily routine at Argus Corps HQ: 350-pound barbell, 100 reps. Sean McNulty (Bulldozer) calls him for the third time that week, and they meet at Patty's Bar back room. Bulldozer presents evidence from Sam's investigation: the Tremont & Fairfax law firm handled both Argus Corps' incorporation and Aaron McKinley's pro bono defense; weather reports from the Small house T-Rex attack show clear skies all week despite home videos capturing torrential downpour (consistent with Stormrise, Richardson's cape name); and Richard Duvall was healthy until his last meeting with Richardson, found dead shortly after. Patriot dismisses the evidence initially but is privately troubled. He texts Turbo Jett to run a background check on Tremont & Fairfax.

    Patriot reports to Richardson at her City Hall office. She deflects everything smoothly, laughing genuinely at the Kingdom accusation, explaining Tremont & Fairfax as a large firm with many clients, and dismissing Duvall's death as that of an unhealthy old man. She tells Patriot to "set the record straight" with Sam, adding pointedly, "Are you still bitter about getting caught beating that girl up at her school?"

    At the Argus Corps team briefing in their underground training room, Patriot briefs the team on Sam's accusations. Turbo Jett is dismissive, Captain Devil is cautiously concerned, and Miasma is suspiciously neutral. Afterward, Miasma privately warns Patriot: "Be careful with Richardson. Power corrupts. So does fear." Patriot's internal narration reveals contempt for Sam, dismissing her as "dead BFF's diversity hire."

    Personally confronts Sam at a basketball court in civilian clothes as "Mr. Johnson," warning her to stop spreading "conspiracy theories" about Richardson. He seems unsettled and uncertain during the encounter. Argus Corps is assigned to protect armored transports of unknown cargo. At Richardson's town hall event, Sam crashes the proceedings as Bloodhound, raising Richard Duvall's suspicious death and the T-Rex attack evidence. Rachel Small stands up with an organized parent coalition, launching the Parents of Powered Kids movement publicly. Captain Devil confronts Sam during the ensuing chaos.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Argus Corps is referenced as operating "downtown only" during this period, with Lily noting this during her update to Sam. The Kingdom fronts remain closed and Rogue Wave is selling Jump. Not directly involved in the Shrike crisis or Daedalus breakout events of this arc.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Argus Corps commits "100% of resources" to hunting the serial killer Shrike after bird killings escalate across Northeast Philadelphia. Argus Corps checkpoints are established on major roads with Shrike mugshots. Sam is worried Patriot will use the Shrike crisis to relitigate his grudge against her.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** Supporting (Interlude AM.1)

    Runs the Argus Corps briefing at headquarters, assigning operational tasks including the Kensington phase-walker, the Turnout armored car robberies on I-95, and a ribbon-cutting in Gray's Ferry. His blunt personality is on display: "I have to take a trip to the restroom. Don't wait for me." Richardson wants visible presence at community events, so Jett is sent to the ribbon-cutting.

    Turbo Jett and Captain Devil are secretly investigating Maya Richardson behind his back, but Jett steals Patriot's phone and discovers he is running his own parallel investigation: his browser tabs include an article on barokinesis from the American Institute of Dynology (noting only two confirmed metahumans with pressure control, neither of which is Maya), an online encyclopedia article on Tyrannosaurus Rex, research on Richard Duvall (high school yearbook, stock reports, public donor info), weather reports from two years ago, and background on Councilman Silverstein. Captain Devil pieces together that Patriot told Maya months earlier that "a teenage vigilante thinks she's Kingdom" - information relayed from McNulty - which means Maya has known about Sam's investigation for some time. Miasma is noted as "different lately, more distant" and not fully on board with whatever is happening within the team.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Davis reveals that Argus Corps and Patriot want to investigate the Music Hall after it is damaged, as the Music Hall falls within Maya Richardson's council district.

    Ambushes Sam on the street with Turbo Jett in a pincer formation in Chapter 222. He steps out from between parked cars, shield catching the streetlight, and recites charges formally, enjoying the moment: unlicensed vigilantism, breaking and entering, stalking, and reckless endangerment. Jett says they have pictures of Sam's face without her helmet and security footage from twelve incidents over the preceding six weeks - all fabricated evidence produced by a shapeshifter (Alice/Mrs. Doppelganger) impersonating Sam. Patriot notes that Sam is "always armed" because "those teeth don't come off." Sam flees rather than submit, and Jett pursues at Gear Two through Tacony. When Jett catches Sam at her parents' front door and the confrontation spills onto the lawn with Mom and Dad coming outside, Patriot overrides Jett's hesitation with "We secure the suspect first," but Jett calls him "Richard" and pushes back on Sam's rights. Sam escapes again. Patriot orders a stand-down - "No guns! Stand down! Let her go!" - a calculated tactical decision, since not pursuing makes Sam look guilty while chasing would make him look aggressive. He has units moving to cut off Frankford Avenue.

    During the Remora/Stingray blizzard-night operation to capture Alice/Mrs. Doppelganger, Patriot is present at a hardware store in flag-themed combat armor alongside Jett, Captain Devil, and Miasma, providing security for "Maya" (actually Alice in disguise). When Sam (as Remora) and Amelia (as Stingray) confront "Maya," Patriot steps between them: "Stand down. You're outnumbered and outmatched." Amelia replies, "Wasn't talking to you." Amelia attacks Patriot with her hurting whip, which he blocks with his forearm before it wraps around. She sends her grabbing whip at his ankle, but he hops over it, grabs the hurting whip mid-air, and yanks Amelia into a snowbank. When Jett disagrees with Patriot about prioritizing arrest over civilian protection, Captain Devil takes command and delegates: "Miasma, you cover Maya. I'll block the route. Jett, you handle the civvies." Patriot accepts: "Fine. Delegation. I can handle these upstarts." He grabs Amelia's ankle below the padding and tries to twist it until Sam fires a rubber band from a prop weapon that catches him across the nose and eye, loosening his grip for half a second. Amelia retrieves her lost whips with her grabbing whip and cracks her sparking whip at Patriot's face - a blinding flash of flint and metal that carves a constellation of small cuts across his jawline. He stumbles, and Amelia escapes up a fire escape one-handed. Argus Corps is outmaneuvered: by prioritizing protecting "Maya," they deliver Alice directly into Miasma's custody - exactly as Sam's team planned.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Continues leading Argus Corps while secretly investigating Maya Richardson on his own, with no one aware of his suspicions - not even his teammates. Has grown to believe Richardson is either a Kingdom operative or an incompetent politician who needs to be removed from power, and is considering a coup. Argus Corps is being used by Richardson for visibility and PR, hitting Rogue Wave distribution points to maintain a public profile. Has been asking budget questions that have caused Turbo Jett to start watching Maya differently. Patriot and Captain Devil have been giving each other shiners - a dynamic Maya designed on purpose when assembling the team with incompatible personalities.

    In Chapter 246, saves Sam from Mr. Nothing on the Broad Street Line subway at City Hall station. Appears on the platform as Sam and Nothing exit. Recognizes Nothing from the Philadelphia Zoo raid and calls him by his real name - "Hayes" - demonstrating his strong memory despite his other intellectual limitations. Nothing's power negation is useless against Patriot because his "peak human condition" is technically the ceiling of natural human ability rather than anything superhuman; there is nothing for the negation to turn off. Patriot grabs Nothing's shoulder with crushing force, then seizes Nothing's wrist when he reaches for his concealed gun, grinding bone against bone to demonstrate what breaking would feel like. Presents Nothing with a triangle: strategic goals, tactical goals, or freedom - pick one. Explains that Captain Devil is already on scene, Jett is being rerouted, and Miasma is intercepting the train Nothing arrived on, so there is no extraction. Nothing picks freedom and leaves. Miasma had sent Argus Corps as backup, and Patriot was already tracking the situation before Sam knew she was in danger.

    After the confrontation, escorts Sam to City Hall for her meeting with Maya Richardson, walking half a step behind in escort formation. Waits outside the building guarding the entrance while Sam meets with Maya, then walks her to the bus stop afterward. Tells Sam he is "starting to get sick of my boss" - a significant crack in his loyalty to Richardson and an implicit acknowledgment that he and Sam are on the same side of whatever is coming.

    At the Argus Corps oversight transition meeting (Interlude MR.10), Councilman Davis's coalition of five council members has voted to transition Argus Corps oversight away from Maya, with Silverstein co-sponsoring the motion. Patriot addresses Councilman Silverstein directly rather than Maya when giving operational updates - a significant behavioral shift indicating he now recognizes the new chain of command and has stopped treating Maya as the relevant authority in the room. Jett has been watching Maya differently for two weeks since Patriot started asking budget questions. Maya internally observes: "That's the problem with building a weapon. Eventually, it develops opinions about who it should be pointed at."
