## Background

Victor Blanc is a 72-year-old long-haul trucker who has worked for Thornton Transport for 39 years. He drives a Peterbilt 379 and lives primarily in his truck, maintaining only a P.O. box in Roanoke, Virginia. Short but long and stretched, with ear-length gray hair, a bushy mustache, and typically wearing a huge overcoat. His dispatcher Maeve Hely suggested he get cats to keep him on schedule; he has two - Coal (black) and Box (gray) - named after materials he hauled most frequently.

Victor's father Harlan Blanc was a WWII veteran who beat him regularly and encouraged his violent tendencies. Even as a child, Victor showed signs of flat affect and difficulty connecting emotionally, though he had a fascination with animals - particularly the silverback gorilla at the zoo.

He had a relationship with Camilla de Leon, Sam's maternal grandmother, whom he met at Murphy's on Frankford Avenue. They had two children - David and Rachel - but never married. Victor has at least 7 children total from various relationships and at least 12 grandchildren.

At approximately age 40, Victor suffered a massive stroke that fundamentally changed him. Before the stroke, he was angry all the time - yelling, breaking things, hitting walls. Afterward, his affect became flat and clinical, as though a layer of cotton had been placed over everything. He self-identified as a sociopath approximately 10 years ago after hearing a description on a late-night radio show. He was physically abusive to Rachel, stayed six years after the stroke, then left the family and got his trucking license, sending Camilla every dollar he could afford.

### Kingdom Manipulation

In late August 2025, the Kingdom of Keys arranged Victor's visit to Philadelphia as psychological warfare against Rachel - retaliation for her coalition challenging Maya Richardson's press conference. Victor received four texts from a NYC area code burner at 3:17 AM on Interstate 81, the Kingdom having cleared his time off with his dispatcher and reserved a hotel room. Mrs. Quiet had mentioned Victor months earlier during the Soot operation; as Sam later learned, "Mr. E went digging." Victor went out of what he describes as "clinical curiosity."

Victor's visit and its aftermath are detailed in Arcs 13-14. Despite leaving Rachel a letter stating he would not contact them again, he maintained contact with Sam, and by Arc 16 their relationship has grown into a genuine (if unconventional) familial connection, with Sam calling him "Grandpa Vic."

## Powers & Abilities

Victor Blanc has no metahuman abilities. He is described as an extremely dangerous unpowered human due to his lack of empathy, clinical detachment, and physical capability despite his age. His last violent incident before visiting Philadelphia was three years prior - a drunk at a truck stop in West Virginia who tried to climb into his cab, resulting in three lost teeth and a fractured orbital socket (ruled self-defense). He has $383,267 in high-yield savings and only six contacts in his phone.

## Personality

Victor operates with flat, clinical affect and approaches relationships with analytical detachment. Extremely precise and routine-oriented - his cat Box exits the carrier at exactly 3:30 AM on an 11-year schedule, and he drives at exactly the speed limit using cruise control. After the stroke, he shifted from physical violence to threats as a "nuclear deterrent" strategy - if his heart stops, people know he can back it up.

Despite openly identifying as a sociopath, Victor has demonstrated capacity for growth. By Arc 16, he is wanting things "not related to function" - a novel experience for him. Sam herself feels Victor's influence in complicated ways; in Arc 15, she describes a violent impulse as feeling the "ghost of Victor grabbing her by the back of the throat."
