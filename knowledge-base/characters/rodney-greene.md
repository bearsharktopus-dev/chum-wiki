## Background

Rodney Greene, operating under the codename Captain Plasma, is a member of the Delaware Valley Defenders, Philadelphia's only registered superhuman team prior to the formation of Argus Corps. Originally based in Los Angeles, he relocated to Philadelphia following Liberty Belle's death to reinforce the DVD's ranks. As a registered superhuman entity, Greene is a federal employee with a public identity and law enforcement-equivalent legal protections. His extraordinary power level makes him the team's most formidable combatant, and his role centers on rapid response and hostile metahuman engagement.

Greene's most significant Philadelphia operation was commanding the prison transport of Mr. Nothing and Mudslide (Interlude RG.1), which ended in a Kingdom ambush that left him incapacitated and hospitalized with severe pneumonia. After recovering, he sparred with Sam Small in a training exercise (Ch. 178) before departing on a federally sponsored multi-city tour to combat the Jump and Fly crime wave. As of early 2026, he remains in Los Angeles.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Electromagnetic Field Manipulation** - Generates and manipulates electromagnetic fields as the basis for all combat abilities. The field extends only millimeters from his skin but provides comprehensive, near-total protection, placing him at the top of the regional power hierarchy.
- **Near-Invulnerability** - The field repels conductive material within approximately two inches of his body; physical strikes cause electrical discharge that stings the attacker.
- **Superhuman Strength** - Field manipulation augments physical output to superhuman levels (struck Mr. Tyrannosaur at supersonic speed during the zoo battle).
- **Flight** - Achieves flight through electromagnetic interaction with the Earth's magnetic field.
- **Superhuman Speed** - Moves fast enough to close combat distances almost instantaneously.
- **Voluntary Field Deactivation** - Can consciously power down the field, leaving him physically vulnerable but safe around sensitive electronics or injured allies.

### Limitations

- Field is self-contained and does not project outward as a barrier for others.
- Non-conductive or unconventional attacks can bypass the field (Mrs. Jellyjam suffocated him with a gelatinous substance, causing severe pneumonia).
- Voluntary deactivation creates exploitable openings (Sam feigned injury to trigger his concern, then struck him during the Ch. 178 sparring match).
- Operates at the "Alexandria" or "realistic Superman" tier - extraordinarily powerful but bounded within a regional scope.

### Training & Skills

- Experienced in multi-asset security operations, including decoy convoys, aerial surveillance, and anti-ESP countermeasures.
- Extensive field experience in direct superhuman combat against high-tier metahuman opponents.
- Has undercover operation experience, though at least one such mission went poorly enough that he shared it as a cautionary tale.

## Personality

Greene is unfailingly polite, optimistic, and projects calm authority. He approaches both allies and adversaries with earnest helpfulness, though this altruism sometimes reads as patronizing paternalism. He prioritizes the greater good over personal safety to a fault.

His institutional orientation places him squarely on the side of systems, process, and sanctioned authority - representing the established approach to superheroism that Sam Small grows increasingly skeptical of. Despite this philosophical divide, he demonstrates genuine warmth toward younger heroes, balancing institutional discipline with a practical understanding that rigid rule-adherence does not always serve justice.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |

| Peregrine | Operations partner | Aerial surveillance; engaged Mr. Yellowjacket during the convoy ambush. |
| Mrs. Jellyjam | Antagonist | Incapacitated Greene during the prison transport, causing severe pneumonia. |
| Mr. Tyrannosaur | Antagonist | Fought Greene at both the prison transport and the zoo. |
| Mrs. Fulcrum (Ballerina) | Antagonist | Flipped vehicles during the convoy ambush. |
| Mr. Yellowjacket (Motorcycle Guy) | Antagonist | Conducted precision pressurized-air attacks on the convoy. |
| Liberty Belle (Diane Williams) | Former teammate (deceased) | Greene told Sam that Liberty Belle "thought very highly of you" and "had a lot to say," suggesting a personal connection. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Announced in Chapter 100 as relocating from Los Angeles to Philadelphia to reinforce the Delaware Valley Defenders following Liberty Belle's death. Multiplex introduces him during a team reorganization meeting, noting his "experience and unique abilities" as a valuable addition to the DVD roster.

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Listed among the Delaware Valley Defenders at the post-homecoming-dance meeting in Chapter 113, where the team discusses the aftermath of Patriot's attack on Sam and prepares for congressional testimony on superhuman regulation.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Interrupts the Young Defenders' planning session in Chapter 123 to share a cautionary tale about his own failed undercover mission before Sam's Crescent nightclub operation. Present at DVD headquarters in Chapter 125 when Sam reports intelligence from the nightclub, weighing in during the debate about how to respond. Tacitly approves Sam and Rampart's unofficial patrol in Chapter 127 by requesting a "turkey sub." Debriefs Sam and Rampart in Chapter 128 alongside Fury Forge after their unauthorized confrontation with Jump-dealing gang members, expressing concern about possible mind control tied to Rogue Wave. Arrives at the Philadelphia Zoo at supersonic speed in Chapter 133, striking Mr. Tyrannosaur and leading the DVD reinforcements that turn the tide of the battle. Continues fighting Mr. Tyrannosaur in Chapter 134 but is ultimately knocked out, though he survives without serious injury.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at Jefferson-Frankford Hospital in Chapter 145 alongside Multiplex and Crossroads to interview Sam after Aaron McKinley sets her on fire at school. The trio conducts an official DVD inquiry into the incident, after which Sam requests a private conversation with Crossroads.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Interlude POV

    Serves as the point-of-view character in Interlude RG.1, beginning at 2:30 AM on March 13, 2025 when he wakes in a motel room. He deflects questions from reporters (including Janine from the Philadelphia Inquirer) at PICC before conducting a team briefing. Coordinates the convoy along the Pennsylvania Turnpike with federal agents Cryptid, Basilisk (maintaining an anti-ESP field), and Peregrine (aerial surveillance), with multiple decoy convoys deployed on other routes. The Kingdom ambush unfolds in waves: first Mr. Tyrannosaur emerges on the highway while Mr. Yellowjacket (Motorcycle Guy) conducts precision attacks with pressurized air bursts; then Mrs. Jellyjam (Pink Suit) hijacks a convoy truck revealing Mrs. Fulcrum (Ballerina) and a rogue SWAT agent (later revealed as Mrs. Doppelganger). Greene deduces the motorcycle attacks are pressurized air, not explosions. Mrs. Fulcrum reveals her power to flip vehicles. Greene orders his team to retreat and attempts solo defense of the convoy. Mrs. Jellyjam ambushes him from behind, suffocating him with a gelatinous substance, rendering him unconscious. Subsequently develops pneumonia from inhaling the substance. Referenced in the arc synopsis as a significant failure that enables the Kingdom's liberation of both prisoners.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Recovering from pneumonia; his absence contributes to the DVD's reduced operational capacity.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appears in Chapter 178 at DVD headquarters in civilian clothes (khakis and a blue button-down), visiting before his departure for New York on a federally sponsored NSRA assignment. Spars with Sam in a training exercise arranged by Multiplex, demonstrating the vast power gap between them as Sam's attacks fail to penetrate his electromagnetic field. During the match, he shares that his field was not always consistent and that he used to practice on freeway off-ramps in LA. Deactivates his field out of concern when Sam feigns a reopened gunshot wound, allowing Sam to land a punch with her tooth-knuckles that leaves a cut on his cheek. Acknowledges Sam's cleverness and departs Philadelphia for New York, beginning his multi-city tour to combat emerging metahuman criminal syndicates.

??? warning "Books 13-16: Burn After Reading through Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Absent from Philadelphia throughout, continuing his federally sponsored tour. Eventually reaches Los Angeles. His prolonged absence contributes to the depletion of experienced DVD personnel as the city faces escalating threats.


## Trivia

- One of the few non-protagonist characters to receive a dedicated POV interlude (RG.1).
- Asked Sam and Rampart to bring him a "turkey sub" when tacitly approving their patrol - Sam corrected him to "hoagie," reflecting his Los Angeles origins.
- Maggie references him as "the same Captain Plasma who stopped that runaway train in DC," indicating a national reputation.
- His codename aligns with his power set - plasma is the fourth state of matter, associated with ionized gas and electromagnetic fields.
- His field's properties he discussed openly during sparring, suggesting he does not consider the information a tactical vulnerability.
