??? warning "Background"

    Rodney Greene, operating under the codename Captain Plasma, is a senior member of the Delaware Valley Defenders, Philadelphia's only registered superhuman team prior to the formation of Argus Corps. As a registered superhuman entity, Greene is a federal employee whose identity is public record and who operates with legal protections equivalent to those of law enforcement officers. His role within the DVD has centered on rapid response, hostile metahuman engagement, and high-profile security operations, where his extraordinary power level makes him the team's most formidable combatant.

    Greene's most significant field operation prior to his departure from Philadelphia was the prison transport of Kingdom of Keys operatives Mr. Nothing and Mudslide on March 13, 2025. Commanding a convoy from the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center along the Pennsylvania Turnpike, Greene coordinated with federal agents Cryptid, Basilisk, and Peregrine to execute the transfer using decoy convoys and aerial surveillance. When the Kingdom launched an orchestrated ambush involving Mr. Tyrannosaur, Mrs. Fulcrum, Mr. Yellowjacket, and Mrs. Jellyjam, Greene fought to defend the convoy single-handedly, ultimately ordering his team to retreat while he held the line. He was incapacitated from behind when Mrs. Jellyjam (operating under the alias "Pink Suit") suffocated him with a gelatinous substance, leading to severe pneumonia that sidelined him for weeks.

    Following his recovery, Greene returned to active duty at DVD headquarters, where he continued to serve as a benchmark for the team's younger members. In late June or early July 2025, shortly before departing Philadelphia on a federally sponsored tour to combat the nationwide Jump and Fly crime wave, he sparred with Sam Small in a training exercise arranged by Multiplex. Greene departed first for New York and subsequently traveled to multiple cities, eventually reaching Los Angeles, where he remained as of early 2026.

??? note "Powers & Abilities"

    **PERKS Assessment**

    No official PERKS assessment on file.

    **Abilities**

    - **Electromagnetic Field Manipulation** - Greene generates and manipulates electromagnetic fields as the basis for all of his combat abilities. The field extends only millimeters from his skin but provides comprehensive, near-total protection. This single unified power source produces multiple effects that collectively place him at the top of the regional power hierarchy.
    - **Near-Invulnerability** - His electromagnetic field repels any conductive material within approximately two inches of his body. Physical strikes against him result in electrical discharge that stings the attacker. The field provides protection against conventional weapons, blunt force, and most metahuman attacks.
    - **Superhuman Strength** - Electromagnetic field manipulation augments his physical output to superhuman levels. He struck Mr. Tyrannosaur at supersonic speed during the Philadelphia Zoo battle, demonstrating force far beyond baseline human capability.
    - **Flight** - Achieves flight through electromagnetic interaction with the Earth's magnetic field. Capable of sustained, high-speed aerial movement.
    - **Superhuman Speed** - Moves at speeds sufficient to close distances almost instantaneously in combat, as demonstrated by his supersonic arrival at the zoo.
    - **Voluntary Field Deactivation** - Can consciously power down his electromagnetic field for situations involving sensitive electronics or when concern for another person's safety overrides defensive posture. This deactivation leaves him physically vulnerable.

    **Limitations**

    - The electromagnetic field extends only millimeters from Greene's skin, meaning it does not project outward as a barrier or shield for others. Its protection is exclusively self-contained.
    - The field can be bypassed by non-conductive or unconventional attack vectors. Mrs. Jellyjam's gelatinous substance circumvented the field entirely by suffocating him rather than striking him, demonstrating that the field does not protect against all threat types.
    - Inhaling foreign substances while the field is active remains a critical vulnerability; the pneumonia caused by Mrs. Jellyjam's attack required an extended recovery period.
    - His voluntary deactivation of the field, while a display of character, creates exploitable openings. Sam Small demonstrated this during their sparring match by feigning injury to trigger his concern, then striking him when his defenses dropped.
    - Despite his power level being described as around the "Alexandria" or "realistic Superman" tier, he does not operate at universe-scale threat levels. His capabilities, while extraordinary, are bounded within a regional scope.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Experienced in coordinating multi-asset security operations, including decoy convoys, aerial surveillance, and anti-ESP countermeasures. During the RG.1 prison transport, he planned the main convoy to take I-78 from Allentown to avoid populated areas while deploying multiple decoy convoys on other highways.
    - Trained in direct superhuman combat, with extensive field experience against high-tier metahuman opponents such as Mr. Tyrannosaur.
    - Possesses tactical awareness sufficient to lead convoy defense operations and coordinate with federal agents across multiple agencies.
    - Has undercover operation experience, though at least one such mission went poorly enough that he shared it as a cautionary tale with the Young Defenders.

??? warning "Personality"

    Greene is unfailingly polite, optimistic, and projects an air of calm authority in every interaction. He speaks with gentle reasoning and measured tones, approaching both allies and adversaries with a default posture of earnest helpfulness. This altruism extends to a sometimes patronizing need to assist everyone around him, a trait that manifests as paternalistic concern rather than condescension in intent but can read as the latter in practice. He prioritizes the greater good over personal desires to a fault, exemplified by his willingness to order his entire convoy team to flee while he faced the Kingdom ambush alone.

    His institutional orientation places him squarely on the side of systems, process, and sanctioned authority. He represents the established approach to superheroism -- federal employment, public identity, legal frameworks -- that Sam Small grows increasingly skeptical of as the story progresses. Despite this philosophical divide, Greene demonstrates genuine warmth toward the younger heroes he works alongside, tacitly approving Sam and Rampart's unofficial patrol by asking them to bring back a "turkey sub" (which Sam corrects to "hoagie"), and acknowledging Sam's cleverness after she outmaneuvered him in their sparring match. He balances institutional discipline with a practical understanding that rigid adherence to rules does not always serve justice.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Listed among the Delaware Valley Defenders at the post-homecoming-dance meeting in Chapter 113, where the team discusses the aftermath of Patriot's attack on Sam and prepares for congressional testimony on superhuman regulation.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Interrupts the Young Defenders' planning session in Chapter 123 to share a cautionary tale about his own failed undercover mission before Sam's Crescent nightclub operation. Present at DVD headquarters in Chapter 125 when Sam reports intelligence from the nightclub. Tacitly approves Sam and Rampart's unofficial patrol in Chapter 127 by requesting a "turkey sub." Debriefs Sam and Rampart in Chapter 128 alongside Fury Forge after their unauthorized confrontation with Jump-dealing gang members, expressing concern about possible mind control tied to Rogue Wave. Arrives at the Philadelphia Zoo at supersonic speed in Chapter 133, striking Mr. Tyrannosaur and leading the DVD reinforcements that turn the tide of the battle.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at Jefferson-Frankford Hospital in Chapter 145 alongside Multiplex and Crossroads to interview Sam after Aaron McKinley sets her on fire at school. The trio conducts an official DVD inquiry into the incident, after which Sam requests a private conversation with Crossroads.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Interlude POV

    Serves as the point-of-view character in Interlude RG.1, beginning at 2:30 AM on March 13, 2025 when he wakes in a motel room. He deflects questions from reporters (including Janine from the Philadelphia Inquirer) at PICC before conducting a team briefing. Coordinates the convoy with federal agents Cryptid, Basilisk (maintaining an anti-ESP field), and Peregrine (aerial surveillance) using decoy routes via I-78 from Allentown to avoid populated areas. The Kingdom ambush unfolds in waves: first Mr. Tyrannosaur emerges on the highway while Mr. Yellowjacket (Motorcycle Guy) conducts precision attacks with pressurized air bursts; then Mrs. Jellyjam (Pink Suit) hijacks a convoy truck revealing Mrs. Fulcrum (Ballerina) and a rogue SWAT agent (later revealed as Mrs. Doppelganger). Greene deduces the motorcycle attacks are pressurized air, not explosions. Mrs. Fulcrum reveals her power to flip vehicles. Greene orders his team to retreat and attempts solo defense of the convoy. Mrs. Jellyjam ambushes him from behind, suffocating him with a gelatinous substance, rendering him unconscious. Subsequently develops pneumonia from inhaling the substance. Referenced in the arc synopsis as a significant failure that enables the Kingdom's liberation of both prisoners.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as recovering from pneumonia. His absence from active duty contributes to the DVD's reduced operational capacity during the period of escalating Jump and Fly activity.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appears in Chapter 178 at DVD headquarters in civilian clothes, visiting before his departure for New York on a federally sponsored assignment. Spars with Sam in a training exercise arranged by Multiplex, demonstrating the vast power gap between them as Sam's attacks fail to penetrate his electromagnetic field. Deactivates his field out of concern when Sam feigns a reopened gunshot wound, allowing Sam to land a punch that draws blood. Acknowledges Sam's cleverness and departs Philadelphia for New York, beginning his multi-city tour to combat the Jump and Fly crime wave. Referenced in the arc synopsis as the benchmark against which Sam's tactical growth is measured.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in arc synopsis material. Absent from Philadelphia, continuing his federally sponsored tour.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in arc synopsis material. His continued absence from Philadelphia is noted as part of the broader depletion of experienced DVD personnel.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in arc synopsis material. Remains on federally sponsored tour, now in Los Angeles.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Still on his federally sponsored tour, currently stationed in Los Angeles. His absence from Philadelphia persists as the city faces escalating threats from Songbird and the Kingdom of Keys.


??? warning "Trivia"

    - Greene's interlude is designated RG.1, making him one of the few non-protagonist characters to receive a dedicated point-of-view chapter.
    - During their sparring match, Sam discovered that Greene's electromagnetic field repels conductive material within two inches of his body, causing electrical discharge on contact -- a detail Greene explained openly, suggesting he does not consider the information a tactical vulnerability.
    - Greene asked Sam and Rampart to bring him a "turkey sub" when tacitly approving their unauthorized patrol, prompting Sam to correct him with the Philadelphia term "hoagie," a small cultural detail that suggests Greene may not be a Philadelphia native.
    - His codename "Captain Plasma" aligns with his electromagnetic power set, as plasma is the fourth state of matter associated with ionized gas and electromagnetic fields.
    - The character reference guide describes him as being at the "Alexandria / realistic Superman tier," placing him among the most powerful heroes in the story's setting while clarifying that no characters in the world operate at universe-scale threat levels.
    - His pneumonia recovery arc parallels the broader theme of institutional superheroism's fragility -- even the most powerful hero on the team can be sidelined by a single creative attack that exploits an unconventional vulnerability.
    - During the RG.1 convoy operation, Greene woke at 2:30 AM in a motel room, establishing the unglamorous reality of high-security superhero logistics work.
    - He demonstrated analytical prowess during the ambush by correctly deducing that Mr. Yellowjacket's attacks were pressurized air bursts rather than explosions, identifying a pattern in the seemingly invisible blasts.
