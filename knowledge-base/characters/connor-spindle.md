## Background

Connor was a member of the Philly Phreaks, a gang of visually-apparent metahumans led by Amira Irshad (Patches) in South Philadelphia. The Phreaks had come under the Kingdom of Keys' influence, who "gifted" the young power-copier Deathgirl to the group and pushed its members toward increasingly aggressive crime. Growing uncomfortable with the escalation, Connor placed an anonymous tip before the Young Defenders' confrontation on South Street and actively sabotaged the Phreaks during the battle itself, ultimately helping choke Patches unconscious. He cooperated fully during interrogation, stating "three meals and a place to sleep sounds better than where I was," and was placed in detention at DVD headquarters before transferring to a diversion program.

Connor proved his loyalty to the heroes on Halloween night by escaping DVD HQ - folded into Sam's backpack - and asking to join the team. That same night he participated in the Kingdom warehouse infiltration, and when the team was discovered, he voluntarily stayed behind to fight Mudslide as a diversion. Shortly after, Councilman Davis proposed an off-the-books team that became the Auditors, with Connor as a founding member alongside Sam and Jordan. He began dating Jordan during this period, received formal martial arts training from Playback and Rampart, and became deeply integrated into the Auditors' operations - participating in stakeouts, contributing intelligence from former criminal contacts, and fighting in several key engagements.

Connor's foster situation progressed steadily through the later arcs. Crossroads managed his placement with Mary (a social worker) and Steve (a high school teacher), whose adoption was officially finalized during Arc 9. He relocated to Bucks County and retired from active vigilante work when SARA legislation passed. As of the latest chapters, Connor has completed his GED with high marks in math and is applying to community colleges for trade programs (electrician or plumbing, possibly BCCC). He maintains a long-distance relationship with Jordan.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Hypercontortionism** - Can contort and compress his body to an extreme degree, fitting into any space his head can pass through. Functions as extraordinary flexibility and compressibility rather than true elasticity. Limbs twist 180 degrees and can wrap around pillars for spider-like climbing. Sam describes his movements as having "spider-like limbs" and "circus-clown agility." His thin frame lacks surface area for sonic impact (effective against Squeal's blasts), and he is unusually light for his height (allowing Gale to carry the group).
- **Contortive Grappling** - Can wrap elongated limbs around opponents with a grip described as "a fishing net" or "human straightjacket," effective for choking and restraining targets even when they resist.

### Limitations

- Baseline human durability and strength - contortion does not grant enhanced toughness or regeneration. Has sustained cuts, bites, and twisted fingers in the field (though he pops dislocations back casually).
- Power is primarily utility-based with limited offensive capability against enhanced opponents.
- At almost seven feet tall, stealth and blending in are difficult outside of his contorted state.

### Training & Skills

- Street-level combat experience from the Philly Phreaks, supplemented by formal training from Playback (grappling) and Rampart (kicks).
- Skilled with improvised weapons (mace, flashlights, bricks).
- Intelligence-gathering through former criminal contacts - practical knowledge of Philadelphia's underworld, drug networks, and organizational patterns.
- Surveillance and infiltration specialist leveraging his contortion for tight-space stakeouts: "I can fit just about anywhere."
- Completed his GED with high marks in math.

## Personality

Connor is earnest, naive, and bluntly described as "very stupid" - bad handwriting, poor facial recognition under stress, and a tendency toward naive solutions. His intelligence limitations manifest practically but do not diminish his loyalty or willingness to put himself in harm's way. He carries lingering street toughness that contrasts with a genuine desire to do good, and has been actively working to improve his vocabulary and education. He is deeply devoted to Jordan, who serves as his primary emotional anchor.

In team settings, Connor provides levity and grounding. He has a talent for stating simple solutions the rest of the team overthinks, and his willingness to sacrifice himself demonstrates a courage that compensates for his intellectual limitations. He cited his own reform during a debate about whether people can change: "I was a supervillain, sort of. And now look at me." He is capable of unexpected backbone - standing up to Miasma on Jordan's behalf and bluntly rejecting plans he considers reckless: "This is way past 'not smart.' It's insane... I can't even shoplift from a Target."

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Jordan Westwood (Safeguard) | Romantic partner | Began dating during Arc 4. Jordan calls him "Conny," "love," "darling," and "snookums." Currently long-distance after Jordan left for MIT - a rumored breakup was actually a misunderstanding. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Teammate / Friend | Fellow Auditors co-founder. Sam's nickname for him is "string bean." Visited Sam during her hospitalization and post-courthouse recovery. |
| Amira Irshad (Patches) | Former leader | Led the Philly Phreaks. Connor helped choke her unconscious during the South Street battle. Amira called him "a fucking idiot" during interrogation. |
| Daisy Zhen (Deathgirl) | Former associate | Phreaks member "gifted" by the Kingdom. Confronted Connor directly during the courthouse attack; he begged her for peace. |
| Derek Taylor (Bloodhound II) | Teammate | Worked together during the Fly/Jump investigation and Dobson Mills. Derek's first reaction to meeting Connor: "Great. A fucking circus." |
| Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) | Teammate | Fellow Auditor. Squeezed Connor's hand supportively during discussions about his departure. |
| Tasha Reynolds (Lighthouse) | Teammate | Fellow Auditor. |
| Lily Chen (Blink) | Teammate | Without Connor around, Lily takes the title of least intelligent team member - a comedic dynamic between the two. |
| Ms. Anna Katz | CPS agent | Conducted interviews for Connor's adoption process. Already aware of their metahuman activities and genuinely assessing whether the group dynamic was positive for Connor. |
| Mary and Steve | Adoptive parents | Mary is a social worker, Steve a high school teacher. Cozy suburban home. Adoption finalized during Arc 9. |
| Miasma (Joshua Pleasants) | Teammate (former) | Adult supervision for the Auditors. Connor stood up to Miasma on Jordan's behalf and objected to his willingness to harm bystanders. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Introduced as a member of the Philly Phreaks during the South Street confrontation (Ch. 32). Described as tall, almost skeletal, fair-skinned with black hair, the most normal-looking of the group - Sam thought he would be "almost cute" if his face was not stretched too thin. Wore a purple hoodie and was visibly uneasy, avoiding eye contact. Spindle was confirmed as the anonymous tipster who warned the heroes, and acted as an active double agent during the battle: he pickpocketed Sam's adhesive spray from her utility belt, sprayed it into Pumice's eyes to blind his own teammate, stole Gale's belt fan, and ultimately choked Patches into unconsciousness alongside Puppeteer and Sam. Cooperated fully during interrogation (Ch. 34), revealing the Kingdom of Keys' influence over the Phreaks and confirming that they had "gifted" Deathgirl to the group. Pleaded guilty, saying three meals and a bed sounded better than where he had been. Clara Parker offered leniency through the DA, and he was held in detention at DVD HQ. During Liberty Belle's training week with Sam, Spinelli watched from the couch and made quips during poker. On Halloween night (Ch. 39), he escaped DVD HQ by folding himself into Sam's backpack inside her locker, riding through an entire school day before emerging at the Tacony Music Hall to ask to join the team. That same night, he participated in the Kingdom warehouse infiltration at 4547 Trenton Avenue (Ch. 40), where the team witnessed Mr. Polygraph execute an informant. Sam had to slap a hand over Spindle's mouth when he almost blew their cover whispering "wow." Gale noted that Spindle was light enough for her to carry the whole group when she normally could not. When Mudslide discovered them during the escape (Ch. 41), Connor stayed behind as a diversion, fought Mudslide near a storm drain area, sustained cuts from brick shrapnel, and sprayed mace in Mudslide's face. Mudslide threatened to rip out his teeth with a claw hammer. Connor returned at dawn, climbing through the Music Hall window battered but grinning ear to ear. Clara Parker wanted to speak with him privately afterward.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Received a new Gossamer-made costume - black with sharp accents of red - and was placed on a diversion program at Crossroads's suggestion, including probation, check-ins, and community service. Learned martial arts from Playback (grappling, including the omoplata) and Rampart (kicks). Still sleeping at DVD HQ, described as "practically part of the furniture." Councilman Davis proposed an off-the-books team (Ch. 49) - Sam, Jordan, and Spindle with Miasma as adult supervision - which became the Auditors after Miasma suggested the name (Ch. 54). Connor began dating Jordan, who gave him a peck on the cheek and called him "Conny" (Ch. 50). Connor asked to be called by his first name instead of Spindle. Listed as a "provisionary member" of the Young Defenders (he did not know what "provisional" meant). Participated in the Auditors' investigation of Kingdom-NSRA connections: conducted stakeouts from narrow spaces, took notes (stick figure doodles and badge numbers), and tried to find building owners for suspicious properties. At the Hatboro-Horsham NSRA site (Ch. 57), Jordan shielded him from Mr. Polygraph's lie-detection probing after Connor failed to recognize Polygraph without his mustache. During the subway tunnel confrontation beneath the Arch Street station (Ch. 59-60), Connor cut his thumb to be visible to Sam's blood sense, climbed pillars like a spider, hid in ceiling crevices, and used a heavy-duty flashlight to blind Mr. ESP and strike his ankles. Grappled Mudslide while shouting "Gargle my balls!" and wrestled a brick from Mudslide's grasp. Was present during Mrs. Westwood's confrontation at the Music Hall (Ch. 54), when Jordan's mother tracked them down and deadnamed Jordan; Connor silently wrapped his arms around Jordan afterward and stood up to Miasma, telling him to stop talking. During this arc it was revealed that Connor had a warrant out for his arrest and that his parents were looking for him.

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Referenced by Crossroads as having been "a great asset" ("your stick-man friend"). Visited Sam during her hospitalization as a "whirlwind of teenage energy" with a lopsided grin and a growing gadget array on his belt, bringing a handheld game console (Ch. 68). Sam ruffled his hair. Mentioned as "getting ripped" and occasionally visiting Sam about once a month while she recovered, though he was busy learning superhero work. Present at Sam's fifteenth birthday at the hospital.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Participated in the Jump/Fly investigation, reconnecting with former criminal contacts alongside Derek to gather street-level intelligence on the drug trade. Helped identify Sparkplug as a new player in the drug scene. During a Young Defenders team discussion about metahuman merchandise branding, Connor pitched "licorice scottie dogs" with the tagline "Get a bite of the action!" and struggled with clothes that did not fit his extra-long torso. He cited his own reform during a debate about whether people can change: "I was a supervillain, sort of. And now look at me." Introduced himself to Derek as "Hey, I'm Spindle! Jordan's boyfriend," to which Derek replied: "Great. A fucking circus." Hid inside Jordan's spatially expanded cardboard box during the Tioga Street sting operation against Squeal (Ch. 83), noting it was "the rare double sting operation" when they realized they were being set up. Squeal's sonic blast shattered the cardboard box and exposed the team. Connor wrapped around Squeal and a goon like a "human straightjacket" but was forced back by the sonic screams. Squeal bit Connor's arm, and Connor's fingers were twisted the wrong way during the fight, though he simply popped them back - "normal for him." Wore a sleek Young Defenders uniform. Set up surveillance cameras and microphones around Sparkplug's apartment, with Connor's ability to fit into tight spaces proving useful. Jordan and Connor were separately approached by the Tacony Titans with an alliance proposal. At the Dobson Mills battle (Ch. 86), Connor's thin frame allowed him to shrug off Squeal's sonic blasts more effectively. Derek slashed Squeal across the chest while Connor gagged him with a torn costume scrap and pinned him face-down so his screaming went into the ground. Connor stayed with Sam at the warehouse after the battle while others fled. Later helped Jordan modify Kate's wrist glove into an injector per Sam's plan. Sam and Connor observed the Sparkplug interrogation from behind a one-way mirror. Connor called pickpocketing illegal despite his own criminal past: "Sweetie, that's illegal."

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at Young Defenders briefings where he provided insider knowledge about the Phreaks. Corroborated intelligence about Deathgirl with characteristic bluntness: "Daisy is fucking bonkers." His long, bony hand and tendency to go beet red when the room looked at him were noted, and Fury Forge stifled a laugh at his expense. During a philosophical discussion about superheroes, he observed: "I don't think normal people are meant to be superheroes... there's something wrong with your brain when you get superpowers." During the Phreaks' courthouse attack (Ch. 97), Spindle was among the Young Defenders who walked away from the team split over NSRA orders, retreating into the courthouse with Crossroads rather than taking sides. When Deathgirl attacked, she confronted Spindle directly, calling him a traitor. He was terrified and begged for peace: "Daisy, please." He chased after Playback to help when Pumice was sent after him. Spindle and Playback survived the Pumice encounter with help from a mystery hero in biker gear (later revealed to be Gale/Jamila). Spindle described the encounter afterward: "Joe's no joke. Thought I was gonna end up as a human pretzel. Flew in, flung shit at Pumice like a cannon, and left." During the aftermath and recovery (Ch. 100), Connor and Jordan visited Sam at home two weeks post-attack, bringing comic books (One Piece omnibus) and gummy worms. Sam described Connor as "lanky frame," "string bean," with "lightning-fast reflexes." At the Young Defenders reorganization meeting at the end of the arc, Spindle remained on the team roster under Rampart's new leadership.

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Co-created the anonymous whistleblower website with Sam, Jordan, and Derek (Ch. 105), where Connor drafted submission guidelines while Jordan taught him about "Sequel" (SQL) databases. Present at the Tacony Music Hall when Sam and Maggie arrived fleeing Citizen Zero's power-negation field (Ch. 110), already in a defensive posture with his "limbs blurring." Committed to the Auditors' mission against Pattinson's Pals: "I'm in too. These assholes have had it coming for a long time." Suggested talking to Pattinson's Pals "superhero to superhero" at a Young Defenders briefing, described as "all seven feet of him somehow folded into a chair meant for normal-sized humans." Participated in weeks-long surveillance operations, using his ability to fit into tight spaces for stakeouts and intelligence gathering. Tracked one Pattinson's Pals member to a gay bar, prompting Jordan to say: "Nope. We're not touching that one." Described during surveillance as "like a giant praying mantis folded up in his seat, all angles and limbs." Present at the Music Hall during the rallying speech where the Auditors formally committed to taking down the Pals, and present during the Project Titan intelligence briefing from Devonte and Akilah. One of only five Young Defenders remaining at the end of the arc alongside Sam, Lily, Jason, and Amelia, and was seen stretching in a corner with Amelia/Gossamer.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the Music Hall for election night (Ch. 122), making a "saved democracy" quip and noting "not all Republicans are evil." Participated in planning for the Crescent nightclub undercover operation (Ch. 123), where he served as nearby lookout and distraction. Successfully drew a man out of his office during the operation while Sam mimed yawns behind the man's back. Mudslide recognized Connor's description during this arc - "seven feet tall, brown hair, built like a stick figure" - identifying him as "the contortionist." Connor bolted when he saw Mudslide at the nightclub, a smart move that kept him safe. Meeting with potential foster parents as managed by Crossroads (Ch. 125). Subject of the CPS visit by Ms. Anna Katz to the Tacony Music Hall (Ch. 129), where the group scrambled to hide evidence of superhero activities; Katz revealed she already knew about their affiliations, interviewed Jordan and Sam about Connor's living situation, and assured them his support system would not be disrupted. Jordan revealed to Katz that they had lied about emancipation to hide their homelessness, and Jordan's fear was that if CPS knew about their situation, they would not be considered fit to be near Connor. Sam confirmed their identities as Spindle and Bloodhound. Connor's prospective adoptive parents were revealed as Mary (social worker) and Steve (high school teacher). Connor shared his excitement with the team (Ch. 130): "gonna miss you assholes something fierce" but glad to have "actual adults looking out for me." Confirmed he never personally met the Kingdom while with the Phreaks - "Stitches" was the intermediary who brought Deathgirl in and escalated the violence. Connor said his old Phreaks contacts were all in jail. Present when Playback arrived at the Music Hall severely injured (Ch. 131) and rode with Tasha and Devonte to the hospital. During preparations for the zoo confrontation (Ch. 132), Connor suggested an anonymous tip to the cops, fit an entire egg roll in his mouth, and gave a toast: "To friends... and to hopefully not dying horribly in the near future!"

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    **Role:** Supporting

    Arrived at the Music Hall farewell party for Jordan (Ch. 177), revealing that he and Jordan had never actually broken up despite their physical separation - what had been interpreted as "it's complicated" was a misunderstanding. Connor was in an alternative school with his foster family. He brought Jordan a shoebox of their stuff. Present as Jordan handed off admin privileges to Sam and formally transferred Auditors leadership before departing for MIT via Greyhound. Connor "wailed like a baby" at Jordan's departure, alongside Sam and Jordan both crying.

## Trivia

- "Spinelli" appears to be an alias used during his time with the Phreaks rather than his legal surname, as he is consistently listed without a last name elsewhere.
- His codename "Spindle" references his contortion abilities and is evocative of the Batman villain Ragdoll.
- Connor is one of only two original Auditors (alongside Sam) who did not attend college. He is the only founding Auditor to fully retire from vigilante work.
- Prior to joining the Phreaks, Connor had a family who "ditched me like wet garbage" and survived through drug dealing and sleeping in abandoned buildings and tents.
- He may have never left the city of Philadelphia before the Auditors' investigation trips.
- Knows the Kenny Rogers reference (a poker joke during training), suggesting some familiarity with classic pop culture despite his limited education.
