## Background

Connor was a member of the Philly Phreaks, a gang of visually-apparent metahumans led by Amira Irshad (Patches) that operated in South Philadelphia. The Phreaks had come under the influence of the Kingdom of Keys, who "gifted" the young power-copier Daisy (Deathgirl) to the group and had been threatening its members into increasingly aggressive criminal behavior. Connor, operating under the codename Spindle, grew uncomfortable with Amira's escalating activities and the Kingdom's manipulation. Prior to the Young Defenders' confrontation with the Phreaks on South Street, he placed an anonymous tip warning of the planned attack, an act that Sam Small later recognized when she noticed his visible discomfort during the standoff.

During the battle on South Street, Spindle betrayed his team at a critical moment, allowing the Young Defenders to capture Patches while Deathgirl escaped. In the aftermath, Connor cooperated fully during interrogation at Delaware Valley Defenders headquarters, revealing that the Kingdom of Keys had been influencing Amira and had provided Deathgirl to the Phreaks. He stated he was willing to accept punishment if it meant escaping Amira's escalating criminal activities. Clara Parker, the DVDs' legal advisor, suggested potential leniency in exchange for his continued cooperation. He was subsequently placed in witness protection while residing at the DVD headquarters.

Connor's loyalties quickly shifted to the heroes' side. He began observing Liberty Belle's training sessions with Sam and eventually asked to join Sam and Jordan's independent operations, revealing himself by emerging from Sam's school locker on Halloween night -- a feat made possible by his contortion abilities. That same night, he participated in the team's infiltration of a Kingdom of Keys warehouse on Trenton Avenue, where they witnessed Mr. Polygraph execute a suspected informant. When the team was discovered by Mudslide during their escape, Connor volunteered to stay behind as a diversion, returning battered but alive at dawn. Shortly after Liberty Belle's death, Councilman Jamal Davis proposed an off-the-books investigation into the NSRA, with Sam, Jordan, and Connor operating as a covert team called "The Auditors."

Connor began dating Jordan Westwood during this period and became deeply integrated into the Auditors' social circle. Over the following year, he participated in multiple operations, contributed intelligence from his former criminal contacts, and gradually transitioned toward civilian life. By Arc 9, he was preparing for adoption, which was officially finalized by February 2025. He relocated to Bucks County to live with his foster/adoptive family. As of the beginning of Arc 16, Connor has completed his GED, is applying to community colleges, and maintains a long-distance relationship with Jordan.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Hypercontortionism** — Connor possesses the metahuman ability to contort and compress his body to an extreme degree, allowing him to fit into any space his head can pass through. This ability is sometimes described as "elastic" in nature, though it functions more as an extraordinary flexibility and compressibility rather than true elasticity. He has used this power to hide in school lockers, squeeze through narrow gaps in warehouses, and navigate tight spaces during infiltration missions.
- **Contortive Grappling** — Connor can wrap his elongated limbs around opponents to restrain them. During the Dobson Mills warehouse battle, he tripped Squeal by wrapping around his legs and subsequently gagged and restrained him to prevent further sonic attacks.

### Limitations

- Connor is a baseline human in terms of durability and strength; his contortion ability does not grant enhanced toughness or regeneration.
- He has been injured in the field, including sustaining cuts from brick fragments during his diversion against Mudslide.
- His power is primarily utility-based and provides limited offensive capability against opponents with enhanced strength or durability.
- At almost seven feet tall, Connor's height makes stealth and blending in difficult outside of his contorted state.

### Training & Skills

- Street-level combat experience from his time with the Philly Phreaks, including familiarity with improvised weapons (carried mace during the Kingdom warehouse escape).
- Intelligence-gathering skills developed through reconnecting with former criminal associates to collect information on drug distribution networks and Kingdom operations.
- Practical knowledge of Philadelphia's criminal underworld, including contacts and operational patterns of various organizations.
- Currently pursuing his GED and formal education, with plans to attend community college.

## Personality

Connor is earnest and somewhat naive, carrying a lingering street toughness from his years as a criminal that contrasts with his genuine desire to do good. He is described as very unintelligent -- the character reference guide bluntly notes he is "very stupid" -- but this does not diminish his loyalty or his willingness to put himself in harm's way for others. His speech features occasional slang, though he has been actively working to improve his vocabulary and education as part of his transition to civilian life. He is deeply devoted to Jordan Westwood, and their relationship serves as one of his primary emotional anchors.

In team settings, Connor provides moments of levity and grounding. During a tense strategy session about the Kingdom and Rogue Wave, he broke the tension by suggesting the group get Slurpees. During a Young Defenders philosophical debate about the ethics of power-enhancing drugs, he cited his own reform as evidence that people can change, reflecting a self-awareness about his past and a belief in second chances. His willingness to sacrifice himself -- staying behind to distract Mudslide, volunteering as lookout during dangerous operations -- demonstrates a courage that compensates for his intellectual limitations.

## Trivia

- Connor's alias "Spinelli" appears to be a surname he used during his time with the Phreaks and in early interactions with the heroes, though the character reference guide lists him without a last name, suggesting "Spinelli" may not be his legal surname.
- His codename "Spindle" references his contortion abilities and is evocative of the Batman villain Ragdoll, as noted in the character reference guide.
- At almost seven feet tall, Connor is one of the tallest characters in the story, which creates an inherent comedy in his ability to fold himself into small spaces like school lockers and backpacks.
- He hid in Sam's school locker for an entire day before revealing himself on Halloween night to ask to join the team -- a dramatic introduction that showcased both his power and his determination.
- Connor is one of only two original Auditors (alongside Sam) who did not attend college, as Jordan left for MIT. He is the only founding Auditor to fully retire from vigilante work.
- The character reference guide describes him as "very stupid," and notes that without him around, Lily Chen takes the title of least intelligent team member.
- During the Fly/Jump investigation, Deathgirl is listed as one of Connor's former criminal associates, suggesting he maintained some awareness of her whereabouts after leaving the Phreaks.
