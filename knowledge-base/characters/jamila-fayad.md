## Background

Jamila gained her wind control powers after a concussion sustained during severe plane turbulence while returning from visiting family in Iran. She had her powers for approximately one year before registering and joining the Young Defenders in 2022. An NSRA postcognitive background check confirmed her clean record, and her PERKS interviewing officer noted her Muslim faith and family as sources of moral grounding.

A core member of the Young Defenders from Arcs 1 through 6, Jamila participated in major engagements and became Sam Small's first girlfriend. Growing discomfort with the violence of superhero life - compounded by Sam's escalating danger and hospitalization - led her to break up with Sam and leave the team in mid-2024. She relocated to Chicago for college, living with her cousin Nadia, and joined the Chicago Powered Youth Initiative (CPYI) under the codename "Zephyr," performing infrastructure-focused community service rather than combat.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | E4/E/P/B |
| **Category** | Employ |
| **Power Ranking** | 4/10 |
| **Control** | 6/10 |
| **Hostility** | 1/10 |

| **Threat Level** | 4/10 |

### Abilities

- **Wind Control (Aerokinesis)** - Manipulates and controls already-moving air. Cannot generate wind from still air; requires an initial air movement of approximately 1.5 m/s to begin. Often initiates this using a small battery-powered fan clipped to her belt. Categorized as aerokinetic but not aerogenetic.
- **Air Volume Manipulation** - Can manipulate up to approximately 65 cubic meters of air, sufficient to lift herself and one additional passenger in close proximity. Maximum lift capacity of approximately 330 lbs in ideal conditions. Control is most effective as vertical columns or cylinders of swirling wind.
- **Wind Speed Generation** - Capable of generating wind speeds up to 75 MPH (Beaufort scale 12) within two inches of her skin, with a functional maximum of approximately 60 MPH (Beaufort scale 10) at usable range.
- **Directional Control** - Exhibits high precision in directing wind currents, especially effective within a 20-meter radius. Precision decreases with distance. Maximum control range of approximately 81 meters, with wind speed decreasing linearly to about 2.5 m/s at the edge.
- **Air Vortex Creation** - Can create and sustain air vortices with diameters of up to 2 meters. Limited to two simultaneous vortices, one per hand, as complex phenomena require hand-based concentration. Can also replicate small-scale meteorological phenomena such as squalls and downbursts.
- **Flight** - Uses wind control for personal flight and can carry passengers. Certified for JLUMA flight at Basic proficiency level with an altitude limit of 30 feet, restricted to daylight hours and designated flight zones.
- **Enhanced Mobility** - Leverages wind control for rapid movement, evasive maneuvers, and aerial repositioning in combat.
- **Immediate Disengagement** - Can cease wind control instantaneously upon decision, with wind speeds returning to ambient conditions within 2–3 seconds.

### Limitations

- **Initiation Requirement** - Cannot generate wind from still air; relies on a battery-powered fan clipped to her belt to create initial airflow.
- **Environmental Interference** - Effectiveness diminishes in cluttered or enclosed spaces; most effective outdoors.
- **Physical Strain** - Continuous use limited to approximately 30 minutes before fatigue overtakes control.
- **Concentration Dependency** - Distractions significantly reduce effectiveness. Complex phenomena like vortices require hand-based focus (one per hand).
- **No Pressure/Temperature Control** - Cannot manipulate air pressure, temperature, or humidity.
- **Range Degradation** - Wind speed decreases linearly with distance, reaching only 2.5 m/s at 81 meters.

### Training & Skills

- Basic self-defense training; practices archery recreationally.
- JLUMA flight certification (Basic proficiency) obtained March 2023.
- Tactical experience from Young Defenders missions, including aerial combat.

## Personality

Jamila is motherly, smothering, and deeply pacifistic, with genuine warmth rooted in her family and faith. Her sweet demeanor was noted as refreshing by her PERKS interviewing officer. She has an unexpected love of heavy metal and extreme avant-doom music - Rage Against the Machine, Deftones, and niche acts like Flenser Leviathan and Nomicon Nox - and crochets in her spare time.

Beneath the nurturing exterior is a venomous protectiveness that surfaces when loved ones are threatened (see Arc 2). Her fundamental inability to tolerate violence drove her away from the Young Defenders. She may be asexual - during the breakup she told Sam she does not feel attracted to girls, boys, or perhaps anyone, a sentiment she had expressed as early as their first confession in Arc 3. In Chicago, guilt over leaving manifests as obsessive monitoring of Philadelphia news, yet she remains paralyzed between the clean break she chose and the connection she still feels.
