## Background

Jamila Fayad gained her wind control powers after suffering a concussion during severe plane turbulence while returning from Iran. She had her powers for approximately one year before being registered as a prerequisite to joining the Young Defenders in 2022. A thorough background check, including NSRA postcognitive analysis, confirmed her clean record. Her family background and Muslim faith were noted by her PERKS interviewing officer as a source of strength and moral grounding.

Jamila served as a core member of the Young Defenders during a particularly turbulent period for the team, participating in major engagements including the South Street battle against the Philly Phreaks and the chaotic events surrounding the Chernobyl trial. During her time on the team, she developed a romantic relationship with Sam Small, becoming Sam's first girlfriend. The relationship was marked by genuine affection but also significant strain caused by Sam's escalating involvement in dangerous situations and extended hospitalization.

In mid-2025, during a team meeting where the Young Defenders discussed their futures, Jamila announced her desire to step back from active duty, citing the increasing violence and her fear of losing her life. She broke up with Sam around the same time and subsequently disappeared from the team and Sam's life. She later resurfaced in Chicago, where she had moved for college and to maintain the family homestead while her parents and extended family were in Pakistan for religious and professional reasons. She joined the Chicago Powered Youth Initiative (CPYI), an infrastructure-focused organization that puts superpowered youth to work on infrastructure projects rather than combat or search and rescue operations, operating under the new codename "Zephyr." In Chicago, she assists with lakefront storm barrier support at Navy Pier, demonstrating precision wind control that earns the approval of Whiteout, a professional Chicago superhero. She is coordinated by Nour, the CPYI coordinator. Despite her new life, Jamila obsessively watches footage of Sam's beating by Rush Order, struggles with guilt over abandoning Philadelphia and Sam, and is urged by her brother Ahmed to contact Sam after the incident. She contemplates reaching out but remains uncertain, torn between her decision to make a "clean break" and her unresolved feelings.

Despite her departure, Jamila returned one final time during the courthouse crisis, arriving disguised in biker gear and a helmet to help Playback and Spindle subdue Pumice when civilians were in danger.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | E4/E/P/B |
| **Category** | Employ |
| **Power Ranking** | 4/10 |
| **Control** | 6/10 |
| **Hostility** | 1/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 5/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 4/10 |

### Abilities

- **Wind Control (Aerokinesis)** — Manipulates and controls already-moving air. Cannot generate wind from still air; requires an initial air movement of approximately 1.5 m/s to begin. Often initiates this using a small battery-powered fan clipped to her belt. Categorized as aerokinetic but not aerogenetic.
- **Air Volume Manipulation** — Can manipulate up to approximately 65 cubic meters of air, sufficient to lift herself and one additional passenger in close proximity. Maximum lift capacity of approximately 330 lbs in ideal conditions. Control is most effective as vertical columns or cylinders of swirling wind.
- **Wind Speed Generation** — Capable of generating wind speeds up to 75 MPH (Beaufort scale 12) within two inches of her skin, with a functional maximum of approximately 60 MPH (Beaufort scale 10) at usable range.
- **Directional Control** — Exhibits high precision in directing wind currents, especially effective within a 20-meter radius. Precision decreases with distance. Maximum control range of approximately 81 meters, with wind speed decreasing linearly to about 2.5 m/s at the edge.
- **Air Vortex Creation** — Can create and sustain air vortices with diameters of up to 2 meters. Limited to two simultaneous vortices, one per hand, as complex phenomena require hand-based concentration. Can also replicate small-scale meteorological phenomena such as squalls and downbursts.
- **Flight** — Uses wind control for personal flight and can carry passengers. Certified for JLUMA flight at Basic proficiency level with an altitude limit of 30 feet, restricted to daylight hours and designated flight zones.
- **Enhanced Mobility** — Leverages wind control for rapid movement, evasive maneuvers, and aerial repositioning in combat.
- **Immediate Disengagement** — Can cease wind control instantaneously upon decision, with wind speeds returning to ambient conditions within 2–3 seconds.

### Limitations

- **Initiation Requirement** — Power is entirely dependent on the presence of moving air. Still air renders her unable to initiate wind control. She relies on a battery-powered fan to create initial airflow.
- **Environmental Interference** — Effectiveness diminishes in complex, cluttered, or enclosed spaces. Powers are most effective outdoors.
- **Physical Strain** — Extended use causes fatigue equivalent to moderate-intensity physical activity. Functional upper limit of approximately 30 minutes of continuous usage before fatigue overtakes her ability to sustain winds.
- **Concentration Dependency** — Wind control is closely tied to concentration. Distractions or divided attention significantly reduce control effectiveness. Complex phenomena like vortices require hand-based focus, limiting her to one vortex per hand.
- **No Pressure/Temperature Control** — Control extends only to wind speed and direction. She cannot manipulate air pressure, temperature, or humidity.
- **Range Degradation** — Maximum wind speed decreases linearly with distance, reaching only 2.5 m/s at the 81-meter edge of her range.

### Training & Skills

- Basic self-defense training, described as knowing enough to be dangerous to a random person on the street.
- Practices archery recreationally.
- JLUMA flight certification (Basic proficiency) obtained in March 2023.
- Tactical experience from coordinated missions with the Young Defenders, including aerial combat and team-based engagements.

## Personality

Jamila is motherly, smothering, and deeply pacifistic. She shows genuine warmth and care for those around her, often going out of her way to comfort and support her teammates. She has an unexpected interest in heavy metal music, particularly bands from the 2000s, and enjoys attending her brothers' metal band concerts. Her sweet demeanor and earnest approach were noted as refreshing by her PERKS interviewing officer, and her empathetic nature and strong ethical values are rooted in her family and faith.

Beneath her nurturing exterior, Jamila possesses a venomous side that emerges when people she cares about are threatened, as demonstrated when she used her wind powers to physically lift Puppeteer during the confrontation where Puppeteer assaulted Sam. However, her fundamental inability to tolerate violence ultimately drove her away from the Young Defenders. She still harbors feelings for Sam but chose to end their relationship rather than continue to be part of a world she found increasingly unbearable. Her stated claim of being asexual was made to soften the breakup; she is heterosexual but has stringent taste in men and had genuinely cared for Sam. In Chicago, her guilt manifests as obsessive monitoring of Philadelphia news and Sam's public appearances, particularly after the Rush Order beating, yet she cannot bring herself to make contact, paralyzed between the clean break she chose and the connection she still feels.
