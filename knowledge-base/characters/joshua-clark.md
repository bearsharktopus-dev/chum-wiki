## Background

Joshua Clark is an eighteen-year-old metahuman operating in Northeast Philadelphia under the alias Sandman. He serves as the second-in-command of the Tacony Titans, a young vigilante team led by Sundial that patrols the Tacony and surrounding neighborhoods. The Tacony Titans were first referenced by Sam Small's school friends in September 2023, when Lilly Rodriguez mentioned her father had encountered the local team. At that time, the Titans' roster included Bubble, Compass, Weave, Sandman, and Sundial. By the time the Auditors formally encountered the Titans in late April 2024, the team had shifted membership, with Moonshot replacing Weave.

Joshua comes from an upper-middle-class household with parents described as "Blunt Black Academic" types who emphasized intellectual rigor and educational achievement. This upbringing instilled in him a voracious reading habit and a sharp analytical mind, both of which he channels into the team's tactical operations. His natural resistance to unconsciousness grants him extended waking hours, which he uses to read extensively and serve as the Titans' overnight sentry, keeping their base secure during the hours when the rest of the team sleeps. He also functions as the team's primary financial backer, using his family's resources to fund their operations.

Physically, Joshua is described as scrawny with short dreadlocks. Despite his slight build, he has proven himself a capable field operative through creative applications of his sleep-manipulation powers, most notably his ability to control the movements of sleeping bodies -- including directing the werewolf Derek Taylor during combat operations by riding on his back and puppeteering his unconscious form.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Somnipathy (Sleep-Body Manipulation)** -- Can manipulate the bodily movements of sleeping people, effectively puppeteering their physical actions while they remain unconscious. This power extends to any sleeping individual within his range, allowing him to direct their movements with precision sufficient for coordinated combat.
- **Self-Somnambulism** -- Can manipulate his own body while asleep, enabling him to remain physically active and functional even during periods of unconsciousness.
- **Unconsciousness Resistance** -- Possesses a natural resistance to being rendered unconscious, whether through fatigue, sedation, or external forces. This allows him to maintain extended periods of wakefulness far beyond normal human limits.

### Limitations

- Joshua's combat applications are dependent on the availability of sleeping subjects to manipulate; without them, his offensive capability is significantly reduced.
- His scrawny physical build offers no enhanced durability or strength, making him vulnerable in direct physical confrontations.
- The precise range and upper limit of subjects he can simultaneously control are not documented.
- Specific conditions required for his power to function (e.g., whether targets must be in natural sleep versus drug-induced unconsciousness) are not established in the narrative.

### Training & Skills

- Extensively self-educated through marathon reading sessions enabled by his resistance to unconsciousness, giving him a broad base of knowledge applicable to tactical planning and strategic analysis.
- Serves as the Tacony Titans' primary tactician and strategic planner, working closely with Sundial to coordinate team operations.
- Experienced in surveillance and sentry duty, having conducted solo overnight watches of the Titans' base as well as external locations such as Sam Small's neighborhood during the Aaron McKinley arson crisis.
- Capable of disguise and covert observation, as demonstrated when he posed as a homeless person to monitor Sam's street undetected.

## Personality

Joshua is sarcastic and sharp-tongued, serving as the Tacony Titans' resident cynic. He speaks with a dry, cutting wit and does not shy away from blunt assessments of situations or people. Despite this abrasive exterior, he is deeply protective of his teammates and genuinely committed to the Titans' mission of defending their neighborhood. He occupies a role within the team that has been compared to Batman -- the intellectual without the flashiest powers who compensates with preparation, funding, and tactical acumen.

He struggles with moral dilemmas related to his powers, particularly the ethical implications of controlling other people's bodies without their conscious consent. This tension between utility and ethics is a recurring undercurrent in his characterization. When the Argus Corps' Safer Streets Initiative began targeting underage heroes with bounties, Joshua was among those who suggested standing down entirely, reflecting a pragmatic streak that sometimes conflicts with the more action-oriented members of both the Titans and the Auditors. He is book-smart and tactical, and his extended waking hours give him an unusual perspective -- he is often the one watching while everyone else sleeps, a solitary role that reinforces both his value to the team and his emotional distance from it.
