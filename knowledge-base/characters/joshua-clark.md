## Background

Joshua Clark is an eighteen-year-old metahuman and second-in-command of the Tacony Titans, a young vigilante team led by Sundial patrolling Northeast Philadelphia. He comes from an upper-middle-class household with parents described as "Blunt Black Academic" types who emphasized intellectual rigor. This upbringing instilled a voracious reading habit and sharp analytical mind that he channels into tactical operations. His resistance to unconsciousness grants him extended waking hours, which he uses to read extensively and serve as the Titans' overnight sentry. He also functions as the team's primary financial backer.

Physically, Joshua has dark skin and floppy dreadlocks with a slight build. He is frequently described as appearing perpetually sleepy, often on the verge of dozing off.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Somnipathy (Sleep-Body Manipulation)** - Can manipulate the bodily movements of sleeping people, effectively puppeteering their physical actions while they remain unconscious. This power extends to any sleeping individual within his range, allowing him to direct their movements with precision sufficient for coordinated combat.
- **Self-Somnambulism** - Can manipulate his own body while asleep, enabling him to remain physically active and functional even during periods of unconsciousness.
- **Unconsciousness Resistance** - Possesses a natural resistance to being rendered unconscious, whether through fatigue, sedation, or external forces. This allows him to maintain extended periods of wakefulness far beyond normal human limits.

### Limitations

- Joshua's combat applications are dependent on the availability of sleeping subjects to manipulate; without them, his offensive capability is significantly reduced.
- His slight physical build offers no enhanced durability or strength, making him vulnerable in direct physical confrontations.
- The precise range and upper limit of subjects he can simultaneously control are not documented.
- Specific conditions required for his power to function (e.g., whether targets must be in natural sleep versus drug-induced unconsciousness) are not established in the narrative.

### Training & Skills

- Self-educated through marathon reading sessions; broad knowledge base applicable to tactical planning.
- Primary tactician and strategic planner for the Titans, working closely with Sundial.
- Experienced in surveillance and sentry duty; capable of disguise and covert observation.

## Personality

Joshua is sarcastic and sharp-tongued, the Tacony Titans' resident cynic. He speaks with a dry, cutting wit and does not shy away from blunt assessments. Despite this abrasive exterior, he is deeply protective of his teammates. Often compared to "the Batman of the team" - the intellectual without the flashiest powers who compensates with preparation, funding, and tactical acumen.

He struggles with the ethical implications of controlling other people's bodies without their conscious consent. This tension between utility and ethics is a recurring undercurrent in his characterization. He has a pragmatic streak that sometimes conflicts with more action-oriented members - his solitary overnight watches reinforce both his value to the team and his emotional distance from it.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    The Tacony Titans are first referenced in Chapter 17 when Sam's school friends research local superheroes during a sleepover at Kate Smith's apartment. Marcus Johnson finds the Titans' fan-made website on NetSphere, and Lilly Rodriguez mentions that her father met the team and received pre-packaged food from them. Sandman is listed as a team member alongside Bubble, Compass, Weave, and Sundial on the Titans' basic website, with his abilities listed as speculative.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    The Tacony Titans are encountered by Sam and Jordan during a patrol in Wissinoming Park in Chapter 70, though only Bubble and Sundial appear on-page. The team is formally introduced as an operating unit in Northeast Philadelphia. Appears on-page for the first time during the alliance formation meeting at the Tacony Titans' garage headquarters in Chapter 80, where he introduces his power: "I can control people and animals while they're sleeping. Including myself." During the Dobson Mills operation, Sandman initially stays behind at the garage to manage operations remotely, directing the combined team via comms from HQ. He then arrives at the warehouse in Chapter 81, riding on Derek's tranquilized werewolf form - an arrangement they had planned roughly a week in advance. Together with Derek, he takes down an iron-skinned goon and then helps defeat Squeal alongside Spindle. After Kate Smith's injuries in Chapter 82, Sandman slips away with Jordan and Derek before paramedics arrive, as they cannot risk being seen without licenses. In Chapter 83, he joins the combined team strategy session, notably appearing to be on the verge of passing out throughout the meeting. In Chapter 84, he assists with the Sparkplug takedown at the Dorchester penthouse, evacuating civilians from neighboring units alongside Jordan - including directing a sleeping man to run after them using his powers - while Sam and Derek confront Sparkplug directly.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the planning meeting in Devonte's hospital room following the shooting, where heroes discuss the Kingdom's planned zoo heist - Operation Ivory (Chapter 131). Slips out with Sundial at the end of the meeting, murmuring about patrol schedules and equipment needs. In Chapter 132, accompanies Sam to introduce her to Razor (Rashad Jackson) in an alley behind Geno's Grocery, vouching for Sam's intel about the Kingdom's plans. Calls Sam "Bee" and displays his characteristically sleepy demeanor.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Assigned by the Tacony Titans to watch Sam's neighborhood during the Aaron McKinley arson crisis. Sundial offers to send Sandman to keep watch on Sam's block (Chapter 140). Appears in Chapter 141 disguised as a homeless person with a scraggly fake beard and a beanie over his dreadlocks, conducting covert surveillance of Sam's street. He has a phone with a battery pack, food, and fifteen documentaries to pass the time, and tells Sam he's "done this like thirty times." Interacts briefly with Sam when she returns home, maintaining his watch. In Chapter 142, his blanket bundle has been relocated but he is presumably still in the area. Continues guarding the neighborhood in Chapter 143, where Sam nods at him and he cracks an eye open to nod back. Encounters Sam near her house after she escapes the hospital in Chapter 146, engaging her in an intense discussion about her motivations regarding Aaron. His real name is revealed in narration during this scene ("Joshua's tone"). Challenges Sam directly - "Stopped? Or punished?" - and warns that "Pain doesn't teach them lessons. It just makes them worse." Ultimately concedes with "You're a stubborn little shit" when Sam refuses to stand down.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in Chapter 184 when Sundial reports to Sam that Sandman has suggested the Titans stand down for a few weeks in response to Argus Corps' Safer Streets Initiative and its bounties for reporting powered youth. Compass is also talking about going underground.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in Auditors group chat messages relayed through Lily Chen. In Chapter 198, Sandman is reported to be monitoring transport hubs on behalf of the Titans. In Chapter 201, Sandman reports that the Titans spotted a tall figure (later identified as Shrike) on a school roof in Rhawnhurst, noting that the figure moved "unnaturally fast" - not speedster fast, but as if they knew exactly where they were going.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Part of the Tacony Titans' storm response during the Maya Richardson-engineered blizzard that dumps sixteen inches of snow on Northeast Philadelphia (Chapter 229). While the other Titans are in the field - Moonshot sweeping the Cottman corridor, Compass and Bubble handling residential check-ins - Sandman coordinates from the Titans' base. The team is overwhelmed with search-and-rescue operations and unable to address the coordinated Kingdom break-ins, prompting Sundial to request Auditors assistance and establish a joint communication channel.


## Trivia

- His codename "Sandman" references the folkloric figure associated with sleep.
- The Titans' original roster included a member called "Weave" who was replaced by Moonshot between Chapter 17 and Chapter 80.
- As of the beginning of Arc 16 (February 2026), his status is described simply as "presumably working and handling school."
