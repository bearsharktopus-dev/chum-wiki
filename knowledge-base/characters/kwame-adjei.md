## Background

Kwame Adjei is a Ghanaian immigrant who operates as Bulwark, a senior member of the Delaware Valley Defenders. He comes from a construction background and emigrated from an oppressive political environment, experiences that instilled a deep reverence for the rule of law. He stands approximately 6'7" with a build like an old-timey circus strongman, yet possesses a gentle demeanor, and speaks with a heavy Ghanaian accent, notably avoiding compound words entirely in his speech.

Bulwark serves as a core field operative alongside Multiplex and Fury Forge, occupying a temperamental middle ground between Forge's impulsiveness and Multiplex's rigidity. He contributed to the original DVD Training Curriculum (July 2016), where his construction background informed his focus on leverage over pure strength. He has maintained a consistent presence throughout the story as a reliable senior hero in briefings, crisis response, and field operations, and was seriously injured during the Shrike crisis in Arc 14.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Granite Generation** - Bulwark can deposit a half-inch-thick layer of granite onto any object or surface by touching it, including his own body. This effectively creates a stone shell or coating over the target.
- **Self-Armoring** - When Bulwark coats himself in granite, he gains significant protective armoring. The granite does not impede his movement or flexibility, allowing him to fight unencumbered despite being encased in stone. The armor features narrow slits for eyes, nostrils, and mouth. When the armor's duration expires, it decomposes completely - crumbling from gravel to smaller bits to dust to nothing.
- **Weapon Enhancement** - By coating blunt objects in granite, Bulwark increases their mass substantially. Because the granite is weightless to him, he can swing these heavier weapons at the same speed as their uncoated counterparts, dramatically increasing their striking force. During his battle with Mr. T-Rex, he used improvised weapons including a car bumper mace and a granite-coated manhole cover.
- **Layer Stacking** - Bulwark can apply multiple layers of granite to the same object or surface, compounding thickness and weight. Each additional layer halves the remaining duration.

### Limitations

- Granite coating has a base duration of one hour per layer. Stacking halves remaining duration with each application, creating diminishing returns - three layers against Mr. T-Rex left roughly fifteen minutes of armor.
- The granite carries normal weight for anyone other than Bulwark. Allies cannot easily move objects he has coated, and armored civilians or teammates would be burdened by the additional mass.
- Bulwark's granite armor proved ineffective against electrical attacks; during the Temple University riot, electricity from a seizing Jumphead passed through his stone coating as though it were not there.
- Bulwark was seriously injured during Shrike's escape at the Van Kirk construction site, indicating that his granite armor has limits against sufficiently powerful or unconventional attacks.

### Training & Skills

- Experienced field combatant. Fights from a boxing stance, sometimes modified with a weapon arm held horizontal and the other hand vertical.
- Skilled in improvised weapon use - weaponizes everyday objects like car bumpers and manhole covers (Ch. 28-29).
- Conducts independent investigative fieldwork in civilian clothes (Ch. 214).

## Personality

Kwame is calm, measured, and deeply principled, serving as the emotional center of the adult DVD. He frequently addresses younger heroes as "young one," reflecting his paternal warmth toward the next generation.

Beneath his composed exterior, Kwame harbors genuine frustration with the limitations of due process. His immigrant background gives him bone-deep reverence for the rule of law, which makes institutional failures all the more galling - he has pushed for action against the Kingdom when he felt the team was "hiding behind legalities" (Ch. 125). His instincts remain fundamentally protective and compassionate, and he consistently advocates for recruiting fresh perspectives into the team.

## Relationships

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Mentioned only via his locker at the Delaware Valley Defenders headquarters when Sam first tours the facility in Chapter 5.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First on-page appearance in Chapter 15, arriving with the adult Defenders to assess drone footage of a Kingdom of Keys murder. Described as 6'7" with a build like an old-timey circus strongman, deep brown skin that hints blue in certain light, wearing a construction-themed costume. Gentle despite his massive stature, he put a calming hand on Fury Forge's shoulder and tried to comfort Sam (who jerked away). His single-word reaction to the footage was "Grim."

    Major role in Chapters 28-29: arrives just in time to save Sam from being crushed by Mr. T-Rex's foot, strong enough to shove the dinosaur's foot back and topple it. Created an improvised mace by ripping off a car bumper, bending it into a handle shape, and armoring it with granite. Locked T-Rex's mouth in stone around a neighbor's doorframe and landed blows to the dinosaur's eyes, bruising and possibly blinding one. Threw an armored manhole cover shot-put style with stone layers added mid-flight. In the final exchange, punched T-Rex's damaged eye head-on while absorbing a snout hit to his torso that cracked his armor throughout. Mr. T-Rex retreated but was not captured, and Bulwark alerted other heroes to intercept.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Described in Chapter 37 as showing a "hint of concern, masked by stoic reserve" when Belle briefed the team on the Chernobyl threat. Openly sobbing when Liberty Belle revealed her terminal cancer diagnosis in Chapter 34, one of the few adult heroes shown weeping at the news. Present at the gathering after Belle's death at the PES refinery, his large frame casting a long shadow as East Coast heroes from Atlantic City, Camden, Trenton, DC, and NYC convened to mourn.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Supporting

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the joint hero meeting at DVD headquarters in Chapter 85, alongside the full Young Defenders, Delaware Valley Defenders, and Bubble representing the Tacony Titans. During the Rogue Wave analysis, Bulwark suggested the organization's goal may be chaos and destabilization rather than simply building an army, describing them as an "anarchist sect" that "seeks to create chaos for its own sake." When Rampart asked whether Rogue Wave were terrorists or ideologues, Bulwark replied that "the line is much thinner than we would like."

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Supporting

    In interlude BA.1 (Fury Forge's POV), expresses concern for Sam's well-being and articulates the core recruitment proposal - opening a new eligibility cycle for the Young Defenders while also bringing in outside talent. Serves as voice of moderation, defusing tensions between Fury Forge and Multiplex. At the Ch. 91 DVD/YD briefing, says he would be "surprised if there was NOT a supervillain conspiracy" behind the Jump incidents. Sides with Multiplex in Ch. 97 on following NSRA suppression orders at the courthouse protests, clashing with Sam and Playback before the Phreaks' attack interrupts.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at DVD headquarters in Chapter 125 when Sam reports on her undercover Crescent nightclub mission. During the heated debate about Sam's reckless actions and the intelligence she gathered, Bulwark pushed for action, accusing the team of "hiding behind legalities."

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Arrives at the Van Kirk construction site alongside Fury Forge and Blink during the final Shrike confrontation. After Sam captures Shrike, a skinhead's gunshot triggers chaos - Shrike breaks free, uses a Hypeman autoinjector, and generates massive spike fields. Bulwark goes down during the rampage and is placed in intensive care (stable condition). Fury Forge is treated and released on crutches.

    Major role in Chapter 214. Sam encounters him near Temple University during her EMT shift; he is in civilian clothes investigating tainted Jump distribution, intervening in a three-way confrontation between a Community Watch group, the Songbirds, and a seizing teenage Jumphead. Sam disarms an armed man circling behind him by kicking concrete at the man's shoulder. Bulwark's stone armor proves ineffective against the Jumphead's phantom electricity, which passes through granite as though it were not there. Afterward, briefs Sam on tainted Jump appearing across Philadelphia - the Kingdom is intercepting Rogue Wave shipments, modifying the compound, and releasing it to street distributors to undercut Rogue Wave's market share. Also briefs Sam on the Songbirds: masked people picking fights with superheroes and filming for propaganda.

## Trivia

- His speech pattern of avoiding compound words entirely is a distinctive linguistic trait - he would say "fire truck" rather than "firetruck," for example.
- His costume has a construction site theme: a high-visibility vest over an orange athletic tee that strains over his muscular build, black slacks, armored boots, and a utility belt with tools.
- Fury Forge's BA.1 narration describes his features as "obsidian," "sun-carved," and "craggy," and his voice as a "rich baritone" with his Ghanaian accent "rolling through the syllables like a lazy summer breeze."
