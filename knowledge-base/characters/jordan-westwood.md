## Background

Jordan Westwood grew up in the Tacony neighborhood of Philadelphia under the care of a neglectful and abusive mother. Their home life was marked by chronic neglect, including being forgotten on birthdays and left without food. Jordan's powers manifested during a traumatic childhood incident in which they were accidentally locked in a car trunk and nearly died, the extreme duress triggering their spatial manipulation abilities for the first time. Their mother responded to these abilities with disgust, calling Jordan a "freak" and a "monster," and CPS was involved at some point during Jordan's upbringing.

Jordan adopted the alias Safeguard, naming themselves after an antagonist from the manga "BLAME!" They first appeared in the story as a mysterious figure in a black cloak and white motorcycle helmet who warped the interior of a Walgreens during Sam Small's first patrol with the Young Defenders in August 2023. After Sam identified Jordan as a fellow student at Tacony Charter Academy High School, Jordan proposed that the two stage fake superhero fights to gain public notoriety. While scouting a location for their planned performance at the abandoned Dobson Textile Factory, they accidentally witnessed members of the Kingdom of Keys force Mudslide to murder a captive. Both barely escaped with their lives, and the shared trauma forged a genuine partnership.

Following the factory incident, Jordan and Sam established a headquarters in the abandoned Tacony Music Hall in Tacony, Philadelphia, where Jordan also began living to escape their mother's home. They co-founded the Auditors, a small investigative team dedicated to exposing the Kingdom of Keys and confronting government corruption. Jordan served as the team's primary technical specialist, handling intelligence analysis, electronic surveillance, digital infrastructure, and strategic planning. Their abusive mother tracked them to the Music Hall on two separate occasions, the second resulting in a permanent severing of their relationship after Jordan confronted their mother about years of neglect. Jordan received a full scholarship to MIT and departed Philadelphia for the university's summer program, transferring leadership of the Auditors to Sam. At MIT, Jordan began interning at the Department of Applied Anomalous Sciences, a government think tank that studies metahuman abilities, where their supervisor Dr. Famiglietti praised them for having "exceptional intuition for spatial dynamics." Jordan's unique ability to duplicate sealed rooms made them an invaluable research asset, allowing scientists to precisely measure what happens when AOM (Anomalously Originated Material) is created and destroyed in controlled environments. Jordan was published as fourth author on a groundbreaking preprint paper proposing the "quantum mirage" theory of AOM - the hypothesis that superhuman powers create material by overlaying quantum-entangled copies of nearby matter molecule by molecule, frame by frame, rather than generating genuinely new mass. Jordan was considering switching their major from Computer Science to Dynology, or pursuing a dual major, driven by their growing fascination with the science of superhuman abilities.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file. Jordan does not hold a LUMA (License to Utilize Metahuman Abilities) and has historically denied having powers when confronted by authorities. NSRA agents connected reports of a vigilante called "Safeguard" to Jordan but were unable to obtain proof.

### Abilities

- **Spatial Manipulation (Enclosed Spaces)** - Can manipulate the spatial dimensions within enclosed spaces, either expanding them by duplicating the space or compressing them by "cutting" the space. Compressed space re-appears when Jordan deactivates their powers. Objects duplicated by the expansion effect tend to dissolve into ash over time.
- **Multi-Region Control** - Can maintain spatial manipulation across up to three distinct regions simultaneously.
- **Living Being Exclusion** - Jordan's powers inherently ignore living beings, meaning spatial compression and expansion do not directly harm people. However, environmental effects of the manipulation (such as collapsing structures or shifting concrete) can still cause indirect harm.
- **Spatial Compression Combat Applications** - Can compress space to sever structural elements (demonstrated by compressing space to sever a staircase and drop an opponent), block escape routes, and create tactical advantages in enclosed environments. Compressed space can disintegrate inanimate objects caught within it (demonstrated when a thrown can dissolved into ash).
- **Spatial Expansion Utility** - Can expand the interior of small spaces to create hidden areas, such as turning a cardboard box into a concealed observation post large enough for multiple people to hide inside.
- **AOM Research Applications** - Jordan's spatial expansion creates measurable AOM in laboratory conditions, making them uniquely valuable to DAAS. When Jordan expands a sealed chamber, objects within it are duplicated exactly, though these duplicates vanish if jostled too hard. Scientists can measure everything about the extra space and the duplicated objects, providing controlled data on AOM behavior that is otherwise extremely difficult to obtain, since most AOM (fire, force fields, etc.) is not easily placed under a microscope.
- **Distance Manipulation** - Can manipulate perceived and actual distance within their field of effect, making running toward or away from them ineffective within an enclosed area.
- **Lock Manipulation** - Demonstrated the ability to open padlocks and locks using spatial manipulation (described as using a "wave rake"), suggesting fine-scale control over small enclosed mechanisms.

### Limitations

- **Enclosed Spaces Only** - Powers function only within enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces. Open-air environments appear to limit or negate Jordan's abilities.
- **Three-Region Limit** - Cannot manipulate more than three spatial regions at once.
- **Living Being Exclusion** - Cannot directly affect living organisms with spatial manipulation, limiting offensive applications to environmental and structural manipulation.
- **No LUMA** - Operates without legal authorization to use metahuman abilities, placing them at constant legal risk.

### Training & Skills

- Exceptional computer science and technical aptitude, sufficient to earn a full scholarship to MIT. Published as fourth author on a physics paper while still a freshman, working under Dr. Famiglietti at DAAS. Considering switching to Dynology or dual-majoring.
- Proficient in electronic surveillance, counter-surveillance, and digital security. Built homemade bug-detection devices, set up Faraday cages, established encrypted communications, and defended against DDoS attacks on the Auditors' whistleblower website.
- Skilled investigator with expertise in open-source intelligence, public records analysis, financial forensics, and social engineering. Identified shell company networks linking the Kingdom of Keys to legitimate businesses and government entities.
- Competent in basic lockpicking, which they taught to Sam and Spindle.
- Drone operation experience through their friend Alex.
- Proficient in data encryption and decryption, including working with pirated biochemistry software to partially decrypt Kingdom USB drives.

## Personality

Jordan is witty, sarcastic, and deeply intellectual, frequently referencing obscure anime and peppering their speech with pop culture allusions and technical jargon. They approach problems analytically and maintain emotional distance through humor, rarely allowing vulnerability to surface. They would never describe themselves as a "superhero," preferring to frame their work in practical, anti-establishment terms. Jordan is fiercely loyal to those within their inner circle but guards that loyalty behind layers of deflection and banter.

Despite their intellectual confidence, Jordan struggles with impostor syndrome at MIT, admitting to Sam that they keep waiting for "the other shoe to drop" and for someone to figure out they do not belong there and escort them off campus. When asked directly if they were happy, Jordan responded tentatively that they thought they were, a notable admission for someone who deflects most emotional vulnerability through humor. They described the work as interesting, the people as "mostly not assholes," and their own lab space - a closet, but their closet - as a point of quiet pride.

Beneath the sardonic exterior, Jordan carries significant emotional weight from years of parental abuse and neglect. They struggled with guilt after Sam was hospitalized following the Chernobyl fight, avoiding visiting for months before admitting they felt unable to face Sam's injuries. Jordan has described Sam as a sibling and credited Sam's influence as transformative in their life. Their relationship with authority is deeply skeptical, informed both by their mother's failures and by witnessing government complicity with criminal organizations. Despite this, Jordan has demonstrated a pragmatic willingness to collaborate with institutions when the situation demands it, as shown by their acceptance of the DAAS internship and their cooperation with Agent Torres.

    **Role:** Interlude (JW.2)

    Text conversation between Jordan and Sam. Jordan excitedly announces their co-authorship (fourth author) on a preprint paper proposing the "quantum mirage" theory of AOM - that superhuman powers create material by overlaying quantum-entangled copies of nearby matter frame by frame, and AOM dissolves not through decay but by the overlay ceasing to be maintained. Jordan explains the science to Sam using movie frame and photograph analogies, describing how AOM "telefrags" (overwrites) existing matter in place rather than displacing or transmuting it, and how this resolves the longstanding air chamber paradox in AOM research. Jordan references a teenage girl with laser eyes who worked with DAAS as a prior research subject, and mentions the "vermiform appendage" that likely mediates AOM creation in all superhumans. Jordan reveals they are considering switching their major from Computer Science to Dynology or dual-majoring, admits to impostor syndrome at MIT while tentatively acknowledging happiness, and describes their own lab space. Jordan mentions Dr. Famiglietti's praise and Dr. Harris guest-lecturing at MIT and remembering Sam fondly. Jordan notes Sam is "getting better at opsec" after Sam deflects questions about a city councilwoman's alibi manufacturing operation being exposed. The two plan to hang out during summer break, possibly with Connor. Jordan mentions Connor's foster family being "really protective, in a good way." Sam mentions her ankle monitor recently came off. The conversation ends with mutual affection and purple heart emojis.
