## Background

Jordan Westwood grew up in Tacony, Philadelphia under a neglectful and abusive mother. Their home life was defined by chronic neglect - forgotten birthdays, no food in the house, and paying for their own meals since age thirteen. Their powers manifested when they were locked in a car trunk as a child and nearly suffocated, the extreme duress triggering spatial manipulation for the first time. Their mother did not notice the incident until weeks later. Jordan spent time in foster care before returning to their mother's custody.

Under the alias Safeguard - named after an antagonist from the manga "BLAME!" - Jordan debuted as a costumed figure who warped the interior of a Walgreens during Sam Small's first patrol in August 2023. Sam identified Jordan at school by their platform boots, and the two struck a deal to stage fake hero-villain fights for notoriety. Their first planned performance at the Dobson Textile Factory went sideways when they witnessed a Kingdom of Keys initiation murder, an event that permanently transformed their relationship from adversarial to allied. Jordan subsequently moved into the abandoned Tacony Music Hall, converted it into a functional headquarters, and co-founded the Auditors with Sam - a small investigative team targeting the Kingdom and government corruption. Jordan served as the team's primary technical specialist, handling intelligence analysis, surveillance, digital infrastructure, and strategic planning.

Two confrontations with their mother at the Music Hall culminated in Jordan permanently severing the relationship, telling her "You're not my mom anymore, and you never were." The second confrontation also exposed Jordan's powers to NSRA agents, connecting them to the vigilante Safeguard. Jordan does not hold a LUMA because their mother refused to sign the required parental consent form. After the homecoming dance incident, Jordan became a fugitive with active warrants for cybercrimes, domestic terrorism, unlicensed use of superpowers, and petty theft.

Despite the chaos, Jordan viewed education as their "one out," earned a full scholarship to MIT, and departed Philadelphia by Greyhound bus - transferring all Auditors leadership to Sam. At MIT, Jordan was assigned to the Non-Euclidean Geometry Research Unit under Dr. Eleanor Chen in the DAAS Specialized Spatial Dynamics Division with AMBER clearance. Their ability to duplicate sealed rooms made them an invaluable research asset, and they were published as fourth author on a preprint paper proposing the "quantum mirage" theory of AOM. Jordan was considering switching from Computer Science to Dynology or pursuing a dual major.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file. Jordan does not hold a LUMA because their mother refused to sign the required parental consent form. Jordan historically denied having powers when confronted by authorities. Their powered status was eventually exposed when NSRA agents connected them to Safeguard (via Mrs. Westwood's description) and publicly confirmed at the homecoming dance when Egalitarian's vertigo field - which only affects non-powered individuals - left Jordan standing while unpowered students collapsed.

### Abilities

- **Spatial Manipulation (Enclosed Spaces)** - Can expand or compress the spatial dimensions within enclosed spaces. Expansion duplicates the space and objects within it (duplicates dissolve into ash over time). Compression "cuts" space, which re-appears when deactivated. Compressed space can disintegrate inanimate objects caught within it.
- **Multi-Region Control** - Can maintain spatial manipulation across up to three distinct regions simultaneously.
- **Living Being Exclusion** - Powers inherently ignore living beings - spatial compression and expansion do not directly harm people, though environmental effects (collapsing structures, shifting concrete) can cause indirect harm.
- **Spatial Compression Combat Applications** - Can sever structural elements (e.g., collapsing a staircase beneath an opponent), block escape routes, and crush shelving to obstruct sightlines.
- **Spatial Expansion Utility** - Can expand small spaces into hidden areas, such as turning a cardboard box into a concealed observation post for multiple people. In emergencies, can expand rooms to create evacuation space (e.g., stretching a burning coffee shop into "a surreal cathedral of smoke" to prevent trampling).
- **AOM Research Applications** - Spatial expansion creates measurable AOM in laboratory conditions. Duplicated objects within expanded sealed chambers can be studied under controlled conditions - uniquely valuable since most AOM (fire, force fields, etc.) cannot be placed under a microscope.
- **Distance Manipulation** - Can warp perceived and actual distance within their field of effect, making movement toward or away from them ineffective.
- **Spatial Redirection** - Can redirect projectile trajectories within enclosed spaces (e.g., redirecting a bullet during the Tioga Street operation).
- **Vertical Spatial Shifting** - Can shift space vertically to create elevated platforms (e.g., raising machinery into a tower during the Dobson Textile Factory escape).

### Limitations

- **Enclosed Spaces Only** - Powers function only within enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces. Open-air environments limit or negate their abilities.
- **Three-Region Limit** - Cannot manipulate more than three spatial regions at once.
- **Living Being Exclusion** - Cannot directly affect living organisms, limiting offensive applications to environmental and structural manipulation.
- **Exhaustion** - Extended use causes visible physical strain (pallor, shaking). Power falters with exhaustion or injury; spatial changes collapse if Jordan loses consciousness.
- **Power Nullification Vulnerability** - Mr. Nothing's skin-contact nullification instantly cancels all active spatial manipulations.
- **No LUMA** - Operates without legal authorization. Active warrants for cybercrimes, domestic terrorism, unlicensed use of superpowers, and petty theft.

### Training & Skills

- Exceptional computer science aptitude - full MIT scholarship, fourth author on a DAAS physics paper as a freshman. Built a custom computer rig at the Music Hall.
- Proficient in electronic surveillance, counter-surveillance, and digital security. Built homemade bug-detection devices, BugTag trackers, directional microphones, and other custom equipment. Set up a Faraday cage room (upgraded from aluminum foil to wire mesh), encrypted communications, and self-hosted website infrastructure with end-to-end encryption.
- Skilled OSINT investigator with expertise in public records analysis, financial forensics, and social engineering. Mapped Kingdom shell company networks using FOIA requests under burner identities, background check services, and online paper trails.
- Competent lockpicker (wave rake and tension wrench) and pickpocket. Taught lockpicking to Sam and Spindle. Built an electronic lockpicking device (which Jordan admitted was "a piece of shit").
- Proficient in data encryption and decryption, including work with pirated biochemistry software on Kingdom USB drives.
- Capable of creating convincing forged press IDs and other documents for undercover operations.

## Personality

Jordan is witty, sarcastic, and deeply intellectual, frequently referencing obscure anime and peppering their speech with pop culture allusions and technical jargon. They approach problems analytically and maintain emotional distance through humor, rarely allowing vulnerability to surface. They would never call themselves a "superhero," insisting their work is practical and self-interested: "This isn't about the greater good. It's because they fucked with me, and demolished my best friend's house. Nothing else." They describe themselves in Magic: The Gathering terms as "black mana" - not good or evil, just survival.

Jordan is deeply political and anti-authoritarian, with a skepticism toward institutions informed by their mother's failures and government complicity with criminal organizations. They view cops and heroes as fundamentally the same, observing that people who believe they are righteous are far more dangerous than villains who know what they are. Despite this worldview, Jordan is capable of cynical pragmatism, counseling Sam to accept adult politics "where everything sucks and there are no good choices."

Despite intellectual confidence, Jordan struggles with impostor syndrome at MIT, admitting they keep waiting for "the other shoe to drop." When asked directly if they were happy, Jordan tentatively said they thought they were - a notable admission for someone who deflects most vulnerability through humor.

Beneath the sardonic exterior, Jordan carries significant emotional weight from years of abuse and neglect. They process fear and guilt through avoidance, as shown by their months-long absence after Sam's hospitalization. Jordan describes Sam as a sibling and credits Sam's influence as transformative. While willing to collaborate with institutions when necessary (the DAAS internship, cooperation with Agent Torres), Jordan also has a ruthless streak - capable of adopting a villain's persona and bluffing convincingly with lethal threats to protect allies.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Best friend / Co-founder | Met as adversaries, became vigilante partners, and co-founded the Auditors. Describe each other as siblings. |
| Connor Spinelli (Spindle) | Romantic partner | Began dating in late 2023. Long-distance after Jordan left for MIT - a rumored breakup turned out to be a misunderstanding. Connor finished his GED and is applying to community colleges. Jordan described his foster family as "really protective - in a good way." |
| Mrs. Westwood | Mother (estranged) | Neglectful and abusive parent. Tracked Jordan to the Music Hall twice, deadnaming them and eventually calling police/NSRA. Relationship permanently severed in early February 2024. Miasma tailed her home afterward and reported that she cried. |
| Alex Garcia | Friend | School friend who provided drone support at the Dobson Textile Factory. Shares Jordan's love of anime. Nervous by nature - explicitly asked to stop having anxiety attacks over hero business at lunch. |
| Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) | Teammate | Fellow Auditor. Paired with Jordan for the City Hall investigation during Arc 8. |
| Tasha Reynolds (Lighthouse) | Teammate | Fellow Auditor who took over as "Research Lead" from Jordan. Shared responsibility for security and intelligence at the Music Hall. |
| Jamila Fayad (Gale) | Associate | Hostile personal dynamic - Jamila called Jordan a "raccoon" and they bickered constantly. Tension persisted through double dates and team interactions, though they could set it aside when stakes were high. |
| Joshua Pleasants (Miasma) | Associate | Contributed to naming the Auditors. Adult supervision for the "Young Defenders Dark" initiative. Jordan initially supported Miasma's NSRA raid plan but recoiled when Miasma's only concern was "getting caught" rather than avoiding harm. |
| Agent Miguel Torres | Contact | NSRA agent who provided intelligence off the record. Impressed by Jordan's investigation setup at the Music Hall. Jordan insisted on running Torres's USB sandboxed. |
| Akilah Washington (Marionette) | Ally | Worked with the Auditors through Chambers & Woo Investigations on Kingdom intelligence. |

| Dr. Famiglietti | DAAS supervisor | Praised Jordan for "exceptional intuition for spatial dynamics." Oversaw the AOM research leading to Jordan's quantum mirage paper co-authorship. |
| Dr. Leonard Harris | DAAS associate | Guest lectures at MIT. Previously tested Sam and Rampart - remembered Sam fondly because she kept breaking his equipment. |
| Patriot | Antagonist | Attempted to arrest Jordan at the homecoming dance. Confronted Jordan and Sam at Patty's Bar. |
| Councilman Jamal Davis | Ally | Proposed the "Young Defenders Dark" initiative. Was "extremely impressed with Jordan's ability to grab the Kingdom." Channeled surplus equipment to the Auditors via "dumpster drops." |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Introduced as the mysterious villain Safeguard - wearing a heavy black cloak, heavily modified white motorcycle helmet with voice changer, and Hot Topic-style boots - who warps the interior of a Walgreens during Sam's first patrol. Neither is a skilled fighter; Sam has better physical conditioning while Safeguard has better technique and power control. Safeguard pins Sam face-down on the carpet and cheese-grates her face using spatial expansion and contraction, then traps her in a shrinking bathroom, triggering claustrophobic panic. Safeguard escapes through the employee stockroom. Sam later spots Jordan at the school lunch table by recognizing their platform boots. Jordan, a sixteen-year-old junior, proposes the staged fights plan using wrestling terminology (Face vs Heel). While scouting the Dobson Textile Factory for their planned performance, they witness Kingdom operatives force Mudslide to murder a captive in an initiation ritual. Alex Garcia's streaming drone captures audio and video evidence before being shot down by Mr. Nothing. During the escape, Jordan deliberately smashes their face on machinery to create a nosebleed Sam can track via blood sense. Both are hospitalized afterward - Jordan with a bruised eye and stitches.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Partners with Sam as a vigilante at the Tacony Music Hall. Jordan provides Sam with clip-on tooth caps to conceal her shark teeth in public. Jordan and Sam semi-regularly confront drug dealers and other criminals, taking money and drugs - with the money funding their operations. Jordan and Sam infiltrate the Crescent nightclub on an undercover mission. Jordan buys Sam a Foo Fighters shirt from Target with their own cash for Sam's first date with Jamila. Provides investigative support, including returning Sam's laptop in a hot pink carrying case. Jordan and Alex have their own friend group at school who read "Murder Cereal" manga.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Living alone at the Music Hall, staying away from their mother to keep her safe from Kingdom retaliation, noting "she probably hasn't even noticed I'm gone. Wouldn't be the first time." Declines Sam's offer to stay with her and Lily. Conducts a month-long solo investigation of the Kingdom using FOIA requests under burner identities, mapping shell company networks including Orion Holdings, Cerulean Dynamics, and Lockhart & Greene. Participates in the Halloween warehouse infiltration alongside Sam, Jamila, and Spindle, creating an expanded spatial fort inside a cardboard box for observation and using a wave rake for padlock entry. After the group witnesses a Kingdom execution, Jordan provides a trash bin for Sam to vomit into, returns with water, and goes on a convenience store run. Presents all evidence to the Delaware Valley Defenders - photocopies, video footage on iPhone. Liberty Belle praises the investigation as "extremely impressive detective work" and tries to recruit Jordan to the hero world, but Jordan cuts her off. Clara Parker explains the concept of parallel construction to build legal cases from the illegally obtained evidence.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Begins dating Connor Spinelli (Spindle), revealed to Sam with a peck on the cheek and the nickname "Conny." Part of the formation of the Auditors alongside Sam, Spindle, and Miasma as adult supervision, as part of Councilman Davis's off-the-books "Young Defenders Dark" initiative. Confronted by their abusive mother at the Music Hall in the first of two incidents - Mrs. Westwood demands money, deadnames Jordan as "Avery," mocks their gender identity, mentions a cousin in jail in Hoboken with supervillain connections, and physically grabs and lifts Jordan. Sam punches Mrs. Westwood in Jordan's defense, and Jordan's powers activate defensively, stretching the room to create miles of space between them and their mother. During the second confrontation in early February 2024, Mrs. Westwood calls 911 and NSRA agents respond. Jordan denies having powers to Officer Anderson. Mrs. Westwood attempts to provoke Jordan's powers by grabbing their wrists and describes the abilities to NSRA agents, who connect the description to the vigilante Safeguard. Jordan reveals their power origin - the car trunk incident - during a final private confrontation with their mother and permanently severs the relationship. Establishes digital infrastructure at the Music Hall including rigging Wi-Fi, setting up cracked laptops from Councilman Davis, and building a mini electronics lab. Discovers surveillance bugs in the Music Hall and implements counter-surveillance measures including soundproofing, heavy curtains, and regular sweeping with homemade detection equipment. Teaches Sam lockpicking with paperclips. Leads the team to investigate the NSRA office in Hatboro-Horsham, posing as student journalists with a mock press ID. Jordan and Sam deliberately tell lies to Mr. Polygraph (operating undercover as "Agent Parker") to provoke revealing reactions, with Jordan proving to have a far superior poker face. Pays for the taxi with a hundred-dollar bill, secretly leaving another hundred under the front seat. Accompanies the Auditors into the abandoned subway tunnels under South Philadelphia to set up surveillance on a suspected Kingdom-Chernobyl location, using an electronic lockpicking device on the service door.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Co-renovates the Tacony Music Hall with Sam into a functional headquarters - the owner hooks them up with real electricity, Jordan installs new locks on every door (a locksmith owed them a favor for "vigilante discounts"), upgrades the Faraday cage room from aluminum foil to actual wire mesh, and sets up a medical area with legally obtained supplies. Jordan's vision for the space is "a haven. For healing. For planning. For us." During a first patrol back with Sam, they encounter the Tacony Titans (Sundial and Bubble), who mistake Jordan for Sam's sidekick - Jordan corrects them: "Less sidekick, more the one ensuring Wolf doesn't bite off more than she can chew." Broke into Derek Taylor's home without authorization, discovering cages in the basement used for werewolf containment, and gave Sam a USB with the findings. Jordan was also officially disowned by their mother during this period - Mrs. Westwood dumped all of Jordan's possessions at the Music Hall. Identifies Squeal (Steven Praznik) as a mid-level drug dealer through FOIA requests, background check services, and online paper trails. Creates a concealed observation post by expanding a cardboard box with spatial powers during the Tioga Street sting (expanding one axis at a time). When the operation goes sideways, uses spatial warping to redirect a bullet's trajectory. Tracks Squeal via GPS until the signal dies near the Delaware River. Pickpockets and clones an RFID key fob from a building resident to enable the Sparkplug infiltration. During the warehouse raid, bluffs Sparkplug with a gun, speaking through their voice changer in a cold monotone, claiming they would shoot through Sam to take Sparkplug down - a ruthless act that successfully saves Miss Mayfly's life. Evacuates civilians from neighboring units alongside Sandman during the final action. Jordan and Marcus bond over tech talk about LunarOS, Asteroid, and Quasar protocols. Modifies Kate Smith's wrist-mounted pepper spray canister into an injector glove alongside Spindle, per Sam's plan.

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Has not visited Sam since she woke from her post-Chernobyl coma. Arrives at the hospital in April with huge bags under their eyes, slightly dolled up with gelled hair, wearing a sweater in warm weather. Admits they were "scared of seeing you hurt, scared of what it meant that I couldn't protect you," and that distancing was the only way they knew to handle the guilt. Sam confronts them: "It's April, Jordan." Jordan reveals they tracked down the Music Hall's owner and secured a rental agreement using their college fund, providing approximately four months of rent, though the building is not zoned for residency. Describes Sam as a sibling ("You can just say sibling") and the two reconcile with an extended hug lasting minutes. Jordan partially hopes Sam's return to action will fund continued rent through reclaimed criminal wealth. Jordan confirms they are "not into girls" (sexuality clarified) and is dating Spindle. Sam confides details of her support group, describing Derek Taylor as someone who "dresses like the Columbine dudes." Jordan reads Sam's obsession with Derek clearly - "the mystique has you going absolutely insane" - and offers to tail Derek but ultimately decides against it, knowing Sam's conscience could not justify spying on a hunch.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Delivers a tin of weed to Sam's bedroom window after the breakup with Jamila. Visits Sam during her multi-week recovery from the courthouse attack alongside Connor, bringing an omnibus of One Piece manga and gummy worms. Connor refers to Jordan as "Professor Westwood" during the visit. Jordan tries to talk about the courthouse incident but Sam shuts it down; Jordan responds, "When you're ready, I'm here." Walks with Sam on the first day of sophomore year, commenting bitterly on the police presence and metal detectors at school: "It's like we're living in a police state."

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Major Supporting

    Now a senior at Tacony Charter Academy taking AP Calculus, wearing sweaters and sweatpants in "brazen defiance of the dress code." Jordan is present when Officer Ridley assaults a student, and quickly sends Sam video evidence when called upon by text. Identifies Patty's Bar as a cop bar in South Philly connected to the school security guards, using traffic cam footage to prove the connection. Infiltrates Patty's Bar with Sam on September 13, where Jordan dubs Patriot's outfit "Captain America cosplay" and observes he talks "like a fucking thesaurus." Records audio throughout the visit on their phone. When Patriot and Egalitarian confront them in the parking lot, Jordan plays meek to defuse the situation. Afterward, tells Sam these people are more dangerous than villains because they believe they are the good guys. Calls Sam "my best friend" during the debrief. Co-creates the anonymous whistleblower website with Sam, Derek, and Spindle - Jordan handles all technical infrastructure, self-hosting the site on their own servers with end-to-end encryption. Prints QR codes for distribution through school bathrooms. Defends the site against DDoS attacks through an all-night session, getting the server back up by 4:37 AM with improved security. Subtly uses space-warping powers to help Mike Giannopoulos during a fight with security guard Kowalski, stretching and compressing space so that Kowalski's punches go wide while Mike's connect. Investigates a real estate developer named Gerald Ford connected to Pattinson's Pals funding. Teaches Sam reverse-pickpocketing and builds a directional microphone for surveillance. Programs a timed cron job to auto-post all compiled evidence during the homecoming dance, using the dance as an alibi. At the dance, Jordan wears a purple and black suit combo. When Patriot arrives to arrest Jordan for cybercrimes and domestic terrorism, Jordan declares, "I'm Jordan Westwood. And I'm not going anywhere with you fascist fucks." Students and teachers rally in a "Spartacus moment," cascading claims of "I'm Jordan Westwood!" - including Mr. Weston and even some security guards. Egalitarian's vertigo field, which only affects non-powered individuals, inadvertently reveals Jordan as powered when they remain standing while unpowered students collapse. A gunshot from Parabellum strikes the gymnasium door near Jordan, leaving them with a shallow face cut from splinters. Jordan escapes through the chaos. Becomes a fugitive with an active warrant for cybercrimes, domestic terrorism, unlicensed use of superpowers, and petty theft. The whistleblower website is taken down via legal injunction, though Jordan retains backups. Afterward, seen "bandaged, standing to side, looking small and lost." Referenced by Sam during congressional testimony as a symbol of unjust persecution.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sends Sam frantic texts about Maya Richardson's candidacy. Accompanies Sam to meet Republican candidate Richard Duvall at his Center City campaign headquarters to warn him about Richardson. Jordan and Sam bring a flash drive with T-Rex attack video as evidence. Jordan notes Richardson "can control the weather," citing rain that appeared when the forecast was clear. Duvall dismisses their evidence, misgenders Jordan (first "young man," then "young lady"), and pivots to a racist monologue about "cancer" neighborhoods - Jordan pushes back, noting "It sounds like you're saying some neighborhoods are inherently more criminal." Jordan lives a couple blocks from Tioga, one of the neighborhoods Duvall disparages. In the alley afterward, Jordan counsels political realism: "Maybe Richardson winning wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. At least with Richardson, we know what we're dealing with." Tells Sam, "Welcome to the wonderful world of adult politics... where everything sucks and there are no good choices."

    Stays up all night researching Richardson's finances, finding nothing definitive. Joins Sam and Tasha for dumpster diving at Richardson's campaign office, finding a receipt for a large cash deposit. Provides earpiece support while Sam infiltrates the campaign office undercover as "Sarah from Temple University." Accompanies Sam as fake student journalists to interview candidate Frank Martinez at a Fairmount Park rally, where Martinez warns them about Richardson's shell companies and offshore accounts. Participates in a debrief at the Music Hall with Sam and Tasha when leads run dry the night before the election.

    Present at the Music Hall on election night alongside Sam, Connor, and Tasha, watching results on an ancient TV. After Richardson wins, Jordan and Sam smoke weed on the roof - a deal they made that if they found nothing, Jordan would get Sam high. Jordan uses a glass bowl with indica. Sam's first time smoking. When Sam asks if Liberty Belle would be disappointed, Jordan says, "I think she'd understand, Sam... it's okay to take a break sometimes. To be human." They stay on the roof until dawn.

    Briefs the team for the second Crescent nightclub infiltration at the Music Hall alongside Sam, Connor, Maggie, and Derek. Jordan handles comms and earpiece support, provides a fake ID that passes bouncer inspection, and plants wireless bugs disguised as hearing aids. During Sam's infiltration, the signal gets jammed by the club's electronic shielding, cutting Jordan off from comms. Jordan cross-references the map photo Sam recovered from the club office on a laptop, connecting marked locations to news articles and public records, and identifies that the planted bug is likely useless due to limited memory and electronic shielding. Proposes splitting investigation leads: Jordan and Maggie take City Hall, Connor and Derek take the docks. Pushes to tell the Delaware Valley Defenders about the Kingdom's plans, saying, "This is big, Sam. Too big for us to handle on our own," and adds, "I trust you implicitly."

    Investigates Rogue Wave contracts and the Mr. ESP threat. Jordan explains Mr. ESP gets "a new ESP power every day" and that the Faraday cage room was built specifically because of him. Describes the Rogue Wave trigger phrase as "straight out of a Cold War spy novel" and theorizes it involves either a new metahuman with mind control or "cutting-edge brainwashing tech." When Derek suggests hacking police radio, Jordan explodes: "That's not how hacking works!" and explains real hacking involves social engineering, phishing, and tailgating into buildings - "the human stuff." Refuses to break into government databases, calling it "a one-way ticket to federal fuck-me-in-the-ass prison." Jordan built their custom computer rig at the Music Hall.

    Present during the CPS home visit for Connor Spinelli's adoption case. Jordan texts Sam in a panic - "CPS AGENT COMING TO INTERVIEW US ASAP FOR CONNOR'S ADOPTION!!!" - and orchestrates frantic de-superheroing of the Music Hall: the map room is stripped bare, walls painted "Eggshell" beige, digital stations shoved in a closet, and security systems toned down. The Faraday cage room remains unexplainable, which Jordan covers as "cybersecurity testing purposes." During Jordan's private interview with the CPS agent (Ms. Katz), raised voices are audible through the floorboards. Jordan claims to be emancipated - Katz doesn't buy it. Jordan reveals, "Last year my mom burned down our house with me inside it," then corrects: "No. But it's close enough." Jordan also states, "Like fuck am I going to foster care. I'd rather chug an entire bottle of Draino. I am not becoming a 'foster child' again" - confirming they were formerly in the foster care system. Afterward, Jordan lights a blunt from their pocket, hands shaking from stress, and says, "I thought we were goners."

    Works with Amelia at her workshop on fitting Sam's new winterized beta costume, tweaking the design on a tablet. Jordan "knows a guy" for the waterproof fur trim. When the team debates Sam's plan to investigate the zoo lead solo, Jordan insists on a comm link as non-negotiable and notes Philly PD is unreliable, possibly on Kingdom payroll.

    Present at the Golden Panda Buffet for Thanksgiving dinner alongside Sam, Lily, Jason, Amelia, and Connor. Jordan is uncomfortable with the crowd but determined to be there. Connor makes a toast: "To friends... and to hopefully not dying horribly in the near future!"

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Major Supporting

    Announces a full-ride MIT scholarship, practically bouncing with excitement. Notes that MIT has a lab for researching superhuman tech and that they could "do something useful for us from the other side of things." Reassures Sam: "This doesn't mean I'm abandoning you... We're still the Auditors." Sometimes patrols with Sam in the mornings while Connor takes evening shifts.

    Walking with Sam and Alex Garcia after school when a garbage can fire erupts nearby, prompting Sam's panic attack. Jordan identifies the flames as road flares. When Sam bolts, Alex tries to follow for ten feet before remembering he's not in shape. Jordan arrives at Sam's location in platform boots - "ridiculous" but graceful. Their cologne is "stupidly expensive" (shoplifted from Macy's). Sits close but not touching. On the walk back to the Music Hall, Sam takes a double dose of lithium. Jordan asks, "Can you overdose on lithium?" and when told yes, expresses concern. Hosts an anime movie night at the Music Hall - presents a folder labeled "Psychological Stuff (Not Evangelion)." Sam refuses Evangelion ("the more you tell me about it the less I want to watch it"), so they watch Nausicaa instead. Jordan notes Nausicaa has "Sam vibes" - "trying to fix everything, even though the whole world is messed up." They order pizza at 1 AM, then watch a cyberpunk anime from the 80s and "Ghost Blade." At around 2 AM, Sam waits for Jordan to fall asleep and sneaks out to patrol. Jordan is awake when Sam returns and confronts them: "You didn't think to mention you were leaving?" Challenges Sam with, "Do you even know what you want? After this year's over, are you just going to keep doing this?" and asks the existential question: "Sam, what ARE you?" - to which Sam has no answer.

    Conducts systematic fire testing with Sam and Tasha at the Music Hall. Clicks a lighter - a tiny blue flame - to test Sam's pyrophobia response. Wraps a flashlight in red cellophane to test whether color alone triggers Sam's fear (it doesn't - "not remotely the same thing"). Takes over noting observations while Tasha assumes the "Research Lead" role. Comments on Sam's territorial fire response: "You're kind of a shark on land already. Why not add a little territorial flair?" Discovers the Kingdom's alphabetical naming convention - no overlapping first letters among operatives - and notices it has no repeats. Cross-references the fire locations with Sam's patrol routes and discovers they line up, forming a circle around Tacony Charter Academy with the school at the center. Tells Sam, "I think you might be getting stalked." When Sam insists Aaron isn't responsible, Jordan counters: "What if Aaron's power was always capable of this, but he didn't know it?" Also finds arson reports from the past year stretching into Bucks County - earlier reports yellow (Aaron's known fire), later reports shifting to red and blue, with a trail moving toward Philadelphia.

    Responds to a fire at a coffee shop with Sam, wearing a spray-painted motorcycle helmet with a bug-eyed Power Ranger look. Uses space expansion powers to evacuate civilians - stretching the ceiling upward and pulling walls back, creating "a surreal cathedral of smoke" that gives panicked people room to move and prevents trampling. Shouts, "Go! There's space! Take it slow, one at a time!" Takes an unconscious woman from Sam and guides her toward the exit while maintaining the space expansion. Exits with the last group of civilians, at which point the walls snap back to normal dimensions and flames leap up behind the counter. Visible strain from the effort - sweat and physical exhaustion.

    Investigates the coffee shop fire scene afterward with a portable police-scanner-hijacker device that looks like a 90s camcorder. At the Music Hall, calls Tasha and Maggie over for "moral support" when news broadcasts a sketch of Safeguard from the coffee shop rescue. Suggests "Girls and They's Night" with giant robot anime. Hands Sam a granola bar on a silent walk to school the next morning after Sam hasn't slept.

    When Aaron breaks into the Music Hall through the back entrance, Jordan swings a baseball bat and catches him in the stomach. Aaron recovers and yellow fire erupts from the floor, splashing against the metal doorframe and scorching the hallway. Tasha sprays a fire extinguisher while Sam pursues Aaron outside. Afterward, Jordan and Tasha put up fire blankets on the bannisters. Jordan reacts to Sam's account of fighting Aaron: "You went shark-jaws-first into a fight with Aaron AND dragged Derek into it." Takes watch shifts with Tasha at the Music Hall, running anime on a laptop at low volume. Accompanies the group to Kalahari water park in the Poconos after Aaron's arrest.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Major Supporting

    Purchases a SignalTrack Pro XT-5000 police scanner for the Auditors to monitor police frequencies. Has an emotional conversation with Sam about the looming MIT departure - says Sam made them a better person, showing genuine vulnerability from the usually analytical Jordan. Jordan is done with all school assignments early in preparation for MIT and is transferring the Music Hall lease to Sam. Jordan is technically homeless, with Sam's parents serving as quasi-adoptive parents.

    Investigates Rogue Wave activity with Sam after the scanner picks up an arson report. They find pepper-sprayed drug dealers and evidence of coordinated vigilante activity - a drug house cleared out by an unknown individual. Researches the law firm Tremont & Fairfax with Sam, discovering the firm's unusual split between pro bono work and corporate law, a pattern of defending supervillains, and a junior partner linked to a shell company warehouse in Kensington that burned down. Present at Sam's birthday celebration alongside Maggie, Lily, Tasha, and others, with a cookie instead of cake for Passover (no leavened bread).

    Formally declares Sam the boss and leader of the Auditors. Stands on a cafeteria lunch table at school, claims to be a Kingdom of Keys supervillain, and demonstrates space-warping powers publicly - a deliberate provocation intended to force Rogue Wave contractors into revealing themselves. Officer Ridley, previously established as a racist security guard, is exposed as a Rogue Wave-contracted sleeper agent when he attacks Jordan with a taser and tries to crush their throat with a baton. Sam puts Ridley in a chokehold for eleven seconds until he goes unconscious. Ridley is fired after the exposure. Both Jordan and Sam receive one-week suspensions and detention three times a week for the rest of the year. Jordan is technically staying with the Smalls as quasi-adoptive parents during this period. Jordan suggests using a laptop camera for surveillance of Kate's nighttime activities; the first attempt fails due to power saver mode, but the second captures Kate returning at 3:04 AM.

    Leads the Auditors' infiltration of the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse on Trenton Avenue. Uses space-warping to bypass security cameras. The team discovers a chemical processing lab with glassware and fume hoods, chemical storage containing acetic anhydride, sodium hydroxide, and toluene, and shipping manifests. Jordan retrieves USB drives from the warehouse servers. When Argus Corps arrives in a beat-up sedan with no cops or sirens - an off-the-books operation - Jordan immediately realizes the implications and shifts the plan to "stall, escape, survive." Uses spatial compression to crush shelving and block Captain Devil's sightlines. During Sam's fight with Patriot on a staircase, Jordan compresses space to sever the staircase beneath Sam, dropping Patriot twelve feet through the gap. A security guard is rescued by jumping from a window onto a fireproof cloak stretched out by Jordan and Blink. During the escape, Jordan drives Blink's moped while Blink skates alongside. Jordan, Blink, Maggie, and Sam pile into a bumblebee-yellow taxicab arranged by Gossamer. Jordan tips the bewildered Indian taxi driver forty dollars upfront and directs them to South Street to wait twenty minutes before driving back. Jordan escaped the marina earlier by hiding inside a cardboard box, using space-duplication powers to fill the top layer with fake drugs, and brought back Post-it notes with intelligence gathered. When Monkey Business announces 30,000 Rogue Wave contractors in Philadelphia on a hijacked NBC10 broadcast, Jordan says "Lie" - the actual number is much lower.

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at a post-warehouse McDonald's debrief where they reveal the stolen USB drives contain chemistry and biomedical data encrypted with military-grade RSA keys that they cannot understand - expert help is needed. Texts Sam with this assessment. Approximately three weeks after the warehouse operation, with school winding down and finals approaching, Jordan reveals the DAAS internship at MIT (Department of Applied Anomalous Sciences). Discusses encryption limitations with Devonte at Chambers & Woo Investigations and transfers approximately 200 GB of Kingdom-related data to the PI server. Jordan is leaving in three weeks, and lease transfer paperwork is needed for the Music Hall.

    When the team meets in the Faraday room and Sam tells them about the Kingdom encounter and Soot, Jordan asks, "And you think it's Kate" - not as a question. Sam texts Jordan and the other Auditors from the car ride to New York for the Mr. Antithesis meeting. Lily later texts: "Jordan is fine and Max is roped in. Thank you for keeping us updated."

    At the farewell party at the Music Hall, Jordan is packing up and handing off responsibilities to Sam. Fight Club plays on the projector - Jordan's pick for "last movie night." Derek Taylor is present after being AWOL for weeks, looking for Elias (no luck - possibly dead or left Philadelphia). Connor Spinelli is present and brings Jordan a shoebox of their stuff - confirming they are still together, as what was rumored to be a breakup was actually a misunderstanding. Jordan gives Sam full admin privileges for Music Hall systems. The encrypted Stheno data is backed up on a thumb drive and secure server. Jordan is enrolled in a summer program at MIT before the fall semester and is setting up an apartment rather than doing dorms.

    Departs Philadelphia for MIT by Greyhound bus. Jordan cried, Sam cried, and Connor "wailed like a baby." Jordan's viral video documenting the Rogue Wave contract enforcement clause causes significant disruption to Rogue Wave operations - Monkey Business is forced to revise the contract language from an immediate violent attack to a multi-stage non-violent response, and contract retention drops to 92% post-exposure. The JW.1 interlude reveals Jordan's formal MIT-DAAS acceptance letter: assigned to the Non-Euclidean Geometry Research Unit under Dr. Eleanor Chen in the Specialized Spatial Dynamics Division with AMBER clearance. Jordan's abilities are described in the document as "localized space compression without mass displacement" - a significant anomaly bridging quantum field theory and general relativity, classified as RESTRICTED under the Superhuman Research Protection Act of 2013.

    **Role:** Supporting

    At MIT in the DAAS program, studying AOM decay patterns under Prof. Simmons. Provides remote intelligence to the Auditors. Reports significant developments near the MIT campus during the Bloom crisis - a concussive energy discharge from someone who Activated while being kettled by police results in 87 injured, 12 critical, and 4 confirmed Activations. Jordan monitors the situation from MIT and relays observations about MIT security conducting sweeps of technology labs. Communicates with Sam via HIRC (Hero IRC) when regular cell networks become jammed and overloaded. Posts a fake challenge message from "Bloodhound" across all platforms: "To the coward killing birds: I see you. Stop hurting animals and face me directly. Bloodhound." Operates botnets to amplify the message's reach.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Supporting

    At MIT, available at midnight on a Tuesday - "of course I'm up." Sam contacts Jordan and uploads approximately 300 evidence photos taken during night operations hitting Kingdom targets. Jordan sorts through them, identifying 47 actually useful images out of the batch (most were cover sheets and blank forms), and creates an organized highlights folder with categories: financial records, loan documents, city connections, and Kingdom operational. Each category includes descriptive notes. Sam sends the package to CapeWatch Philly via burner email, including impersonation evidence, Jordan's highlights folder, a timeline, and a Philadelphia map with geographic connections. CapeWatch forwards the financial evidence to the Inquirer and investigators, and runs an impersonation article at 7:15 AM. The Inquirer financial crimes desk confirms the documents are credible.

    **Role:** Supporting (Remote)

    Participates in the gambit against the Kingdom from the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge, using spatial manipulation to keep Akilah and Devonte hidden while Akilah fakes Brainwash's commands with her invisible strings.

    Provides remote support from MIT via text after the Music Hall is attacked by Kingdom contractor Garbage Day - the door is destroyed, partitions shredded, laptops and computers destroyed, and water pipes damaged. Jordan confirms that research data is backed up via hourly sync, with the last backup at 3:47 PM; everything after that time is lost, but it is all public records and reconstructable. Jordan theorizes the Kingdom flagged inquiries about Victor's trucking company and/or noticed Nina's meeting with the Smalls, and sent a contractor to destroy whatever investigation they thought was happening - but they don't know what was actually found, meaning the Silverstein connection remains secret. Jordan offers stipend money for replacement equipment. Jordan's shell company research from the spring is referenced as having been professionally scrubbed by the Kingdom - dissolved, financial records locked, web presence erased. The BugTag tracking device that Tasha plants on Garbage Day during the attack is one of Jordan's homemade devices, small enough to clip into a jacket pocket, which shows the target's location on a map app with trail and timestamps. Jordan's furniture at the Music Hall is rearranged for Councilman Davis's new mentorship program for Activated youth. The Silverstein investigation builds on leads that are not on Jordan's old Kingdom front company list.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting (Remote)

    Lily mentions Jordan has taken on more leadership responsibilities remotely since leaving and wants to video call tonight to show the team their progress. Participates in a video call from the MIT library, wearing an unfamiliar hoodie, looking tired but happy. It is finals week and Jordan has been in the library for 72 hours straight, with one more exam tomorrow (computer architecture). Reports that Connor finished his GED last month with high marks on math and is applying to community colleges - trade programs, possibly electrician or plumbing, maybe BCCC. Jordan is working on a robotics lab project and doing something at DAAS that is literally classified - they cannot discuss it without losing the scholarship or facing jail time. Jordan's voice goes soft when talking about Connor.

    Silverstein shell company evidence sits encrypted on Jordan's server, though Councilman Davis knows about it but cannot convince the DA without a preponderance of evidence. The evidence from the Music Hall attack can be reconstructed since it was all from public records.

    During Sam's night operations, Sam uses a jiggler lockpick that Jordan taught her. Sam contacts Jordan again and uploads approximately 200 evidence photos from a break-in at a Kingdom operation. Jordan sorts them: 43 are usable, the rest garbage. Jordan drafts an Inquirer package with a timeline, context, and pattern identification, estimating a 30-minute turnaround. Connor's arm is visible at the edge of the video frame during this call, which takes place 40 minutes before Jordan's study group. Sam later uses a prop gun - the "Graviton Beam Emitter" - which is a callback to Jordan's fake gun from the manga "BLAME!" Tasha corrects the count during a video call: "Six" Auditors, not five - Jordan is still an Auditor despite being at MIT. Jordan and Sam previously broke up dog fighting rings together, referenced when Sam reflects on moral complexity.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** Interlude (JW.2)

    Text conversation between Jordan and Sam. Jordan excitedly announces their co-authorship (fourth author) on a preprint paper proposing the "quantum mirage" theory of AOM - that superhuman powers create material by overlaying quantum-entangled copies of nearby matter frame by frame, and AOM dissolves not through decay but by the overlay ceasing to be maintained. Jordan explains the science to Sam using movie frame and photograph analogies, describing how AOM "telefrags" (overwrites) existing matter in place rather than displacing or transmuting it, and how this resolves the longstanding air chamber paradox in AOM research. Jordan's conversational style is rapid-fire, tangential, and enthusiastic compared to Sam's deadpan and grounding replies. Jordan references a teenage girl with laser eyes who worked with DAAS as a prior research subject - her lasers were preferential, borrowing photons from nearby real lasers via quantum entanglement. Jordan mentions the "vermiform appendage" that likely mediates AOM creation in all superhumans, and uses Aaron McKinley's fire powers as an example of unsolved questions - how he creates a flash-igniting substance without a "Fire Pouch." Jordan reveals they are considering switching their major from Computer Science to Dynology (the academic discipline of studying metahuman powers) or dual-majoring, admits to impostor syndrome at MIT - "I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop" - while tentatively acknowledging happiness: "The work is interesting. The people mostly aren't assholes." Describes their own lab space as "basically a closet but it's MY closet." Jordan mentions Dr. Famiglietti's praise ("exceptional intuition for spatial dynamics") and Dr. Leonard Harris guest-lecturing at MIT - Harris remembers Sam and Rampart as favorite test subjects because Sam kept breaking his equipment, and wants a full report on Sam's new undiscovered powers. Jordan notes Sam is "getting better at opsec" after Sam deflects questions about a city councilwoman's alibi manufacturing operation being exposed. The two plan to hang out during summer break, possibly with Connor. Jordan mentions Connor's foster family being "really protective, in a good way." Sam mentions her ankle monitor recently came off. The catchphrase "Don't make it weird" is used by both during the conversation, a symmetry neither acknowledges. The conversation ends with mutual affection and purple heart emojis.
