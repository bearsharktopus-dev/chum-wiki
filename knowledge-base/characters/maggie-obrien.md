??? warning "Background"

    Magdalene "Maggie" O'Brien is a teenage metahuman who gained her powers after being caught in the Phreaks' courthouse attack during Arc 6 (the "Sideshow" arc). During that crisis, Sam Small saved Maggie's life from a collapsing building, an act Maggie would later cite as the foundational reason she pursued superheroism. Maggie's powers manifested as semispherical repulsion force fields emanating from her palms and the soles of her feet.

    Maggie first appeared as an unknown costumed figure during a South Philly patrol in September 2024, where Sam and Rampart encountered her operating under the name Flashpoint. Sam recognized Maggie as the person she had rescued during the Phreaks' attack and agreed to take her on as a mentee, arranging to train her and eventually patrol together. From that point forward, Sam served as Maggie's primary mentor, teaching her self-defense techniques, power integration in combat, and the practical realities of vigilante life.

    Maggie comes from a lower-middle-class Irish Catholic family in South Philadelphia. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien, are strict and have grounded her multiple times for participating in superhero activities. The O'Briens have at times blamed Sam for being a negative influence on their daughter, leading to heated confrontations between the two families after incidents such as Maggie's arrest during a patrol in Kensington. Despite parental opposition, Maggie has remained committed to her role as a hero and became a core member of the Auditors, Sam's independent team operating out of the Tacony Music Hall (later the Tacony Community Center).

??? note "Powers & Abilities"

    **PERKS Assessment**

    No official PERKS assessment on file.

    **Abilities**

    - **Semispherical Force Field Generation** - Creates semispherical repulsion force fields that emanate from her palms and the soles of her feet, totaling up to four fields at once. These fields project concussive force outward in a hemispherical pattern from the point of origin.
    - **Hoverskating** - Uses the force fields from her feet to lift herself off the ground and propel herself through the air, allowing a form of low-altitude flight or rapid skating movement across surfaces.
    - **Projectile Acceleration** - Channels force fields to launch objects at high velocity. Can project baseballs at speeds of 100-110 mph and fire loose materials such as gravel like shrapnel.
    - **Spiking** - Can concentrate all the energy from all four fields into a single field for a momentary burst of amplified force, significantly increasing the output of one field at the expense of the others.
    - **Defensive Shielding** - Employs force fields as protective barriers to block incoming attacks, deflect projectiles, and shield allies from environmental hazards such as chemical traps.
    - **Structural Manipulation** - Uses focused force field energy to break mechanisms such as locks, enabling entry into secured locations.

    **Limitations**

    - Maggie is a baseline human outside of her force field abilities; she lacks enhanced durability, regeneration, or any secondary physical enhancements.
    - She has been seriously injured in the field, including being shot multiple times during the zoo battle in Arc 8, surviving only because she was wearing Sam's bulletproof vest.
    - The "spiking" technique sacrifices the output of all other fields to concentrate into one, leaving her temporarily exposed.
    - Specific upper limits of force field durability and sustained output are not documented.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Trained in basic self-defense and combat techniques by Sam Small, including judo and boxing fundamentals.
    - Learned to integrate her force fields into hand-to-hand combat through regular training sessions with Sam.
    - Received practical field training through patrols and missions with the Auditors, gaining real-world experience in surveillance, reconnaissance, and team coordination.
    - Knowledgeable about the Superhero Juvenile Safety Act (SJSA) and the legal protections afforded to minor metahumans, which she explained to Sam after their arrest.
    - Serves as a peer mentor to younger powered individuals through the community center mentorship program alongside Sam.

??? warning "Personality"

    Maggie is energetic, optimistic, and enthusiastic, often speaking quickly and expressively with frequent exclamations. She brings a persistent positivity to the team that contrasts with the more hardened or cynical attitudes of her teammates. She is deeply loyal to Sam and views her as a mentor figure, despite the narrow age gap between them. Her admiration for Sam is grounded not in hero worship but in genuine gratitude for being saved and a sincere belief in Sam's mission.

    Beneath her eager exterior, Maggie possesses a streak of moral seriousness that emerges in critical moments. She has confronted Sam directly about reckless behavior and hypocrisy, invoking Liberty Belle's legacy and her own experience of being shot to argue that sacrifice must carry meaning rather than serve as self-destruction. She drew an ultimatum demanding Sam operate as a team captain and strategist rather than a lone field operative, citing the example of Father Mike's teaching that sacrifice must mean something. While somewhat naive and prone to absorbing bad habits from Sam, Maggie demonstrates growing maturity and the willingness to challenge authority figures she respects when she believes they are wrong.
