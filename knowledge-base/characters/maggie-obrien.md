## Background

Magdalene "Maggie" O'Brien gained her powers after being caught in the Phreaks' courthouse attack during Arc 6. Sam Small saved her life during that crisis, an act Maggie cites as her foundational reason for pursuing superheroism. Her powers manifested as semispherical repulsion force fields emanating from her palms and the soles of her feet.

Maggie first appeared during a South Philly patrol in September 2024, operating independently under the name Flashpoint. Sam recognized her as the person she rescued during the Phreaks' attack and agreed to mentor her. The DVDs expressed interest in recruiting Maggie for the Young Defenders, but Sam deflected. Maggie became a core member of the Auditors and later co-leads the community center mentorship program.

She comes from a lower-middle-class Irish Catholic family in South Philadelphia. Her parents, Sean and Eileen O'Brien, are strict and have grounded her multiple times for superhero activities. The O'Briens have blamed Sam for being a negative influence, leading to a confrontation between the families at the police station after Maggie's arrest in Kensington (Arc 10). Despite parental opposition, Maggie has remained committed to her role.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Semispherical Force Field Generation** - Creates semispherical repulsion force fields that emanate from her palms and the soles of her feet, totaling up to four fields at once. These fields project concussive force outward in a hemispherical pattern from the point of origin. Can also create an invisible barrier that bounces punches, described as feeling like a "wall of jello."
- **Hoverskating** - Uses the force fields from her feet to lift herself roughly three inches off the ground and propel herself in a skating motion across surfaces. By projecting fields downward and slightly backward, she achieves rapid ground-speed boosts. She can also perform aerial maneuvers such as midair backflips and wall rebounds for frictionless movement.
- **Projectile Acceleration** - Channels force fields to launch objects at high velocity. Can project baseballs at approximately 70 mph one-handed and 90-100 mph two-handed, and fire loose materials such as gravel and pebbles like shrapnel ("pebble buckshot"). During the zoo battle, she disarmed Mr. Nothing by launching a flat stone at his gun and peppered Mudslide with pebble buckshot that left fifteen bloody pockmarks across his face and chest.
- **Spiking** - Can concentrate all the energy from all four fields into a single field for a momentary burst of amplified force, significantly increasing the output of one field at the expense of the others.
- **Defensive Shielding** - Employs force fields as protective barriers to block incoming attacks, deflect projectiles, and shield allies from environmental hazards such as chemical traps. During the Metropolitan Opera House mission in Arc 14, she used her force fields to protect Amelia's face from chemical spray.
- **Structural Manipulation** - Uses focused force field energy to break mechanisms such as locks, enabling entry into secured locations.
- **Enhanced Throws** - Can integrate her repulsion fields into hand-to-hand grappling to enhance judo throws, dramatically amplifying the force of the technique. During training, she sent Sam flying halfway across an alley with a single field-enhanced throw.
- **Mobility in Adverse Terrain** - Her hoverskating allows her to move freely above surfaces that would impede ground movement. During the zoo battle, she skated above Mudslide's quicksand floor on her foot-based repulsion fields while Sam was trapped.

### Limitations

- Baseline human outside of her force field abilities - no enhanced durability, regeneration, or secondary physical enhancements. Has been seriously injured in the field (Arc 8).
- The "spiking" technique sacrifices all other fields to concentrate into one, leaving her temporarily exposed.
- Specific upper limits of force field durability and sustained output are not documented.
- Has expressed anxiety about the lethal potential of her powers: "I just keep thinking... about how easy it would be to just... squeeze someone's head. With my fields. Like a grape."

### Training & Skills

- Trained by Sam in judo (stances, falling, throws, holds) and boxing fundamentals, integrating force fields into hand-to-hand combat.
- Practical field experience through Auditors patrols and missions - surveillance, reconnaissance, and team coordination.
- Knowledgeable about the Superhero Juvenile Safety Act (SJSA) and legal protections for minor metahumans. Carries a LUMA card.
- Co-leads the community center mentorship program alongside Sam, running sessions with powered teenagers.

## Personality

Maggie is energetic, optimistic, and enthusiastic, often speaking quickly and expressively. She brings a persistent positivity that contrasts with the more hardened attitudes of her teammates. Deeply loyal to Sam, her admiration is grounded not in hero worship but in genuine gratitude and a sincere belief in Sam's mission. She calls Sam "sensei" and has referred to her as "Bloodpuppy," a nickname Sam finds uncomfortable because it mirrors what criminals call her.

Beneath her eager exterior, Maggie possesses moral seriousness that emerges in critical moments. During Sam's attempted retirement (Arc 14), she confronted Sam directly about secretly researching Kingdom operations: "You're not retired, Sam. You're pretending to be retired." While somewhat naive and prone to absorbing bad habits from Sam, she demonstrates growing maturity and willingness to challenge authority figures she respects.

Maggie has also shown a capacity for lethal intensity under extreme stress - the zoo battle (Arc 8) revealed both the raw power of her abilities and the danger of losing control when she nearly crushed Mudslide's skull before Sam snapped her out of it.

Arrives careening through the air, hovering roughly three inches off the ground, wearing a mishmash of athletic gear and a Halloween costume with an oversized motorcycle helmet. Revealed to have been saved by Sam during the Phreaks' courthouse attack in Arc 6; that rescue is her stated reason for pursuing superheroism. Sam agrees to mentor her. Carries a LUMA card authorizing her metahuman activity. Trains with Sam in an abandoned Tacony lot (Ch. 109), where Sam discovers her repulsion fields can enable hovering, ground-skating, and projectile acceleration (launching baseballs at approximately 70 mph one-handed, 90-100 mph two-handed). Her projectile technique is described as "Kamehamehadouken" when she puts both hands together. Learns wrist escapes and basic combat techniques from Sam. Asks about joining the Young Defenders, but Sam deflects awkwardly. Confronted by Zero and Pattinson's Pals during a training session in Chapter 109; powers are negated at range, forcing Sam and Maggie to flee through the streets of Tacony until they escape Zero's range. Shows her LUMA card to Zero, who ignores it. Once clear of Zero's range, does a backflip in midair, giggling. Arrives at the Tacony Music Hall, where she meets Jordan, Spindle, and Tasha and is formally welcomed to the proto-Auditors team - Jordan asks about kevlar and Maggie reveals she only has elbow pads, knee pads, and a helmet. Benched from field work initially but continues training with Sam.

Mrs. O'Brien is shown chatting with Rachel Small on the Smalls' front stoop like old friends. Goes on her first real patrol with Sam through Mayfair in early November - wears a costume of bright red sports equipment including shin guards, elbow pads, a battered bike helmet, thick goggles, and a black cloth facemask (described as a cross between a roller derby player and a post-apocalyptic road warrior). Calls Sam "Bloodpuppy." During patrol, uses repulsion fields to gently rattle a tree branch so a stuck cat descends. Discusses comic books (a fan of "Johnny the Homicidal Maniac") and tells Sam she gets "leader vibes" off her.

Skates above Mudslide's quicksand floor on her foot-based repulsion fields while Sam is trapped. Cut on her side by glass shards Mudslide hurled through her sports padding. Launches pebble buckshot at Mudslide, leaving fifteen bloody pockmarks across his face and chest. Shot three times in the chest by Mudslide (Ch. 135) but protected by Sam's old bulletproof vest from the Music Hall, which she secretly took. Sustains broken ribs, internal bleeding, and possible organ damage despite the vest absorbing the impacts. Goes berserk - screaming at the top of her lungs, moving almost too fast to track despite her injuries, running on pure adrenaline. Attempts to crush Mudslide's skull with her repulsion fields, his face turning red and blood trickling from his nose under the pressure. Sam shouts "Flash!" three times but Maggie cannot hear (deafened from gunshots); Sam finally stops her by shouting "MAGGIE!" and yanking her arm. Treated by paramedics. Multiplex acknowledges her: "I can tell from the ramshackle costume and the life-threatening injuries that you're a student of the Bloodhound school of superheroism" (corrects himself: "The Diane school"). Multiplex offers to contact her parents with an excuse for injuries. Heads to CHOP (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia).
