## Background

Illya Myronovych Fedorov is a Ukrainian national and former nuclear engineer whose body continuously emits lethal ionizing radiation. Born in 1985 in Kyiv, he studied at Taras Shevchenko National University and earned a Masters in Nuclear Engineering from Kyiv Polytechnic before working at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. His Activation Event occurred during a reactor malfunction (details redacted). Unable to safely exist near people without shielding, he constructed improvised mechanical armor to contain his emissions, though it leaked and could never fully suppress them.

Before the main story, Illya killed Professor Franklin (March 23, 2017) and severely injured Liberty Belle roughly two years before the narrative begins. Despite this, the NSRA maintained a covert arrangement exploiting his radiation to power substations in exchange for his freedom. His overriding motivation was always survival and reunion with his wife Olena and daughter Yulia in Ukraine. After fatally wounding Liberty Belle at the PES refinery (Arc 3) and being confronted by Sam Small in the subway tunnels (Arc 4), Illya surrendered at the Philadelphia Federal Building on February 23, 2024, citing "a conversation with a young girl." He was tried, convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to 50 years at Aurora Springs Residential Facility.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file. Illya is classified informally by the superhero community and NSRA as an extremely dangerous radiation emitter, but no formal PERKS document for him has been presented in the story.

### Abilities

- **Ionizing Radiation Emission** - Illya's body continuously emits ionizing radiation at lethal levels. Without his containment suit, direct exposure causes severe radiation poisoning, internal microwave burns, and potentially fatal injury within minutes. Sam Small sustained over 10 Grays of radiation exposure during their confrontation, a dose that would be lethal to ordinary humans.
- **Mechanized Containment Suit** - Illya constructed and operated a seven-to-eight-foot-tall hazard-colored mechanical suit designed to contain his radiation. The suit featured pile-driver weapons capable of firing metal spikes, steam vents that released scalding vapor, reinforced armor plating, and hydraulic-powered limbs. The suit hissed and groaned with each movement and had an observable "input lag" between Illya's physical actions and the suit's mechanical response.
- **Technical Knowledge** - As a nuclear engineer, Illya possesses deep expertise in radiation containment, including knowledge of proper shielding materials such as lead, boron, silicon-based sealants, aluminum foil layers, and concrete. After his surrender, he provided detailed technical advice to the hazmat-suited workers preparing his containment cell, including specifying the proper sealant type and layering order. He also designed and provided schematics for his own specialized containment cell, which the court acknowledged during his arraignment.

### Limitations

- **Uncontrollable Radiation** - Cannot turn off or modulate his output. Normal human contact is impossible without heavy shielding.
- **Suit Dependency** - The improvised suit leaked and, once sufficiently damaged, could not contain his emissions.
- **Mechanical Lag** - Hydraulic delay between his intentions and the suit's movements - an exploitable weakness Sam used during their fight (Arc 4).

### Training & Skills

- Trained nuclear engineer with expertise in radiation physics, containment design, and materials science. Designed his own containment suit and later his Aurora Springs cell schematics.
- Literate and philosophical, drawing on Harlan Ellison and religious texts in conversation.
- Jewish upbringing; knowledgeable in Hebrew prayer and Jewish cultural traditions, a heritage he shares with Sam.

## Personality

Illya is introspective, articulate, and deeply sorrowful. He speaks with a Ukrainian accent and engages in philosophical debate even during combat, invoking literary and religious references - quoting Harlan Ellison, referencing the Dybbuk from Jewish folklore, and comparing himself to the Maccabees and Moses. Beneath his capacity for violence is a man defined by grief and desperation, whose overriding concern was always his family.

In containment, he applied his engineering mind to everything - offering technical corrections to workers building his cell, maintaining meticulous mental counts of its dimensions, and keeping a collection of jelly beans (stored in his suit's emptied pile-driver barrel) as a small comfort. He contemplated the racial dynamics of his treatment, noting officers showed him "guarded empathy" he acknowledged might differ had he not been white. He is not a villain in any conventional sense but a man trapped in a terrible situation who caused terrible harm trying to survive and return to his family.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary / Catalyst for surrender | Witnessed his battle with Belle (Arc 3), then fought him alone in the subway tunnels (Arc 4). Sam appealed to his humanity rather than killing him, directly causing his surrender. Refers to him as "Illya," never "Chernobyl." |
| Diane Williams (Liberty Belle) | Adversary (deceased) | Illya severely injured Belle two years before the story and fatally wounded her at the PES refinery. He tried to dissuade her from fighting. |
| Professor Franklin | Victim (deceased) | Killed by Illya on March 23, 2017 at an industrial factory. This act defined his reputation as a dangerous villain. |
| Yulia Fedorov (Yulia Illyinichna Fedorova) | Daughter | Born 2008, approximately Sam's age. Illya's primary emotional anchor; Sam's request to "pretend I'm Yulia" broke through his defenses. Visits him at Aurora Springs through lead glass. |
| Olena Fedorov | Wife | High school science teacher in Kyiv. Tracked his situation throughout his fugitive years; assured him the family was never angry, only sad. Visits him at Aurora Springs. |
| Gerald "Jerry" Caldwell | Defense attorney | Showed trust by forgoing protective gear during their first meeting. Strategy focused on showing Illya's "humanity" and arguing actions were taken "to avoid greater harm." Illya was moved to tears by the offer of genuine help. Later hired by Sam's parents for her own legal defense (Arc 15). |
| Agent Evelyn Shaw | NSRA handler | Questioned Illya after his surrender; provided a lawyer list for his "years of dedicated service." Her trial testimony exposed the NSRA arrangement; she invoked the Fifth when pressed. |
| Anne-Marie Gibson | Prosecutor | Led the case against Illya, later also involved in Sam's testimony preparation. |
| Riya Kapoor | Legal staff | Caldwell's paralegal; wore full protective gear to the containment cell meeting. |
| Judge Harold Bennett | Presiding judge | Presided over arraignment; set pre-trial timeline through trial commencement August 15, 2024. |
| Maxwell Martinez (Crossroads) | Brief ally | Warned Illya not to intervene during the courthouse attack because Deathgirl could copy his radiation. They shared a moment of solidarity as both waited out the crisis. |
| NSRA | Former coerced partner | Exploited his radiation to power substations while publicly treating him as a fugitive. Exposed during trial. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Listed among villains Sam researches on NetSphere forums while investigating Liberty Belle's injuries in Chapter 3. Identified as radiation-linked with scrubbed forum presence and only blurry photos remaining.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Main

    Liberty Belle reveals Illya's identity and history to the Young Defenders at an emergency briefing, disclosing that he killed Professor Franklin and nearly killed her. The Kingdom of Keys is discovered to be following behind Illya's movements to steal materials. On the first night of Hanukkah, Illya arrives in Philadelphia, triggering city-wide evacuation. At the abandoned PES refinery, he confronts Liberty Belle, revealing his government arrangement and accusing her of being possessed by Franklin's ghost. Despite attempting to dissuade Belle from fighting, their battle ends with Illya fatally wounding her with a pile-driver spike. He tells Sam to tend to Belle and warns her not to follow him.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam inherits Liberty Belle's detective files, including a notebook on Illya revealing his background as a Ukrainian nuclear engineer with government protection. The Auditors discover the NSRA's covert arrangement with Illya. Agent Torres reveals Illya has been hiding in Philadelphia's abandoned subway tunnels near the old Arch Street Subway station. Sam confronts Illya alone underground, engaging him in both physical combat and philosophical debate about justice, survival, and responsibility. Sam dismantles his suit, forces him out of it, and embraces him rather than killing him, asking him to pretend she is Yulia. Illya briefly returns the embrace before retreating into his damaged suit. Sam suffers near-fatal radiation exposure. On February 23, 2024, Illya surrenders at the Philadelphia Federal Building, requesting incarceration at Aurora Springs and visitation with his family.

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Supporting (Interludes)

    Interlude IF.1 covers a Philadelphia Inquirer article about Illya's surprise surrender on February 23, 2024, noting he requested incarceration at Aurora Springs and visitation with his family; the NSRA publicly claims credit for the outcome. Interlude IF.2 (late February/early March 2024) provides his perspective in containment: he observes hazmat-suited workers preparing his cell and offers technical advice about materials (silicon-based sealant, lead layers, boron, aluminum foil), while the cell gradually shrinks as 18 inches of concrete blocks are added to each wall. Agent Shaw questions him via camera link; he vaguely references "a conversation with a young girl" and reveals his primary motivation as concern for his wife and daughter. He contemplates the racial dynamics of his treatment and maintains meticulous counts of his cell dimensions. Caldwell arrives with paralegal Riya Kapoor, foregoes protective gear to show trust, and discusses strategy under attorney-client privilege. Illya discusses the deaths of Professor Franklin and Liberty Belle, characterizing his actions as "never without provocation, always in self-defense" while acknowledging he sought to minimize harm. He is moved to tears when paralegal Riya Kapoor affirms they are genuinely on his side, and smiles when Caldwell confirms Sam is "alive and recovering well." Sam watches news coverage of Illya's case from her hospital bed (Ch. 64), feeling an unnamed emotion about her unacknowledged role in his surrender.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting (Interlude)

    In Interlude IF.3 (spring 2024), Illya appears in federal court for arraignment. Spectators wear lead smocks for radiation protection. Judge Bennett lists formal charges: two counts second-degree murder for Professor Franklin and Liberty Belle, four counts theft, three counts property damage exceeding $500,000, illegal generation/release of hazardous materials, and seven counts unlicensed use of superhuman abilities. Illya voluntarily waives bail citing public safety, pleads not guilty based on necessity rather than denial, and provides containment cell schematics. The court erupts in murmurs at his plea, requiring gavel intervention. Judge Bennett sets the precise legal timeline through trial commencement August 15, 2024. A bailiff escorts Illya with unexpected empathy.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam prepares testimony for Illya's trial with prosecutor Mrs. Anne-Marie Gibson, uncovering further evidence of the NSRA's past collaboration with him. Sam testifies on Day 4 of the trial, presenting video evidence of Liberty Belle's death. Defense attorney Caldwell cross-examines Sam and introduces a handwritten note allegedly from Belle inviting Illya to the refinery. Over nine days, the trial reveals Illya's self-defense claims, expert testimony on his radiation dangers, and the shocking NSRA arrangement exposed through Agent Shaw's testimony. During the Philly Phreaks' attack on the courthouse, Interlude IF.4 provides Illya's POV as he watches the chaos from inside the courtroom. He rises to help but Crossroads warns him that Deathgirl could copy his radiation powers with no containment suit, which would turn her into a walking nuclear meltdown and kill everyone in Philadelphia. Illya reluctantly sits back down, and Crossroads flips a coin and gives him a grim smile - a spark of trust and solidarity. Illya recites the Hashkiveinu prayer for his daughter and for Sam's safety. He is found guilty of manslaughter and other charges.

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Illya's sentencing is covered in Chapter 107. He receives 50 years in prison to be served at Aurora Springs Residential Facility (not Daedalus). The sentence proves controversial: manslaughter rather than murder suggests self-defense, Aurora Springs is perceived as lenient, and the NSRA's involvement complicates public perception. Patriot incites protests in response. Sam watches the sentencing with her family and Maggie. In Interlude IF.5, Illya arrives at Aurora Springs and settles into his new life. He reflects on his guilt and his family: his wife Olena and daughter Yulia, both living in Kyiv. He establishes a routine of exercise, engineering work (designing portable radiation shielding), and radiation purges. Dr. Chen serves as his chief medical officer and Ms. Patel as his case worker. He has a video call with his family and later a physical visit through lead glass. He finds renewed purpose in his engineering work and family reconnection. He recalls his grandmother's Yiddish saying: "Man plans, God laughs."

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam notes she is back in peak physical form after being irradiated by Illya. Mrs. Gibson keeps Sam updated on Illya's status: he is settling in peacefully at Aurora Springs and serving his time. Sam corrects people who refer to him as "the guy who nuked me," insisting on calling him "Illya" - respecting his personhood.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam briefly thinks about Illya, hoping he is okay at Aurora Springs and wondering if the facility is looking into Vysera. Separately, Sam's parents hire Gerald Caldwell - identified as Illya's former defense attorney - for Sam's own legal defense. Caldwell secures Sam's release with an ankle monitor after she is arrested during a confrontation with a shapeshifter impersonating her.


## Trivia

- Illya's blood appears "white" rather than red when sensed through Sam's blood-sensing abilities, likely due to radiation altering his physiology.
- The Harlan Ellison work he quoted during the Belle confrontation ("I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream") is identified as his wife's favorite.
- His mechanical suit stood seven to eight feet tall with hazard-colored markings (orange and yellow-green).
- The PES refinery where he fought Liberty Belle was also where he killed Professor Franklin years earlier.
- Reference images exist for the character depicting both his appearance and his suit.
- Outside the suit, he stands approximately 5'8" to 5'9" with greying curly hair, broad shoulders, a vertical scar across his left eye, and eyes that glow pale orange with no visible pupils. When he breathes uncontained, a peal of orange light escapes his mouth.
- He funneled money from his NSRA "consulting work" to his family in Ukraine through offshore accounts and anonymous wire transfers.
- The formal charges at his arraignment totaled seventeen counts across five categories, the most unusual being seven counts of "unlicensed utilization of superhuman abilities." Additional charges including illegal immigration were introduced during trial.
- His not-guilty plea was based on necessity rather than denial - he acknowledged his actions but maintained they were taken to avoid greater harm.
