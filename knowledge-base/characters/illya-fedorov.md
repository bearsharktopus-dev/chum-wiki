## Background

Illya Myronovych Fedorov is a Ukrainian national and former nuclear engineer whose body emits lethal ionizing radiation. The circumstances of how he acquired this condition are not fully detailed, but his technical expertise as an engineer informs his understanding of his own powers and the containment measures required to manage them. Unable to safely exist among other people without shielding, Illya constructed improvised mechanical armor to contain his radiation output, though the suit leaked and could never fully suppress his emissions.

Before the events of the main story, Illya killed Professor Franklin, Liberty Belle's mentor and predecessor among the Delaware Valley Defenders, approximately eight years prior to the story's start (around 2015). He also severely injured Liberty Belle herself roughly two years before the main narrative begins. Despite these acts, the National Superhuman Response Agency entered into a covert arrangement with Illya, using his radiation to power electrical substations in exchange for his freedom. This arrangement meant the government was effectively enabling his continued existence outside containment while publicly treating him as a fugitive.

Illya's primary motivation throughout the story was survival and his desire to reunite with his wife and daughter, Yulia, who remained in Ukraine. He wore his mechanical suit not as a weapon but as a means of containing the danger his body posed to everyone around him. When Liberty Belle lured him to the abandoned PES refinery for a final confrontation on the first night of Hanukkah 2023, their battle ended with Illya fatally wounding her. Months later, Sam Small tracked Illya to the abandoned subway tunnels beneath Philadelphia and confronted him alone. Rather than killing him, Sam dismantled his suit and appealed to his humanity, embracing him and asking him to pretend she was Yulia. This encounter profoundly affected Illya. On February 23, 2024, he surrendered to authorities on the steps of the Philadelphia Federal Building, citing "a conversation with a young girl" as his reason.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file. Illya is classified informally by the superhero community and NSRA as an extremely dangerous radiation emitter, but no formal PERKS document for him has been presented in the story.

### Abilities

- **Ionizing Radiation Emission** - Illya's body continuously emits ionizing radiation at lethal levels. Without his containment suit, direct exposure causes severe radiation poisoning, internal microwave burns, and potentially fatal injury within minutes. Sam Small sustained over 10 Grays of radiation exposure during their confrontation, a dose that would be lethal to ordinary humans.
- **Mechanized Containment Suit** - Illya constructed and operated a seven-to-eight-foot-tall hazard-colored mechanical suit designed to contain his radiation. The suit featured pile-driver weapons capable of firing metal spikes, steam vents that released scalding vapor, reinforced armor plating, and hydraulic-powered limbs. The suit hissed and groaned with each movement and had an observable "input lag" between Illya's physical actions and the suit's mechanical response.
- **Technical Knowledge** - As a nuclear engineer, Illya possesses deep expertise in radiation containment, including knowledge of proper shielding materials such as lead, boron, silicon-based sealants, aluminum foil layers, and concrete. After his surrender, he provided detailed technical advice to the hazmat-suited workers preparing his containment cell, including specifying the proper sealant type and layering order. He also designed and provided schematics for his own specialized containment cell, which the court acknowledged during his arraignment.

### Limitations

- **Uncontrollable Radiation** - Illya cannot turn off or modulate his radiation output. His body is a constant danger to everyone in his proximity, making normal human contact impossible without heavy shielding.
- **Suit Dependency** - Without his mechanical suit, Illya is exposed and his radiation harms everyone nearby, including himself emotionally, as he cannot interact with other people. The suit was improvised and prone to leaking radiation, and once sufficiently damaged it could not contain his emissions.
- **Isolation** - His condition renders him incapable of physical human contact. He cannot touch, embrace, or be near his own family without endangering their lives.
- **Mechanical Lag** - The suit's hydraulic systems exhibited a delay between his intentions and the suit's movements, an exploitable weakness that Sam used during their fight.

### Training & Skills

- Trained nuclear engineer with expertise in radiation physics, containment design, and materials science.
- Literate and philosophical, drawing on literary references including Harlan Ellison and religious texts in conversation.
- Knowledgeable in Hebrew prayer, suggesting cultural or religious familiarity beyond his Ukrainian background.
- Capable mechanical engineer who designed and maintained his own containment suit.

## Personality

Illya is an introspective, articulate, and deeply sorrowful individual. He speaks with a Ukrainian accent and engages in philosophical debate even during combat, invoking historical and literary references to frame his actions. During his confrontation with Liberty Belle, he quoted from Harlan Ellison and referenced the concept of the Dybbuk, a possessing spirit from Jewish folklore, accusing Belle of being haunted by Professor Franklin's ghost. He challenged Sam's understanding of justice by citing examples of self-defense and survival, comparing himself to the Maccabees and Moses.

Beneath his capacity for violence lies a man defined by grief and desperation. Illya's overriding concern was always his family -- his wife and daughter Yulia -- whom he could never safely be near. During his containment following surrender, he contemplated the racial dynamics of his treatment, noting that officers showed him "guarded empathy" rather than hostility -- a reflection he acknowledged might differ had he not been white. He wept when his attorney confirmed Sam had survived their encounter, and he silently recited a Hebrew prayer for his daughter and for Sam during the Philly Phreaks' attack on the courthouse. He kept a collection of jelly beans in his containment cell, including popcorn flavor, as a small comfort. He maintained meticulous mental counts of his cell's dimensions and materials, watching the space gradually shrink as 18 inches of concrete blocks were added to each wall. He observed the marble courtroom during his arraignment with analytical detachment while spectators wore lead smocks for protection, and maintained his composure even as the court reacted with murmurs to his not-guilty plea. His surrender was not motivated by defeat but by Sam's compassion reaching something inside him that years of conflict had not. He is not a villain in any conventional sense; he is a man trapped in a terrible situation who caused terrible harm while trying to survive and return to the people he loved.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary / Catalyst for surrender | Sam confronted Illya twice: once witnessing his battle with Liberty Belle, and once fighting him alone in the subway tunnels. Rather than killing him, Sam appealed to his humanity. Sam refers to him as "Illya" rather than "Chernobyl." Her compassion directly led to his surrender. |
| Diane Williams (Liberty Belle) | Adversary (deceased) | Illya severely injured Belle two years before the main story and fatally wounded her at the PES refinery. Their relationship was complex; he tried to dissuade her from fighting and acknowledged their shared history. |
| Professor Franklin | Victim (deceased) | Illya killed Franklin approximately eight years before the main story (around 2015), an act that defined his reputation as a dangerous villain. |
| Yulia Fedorov | Daughter | Illya's primary emotional anchor. His desire to see Yulia drove many of his actions. Sam's request to "pretend I'm Yulia" during their final confrontation broke through his defenses. |
| Olena Fedorov | Wife | Lives in Kyiv, Ukraine. Illya requested visitation with her upon surrendering. Visits him at Aurora Springs through lead glass alongside Yulia. His separation from his family is central to his tragedy. |
| Gerald "Jerry" Caldwell | Defense attorney | Caldwell agreed to represent Illya and showed genuine trust by forgoing protective gear during their first meeting, while his paralegal Riya Kapoor wore full protective equipment. He discussed attorney-client privilege-protected strategy focused on showing "context" and Illya's "humanity," arguing actions were taken "to avoid greater harm." Illya initially questioned whether Caldwell's representation was a government trick but was moved to tears by the offer of genuine help. Caldwell also confirmed Sam was "alive and recovering well" and suggested avoiding calling her as a witness. |
| Agent Evelyn Shaw | NSRA handler | Shaw appeared via camera link to question Illya following his surrender, demanding explanation for his unexpected change of heart. She expressed skepticism when Illya vaguely referenced "a conversation with a young girl." Her later testimony at trial revealed the NSRA's covert arrangement with him. |
| Anne-Marie Gibson | Prosecutor | Led the prosecution against Illya, building a case on his past crimes including the deaths of Professor Franklin and Liberty Belle. |
| Riya Kapoor | Legal staff | Caldwell's paralegal who accompanied him to the containment cell wearing full protective gear. Assisted in assuring Illya of the defense team's genuine commitment to his case. |
| Judge Harold Bennett | Presiding judge | Presided over Illya's arraignment at Philadelphia Federal Courthouse. Set precise pre-trial timeline with motions deadline April 1, discovery May 15, status hearing June 5, pre-trial conference July 20, and trial commencement August 15, 2024. Reaffirmed Illya's rights to fair trial, representation, and silence. |
| Maxwell Martinez (Crossroads) | Brief ally | During the Philly Phreaks' courthouse attack, Crossroads warned Illya not to intervene because Deathgirl could copy his powers. Crossroads showed Illya a gesture of trust by flipping a coin. |
| NSRA | Former coerced partner | The NSRA maintained a secret arrangement exploiting Illya's radiation to power substations, effectively enabling his freedom while using him as an asset. This arrangement was exposed during his trial. |

## Trivia

- Sam Small consistently refers to him as "Illya" rather than "Chernobyl." The codename "Chernobyl" was assigned to him by the government, and he hates it.
- The character reference guide explicitly describes him as "not a bad guy, just a guy who was in a bad situation" and "extremely sympathetic."
- Illya's blood appears "white" rather than red when sensed through Sam's blood-sensing abilities, likely due to the radiation altering his physiology.
- He quoted from Harlan Ellison's "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream" during his confrontation with Liberty Belle, drawing parallels between his existence in the mechanical suit and being a sentient being trapped without agency.
- He keeps a collection of jelly beans in his containment cell, with popcorn flavor mentioned specifically.
- Illya recites Hebrew prayers despite being Ukrainian, suggesting interfaith or cross-cultural familiarity.
- His mechanical suit was described as seven to eight feet tall and colored in hazard markings (yellow and black).
- The PES refinery where he fought Liberty Belle was also the location where he killed Professor Franklin years earlier.
- There are reference images for the character: "illya federov.png" (his appearance) and "chernobyl.png" / "chernobylmech.png" / "chernobylmech 2.png" (his mechanical suit).
- During his trial, he voluntarily waived bail and provided schematics for his own containment cell, demonstrating cooperation and concern for public safety.
- His containment cell was progressively shrunk by 18 inches on each wall through concrete block additions, a process Illya observed with engineering detachment while offering technical corrections to the workers.
- The courtroom spectators at his arraignment wore lead smocks for radiation protection, underscoring the unique danger he posed even in legal proceedings.
- Illya's not-guilty plea was based on necessity rather than denial of his actions; he internally acknowledged what he had done but maintained the legal position that his actions were taken to avoid greater harm.
- His defense attorney Caldwell's decision to forgo protective gear during their first meeting was a deliberate gesture of trust that moved Illya, contrasting with paralegal Riya Kapoor who wore full protective equipment.
- Illya noted that officers treated him with "guarded empathy" rather than hostility during his containment, a dynamic he reflected on through the lens of racial politics.
- The formal charges at his arraignment totaled seventeen counts across six categories, the most unusual being seven counts of "unlicensed use of superhuman abilities."
- The pre-trial legal timeline set at his arraignment ran from April through August 2024, establishing a parallel timeline to Sam's recovery arc in Intermission 4.5.
