## Background

Bianca Agnelli is a former Philadelphia firefighter and the primary gadgeteer of the Delaware Valley Defenders. Her identity is public record and she operates as a federal employee. Her firefighting background directly shaped her Tinker-type power, which lets her build virtually any device with a tangential connection to firefighting. Despite no formal engineering degree, she designs and maintains specialized equipment for the entire team - from surveillance robots to custom hearing aids - though she has not revealed the full extent of her capabilities to anyone outside the DVD's core membership.

Bianca has been with the DVD since before Sam Small's recruitment in August 2023, and gradually became one of Sam's closest adult confidants. She contributed to the DVD Training Curriculum in July 2016 alongside Professor Franklin, Diane Williams, Kwame Adjei, and Peregrine, leading the mobility training component.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Tinker-Type Creation (Firefighting-Themed)** - Can design and construct virtually any device with at least a tangential connection to firefighting. This broad umbrella covers thermal protection, structural engineering, hazmat handling, communications, search and rescue, breathing apparatus, chemical suppression, and emergency logistics.
- **Surveillance Robotics** - Builds robots that provide remote surveillance feeds during field operations.
- **Emergency Communications Equipment** - Designed emergency pagers with "forever batteries" distributed to all Young Defenders (Book 3).
- **Fire Suppression & Protection Gear** - Lightweight fire blankets, foam capsules, and foldable smoke masks with advanced filtration. Provided to Sam during the Coyotes arson crisis (Book 9).
- **Custom Hearing Aid (for Devonte Harris)** - Fireproof hearing aid with echolocation mode, engineered to exploit Devonte's sound-stealing power by letting him steal from the device's playback rather than the source environment.
- **Bomb Detection and Disposal Systems** - Bomb-detecting robot (deployed Book 3) and bomb-disposing centipede bot (deployed Book 13 during the Shrike manhunt).
- **Fire Safety Inspection Equipment** - Conducts fire safety assessments using her expertise and specialized technology.

### Limitations

- Bianca's Tinker-type power is constrained by its thematic requirement: all creations must relate, even tangentially, to firefighting. The precise boundaries of what qualifies as "tangentially related" are not fully documented.
- She has not revealed the full extent of her capabilities to individuals outside the DVD's core membership, making a comprehensive assessment of her upper limits impossible from available information.
- Her inventions appear to require conventional construction time and materials rather than instant manifestation, distinguishing her from pure Create-type metahumans.

### Training & Skills

- Former professional firefighter with extensive knowledge of fire behavior, structural assessment, hazmat, and emergency response.
- Trained in registered superhuman team protocols, including rules of engagement, chain of evidence, and law enforcement coordination.
- Practical engineering and fabrication skills complement her Tinker-type power despite no formal degree.
- Leads DVD mobility training with access to a dedicated facility in the Aramingo area.
- Experienced field combatant; has sustained injuries on multiple operations (Books 8, 14).

## Personality

Bianca is aggressive, hotheaded, and reckless - her teammates characterize her approach as "cowboy cop tendencies," placing her at the impulsive end of the DVD's spectrum opposite Multiplex's rigid discipline. A smoker with a scratchy, rasping voice, she almost certainly has ADHD, drifting toward gear specs during briefings. Despite her hot-headedness, she has a functional grasp of due process; her frustration lies in the emotional difficulty of waiting when action could help.

Her maternal instinct is equally prominent. She is fiercely protective of younger heroes, particularly Sam, blending mentorship with genuine familial warmth. As the only openly queer adult in Sam's immediate orbit, she serves as a natural anchor and confidant. She advocates strongly for recruiting fresh perspectives and clashes with more cautious colleagues like Multiplex over institutional change.

    First referenced in Chapter 5 via her locker at DVD headquarters during Sam's tour of the facility with Liberty Belle. Present only as a background name among the adult Defenders.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Introduced in Chapter 15 as an adult Delaware Valley Defenders member, described as a firefighter-themed hero in a bright orange jacket over a sleek black leotard, with tanned skin and faint scars from fire battles. Present at the team meeting reviewing drone footage of the Kingdom of Keys murder. Calls Sam her "protege" (Sam was unaware of this designation). Sam's crush on Fury Forge begins intensifying during this chapter.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Deploys a bomb-disposal robot equipped with cameras and two fire extinguishers to provide remote adult oversight during the Young Defenders' South Street operation against the Philly Phreaks (Ch. 32), though the robot is destroyed in the ensuing windstorm. Distributes emergency pagers with "forever batteries" to all Young Defenders in Chapter 37 after the emergency meeting regarding Chernobyl's potential alliance with the Kingdom - candy-bar sized plastic devices with antennas, red LEDs, and city-wide range. Arrives at the PES refinery following Liberty Belle's death by Chernobyl.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Minor

    Attends Liberty Belle's will reading at the Goldman, Reid & Miller law firm in Center City (Ch. 46). Arrives sweaty and out of breath, having run to the event. Too uncomfortable to speak to Sam directly, she simply looks at her and scatters.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Interrogates Sparkplug (Christian Praznik) alongside Multiplex after his apprehension in Chapter 85. Present at the joint hero meeting at DVD headquarters where the team analyzes Rogue Wave's operations alongside members from the Tacony Titans. Reports that Sparkplug was a "true believer" but didn't know much about the organization's inner workings.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Interlude / Supporting

    Stars in Interlude BA.1, her only first-person POV appearance. The interlude takes place the day after Sam's late-night visit following the Jamila breakup (Ch. 88-89). Bianca participates in a DVD meeting with Jamal, Elijah (Multiplex), Clara, and Kwame (Bulwark) about the upcoming Chernobyl trial and its potential impact on Sam. Her ADHD tendencies are on display as she drifts toward thoughts of gear specs and blueprints during Elijah's briefing. Clara expresses concern about defense attorney Jerry Caldwell's tendency to elevate metahuman affairs over questions of guilt or innocence. When Kwame raises the trial's potential toll on Sam, Bianca brushes it off, calling Sam "no shrinking violet" and expressing confidence in her resilience. Reveals that Sam showed up "bawling on my doorstep" around eleven the previous night, and that Bianca gave her the spare room (noting her kids were already asleep). Elijah attributes Sam's attachment to Bianca as the "orientation factor" - Bianca being the only openly queer adult in Sam's orbit. Bianca and Elijah clash sharply over differing attitudes toward Sam's emotional state, with Jamal intervening to remind them of team unity. Bianca then advocates alongside Kwame for recruiting metahumans from outside the established system, while Elijah and Clara express reservations about bureaucratic complications.

    Also present at the pivotal DVD meeting in Chapter 91 where four Jump incidents in eighteen hours are discussed. Fury Forge was personally involved in resolving the Dakota Lyons pyrokinetic incident in Manayunk. During the Chernobyl trial protests (Ch. 97), sides with the adults on following NSRA orders to contain protests, though conflicted - described as a "mother bear staring down our faults." Challenges Sam directly: "Is your ideology worth more than actually protecting people?" Present at the post-Phreaks-attack debriefing (Ch. 99) alongside the other senior DVD members.

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Listed among the DVD members present at the full team meeting in Chapter 113 following Patriot's homecoming dance attack on Sam, flanking Multiplex alongside Crossroads.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the DVD debrief (Ch. 125) tinkering with a gadget while the team analyzes intelligence from the Young Defenders' various encounters, asking practical questions and insisting the team can't "sit on hands." In Chapter 128, alongside Captain Plasma, she sternly debriefs Sam and Rampart after their unauthorized gang confrontation at the 9th Street construction site, directly questioning whether they escalated a volatile situation. Acknowledges systemic failure in mentorship: "We've been failing you kids, and that's on us." Expresses concern about possible Rogue Wave-related mind control. The Young Defenders are grounded pending reevaluation. At Devonte's hospital room (Ch. 131), coordinates Operation Ivory preparations by contacting zookeepers and zoo security she personally knows, and promises Devonte the best hearing implants money can buy after he is deafened by a gunshot. Arrives at the Philadelphia Zoo on an ATV alongside Crossroads during the Kingdom's zoo heist (Ch. 133), deploying smoke grenades and expanding foam in combat (Ch. 134). Suffers a broken arm during the battle and is seen afterward in a sling, arguing with paramedics.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Inspects Tacony Charter Academy's fire safety systems following Aaron McKinley's arson campaign (Ch. 142), arriving at the school in her sleek black and red suit with a huge backpack of firefighting gadgets to coordinate with the fire marshal. Provides Sam with specialized firefighting equipment framed as a "beta test for new student emergency preparedness initiative" (Ch. 143) - a lightweight fire blanket, foam capsules for fire suppression, and a foldable smoke mask that filters airborne toxins including carbon monoxide. Advises Sam on firefighting fundamentals: "First rule of firefighting: you can't save anyone if you're dead." This gear proves critical during Sam's confrontation with Aaron at the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge, with the oxygen mask saving Derek Taylor's life. The adult DVD members are largely absent during the arson crisis, occupied with a three-day blockade at Penn Medicine caused by the villain Professor Poppet.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced among senior DVD members during the SARA legislation period and Young Defenders dissolution.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    Present at DVD headquarters in Chapter 177 when Sam delivers the Stheno Pharmaceuticals flash drive and Hypeman sample. Joins Multiplex and Councilman Davis in confronting Sam about the warehouse raid, furiously declaring "I'm not having any more kids die under my watch!" The exchange escalates into a heated argument about tactics and Liberty Belle's legacy, with Sam pushing back by asking what Belle would have done.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present during DVD team meetings and strategy sessions responding to Kingdom and Rogue Wave threats.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Supporting

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Responds alongside Bulwark to the Van Kirk construction site during the climactic confrontation between Sam and Shrike (Ch. 208). Arrives wearing a chemical mask, domino mask, and speakers, taking command of the scene after Sam's initial capture of Shrike. When Shrike's skinhead followers provoke police and Shrike breaks free from the NSRA containment vehicle on Hypeman, Bulwark goes down with serious injuries requiring ICU admission. Fury Forge is also injured during the chaos but less severely - treated and released, afterward seen on crutches.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Mentioned (Flashback)

    Referenced in the Interlude jb-1 (Professor Franklin) flashback to July 2016, where she is identified as a contributor to the DVD Training Curriculum. Described as having a firefighter background and gadgets/engineering expertise despite no engineering degree, with access to a training facility in Aramingo and responsibility for leading mobility training.


## Trivia

- Chose the codename "Fury Forge" because she thought it sounded cool, not for any deeper significance.
- Described through Sam's narration as brawny and muscular, with heavily inked tattoos from shoulders down and tanned skin with faint scars from fire battles.
- Sam's crush on Bianca is an open secret among the DVD. Bianca joked in Interlude BA.1 that Sam was "thirstier than a damn cactus" and "beaming horny little infrared pings my way." She calls Sam "little Miss Samwise."
- Habitually calls Clara Parker "Clarence" as a teasing nickname.
- Devonte's hearing aid qualifies as firefighting-adjacent through its connection to communication equipment used in emergency response - one of the most creative applications of her Tinker-type power.
- In Interlude BA.1, reflects fondly on Professor Franklin: "Ol' Professor Franklin really did know what he was doing when he laid the groundwork for this little passion project of his."
