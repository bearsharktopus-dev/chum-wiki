## Background

Bianca Agnelli is a former firefighter who became a member of the Delaware Valley Defenders, Philadelphia's only registered superhuman team. As a registered superhuman entity, her identity is public record and she operates as a federal employee. Prior to her superhero career, she served in the Philadelphia Fire Department, an experience that directly shaped the nature of her Tinker-type power and her aggressive, intervention-first approach to heroism.

Within the DVD, Bianca fills the role of the team's primary gadgeteer and tech specialist. She designs, builds, and maintains specialized equipment for herself and her teammates, leveraging her power's firefighting theme to produce an impressive range of devices. Her creations include surveillance robots, emergency pagers with perpetual batteries, fire suppression gear, advanced smoke filtration masks, and a custom hearing aid for the private investigator Devonte Harris. Despite this prolific output, Bianca has not revealed the full extent of her power level to Sam Small or other younger heroes, keeping her most capable inventions reserved for the DVD's internal use.

Bianca was already a member of the DVD during Sam Small's recruitment into the Young Defenders in August 2023, though she was initially present only as a name on a locker at the team's Center City headquarters. She became a more active presence in Sam's life over the course of the story, eventually serving as a personal confidant when Sam sought comfort at Bianca's home following her breakup with Jamila Fayad. Their bond, in part attributed by teammates to their shared queer identity, reflects Bianca's broader maternal protectiveness toward the younger heroes in the DVD's orbit.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Tinker-Type Creation (Firefighting-Themed)** - Bianca possesses a Tinker-type power that allows her to design and construct virtually any device or piece of technology, provided it has at least a tangential connection to firefighting. This broad thematic umbrella encompasses an extremely wide range of inventions, as firefighting touches on thermal protection, structural engineering, hazardous materials handling, communications, search and rescue, breathing apparatus, chemical suppression, and emergency response logistics.
- **Surveillance Robotics** - Has built robots capable of following superhero teams into the field to provide remote surveillance feeds to adult DVD members monitoring operations from headquarters. One such robot accompanied the Young Defenders during the Philly Phreaks confrontation on South Street.
- **Emergency Communications Equipment** - Designed and distributed emergency pagers equipped with "forever batteries" to all Young Defenders members following the revelation of Chernobyl's potential alliance with the Kingdom of Keys.
- **Fire Suppression & Protection Gear** - Created specialized firefighting equipment for field operatives, including lightweight fire blankets, foam capsules for fire suppression, and foldable smoke masks with advanced filtration systems. This equipment was provided to Sam during the Coyotes arson crisis.
- **Custom Hearing Aid (for Devonte Harris)** - Designed a hearing aid for Devonte Harris (Ventriloquist) after he was deafened in one ear by a gunshot during the Operation Ivory investigation. The device is engineered to exploit Devonte's sound-stealing power by allowing him to steal sounds from the hearing aid's playback rather than from the environment directly, enabling him to use his abilities without silencing the original source.
- **Bomb Detection Systems** - Built at least one bomb-detecting robot that was deployed during the Philly Phreaks battle, though it sustained damage during the conflict.
- **Fire Safety Inspection Equipment** - Conducts fire safety assessments using her expertise and technology, as demonstrated when she inspected Tacony Charter Academy's fire safety systems following the Coyotes' arson campaign.

### Limitations

- Bianca's Tinker-type power is constrained by its thematic requirement: all creations must relate, even tangentially, to firefighting. The precise boundaries of what qualifies as "tangentially related" are not fully documented.
- She has not revealed the full extent of her capabilities to individuals outside the DVD's core membership, making a comprehensive assessment of her upper limits impossible from available information.
- Her inventions appear to require conventional construction time and materials rather than instant manifestation, distinguishing her from pure Create-type metahumans.

### Training & Skills

- Former professional firefighter with extensive knowledge of fire behavior, structural assessment, hazardous materials, and emergency response procedures.
- Trained in the operational protocols of a registered superhuman team, including rules of engagement, chain of evidence procedures, and coordination with law enforcement.
- Possesses practical engineering and fabrication skills that complement her Tinker-type power, enabling her to translate her intuitive designs into functional technology.
- Experienced field combatant who has sustained injuries during operations, including during the Shrike confrontation at the Van Kirk construction site (treated and released from hospital).

## Personality

Bianca is defined by extremes of passion and protectiveness. She is aggressive, hotheaded, and reckless in a manner her teammates characterize as "cowboy cop tendencies," placing her at the impulsive end of the DVD's spectrum opposite Multiplex's rigid discipline. She almost certainly has ADHD, as evidenced by her attention drifting toward thoughts of new gear during briefings and her general difficulty with patience and restraint. Despite her hot-headedness, she has a functional grasp of due process and institutional rules; her frustration lies not in ignorance of why procedures exist but in the emotional difficulty of waiting when she knows action could help.

Her maternal instinct is one of her most prominent traits. She is fiercely protective of younger heroes, particularly Sam Small, whom she has taken under her wing in a way that blends mentorship with genuine familial warmth. When Sam appeared at Bianca's home after her breakup with Jamila, Bianca provided comfort without hesitation. Teammates have noted that Bianca's role as an openly queer adult in the DVD makes her a natural anchor for Sam, though Bianca's protectiveness extends to all the younger heroes regardless of identity. She advocates strongly for recruiting fresh perspectives and giving young metahumans opportunities, frequently clashing with more cautious colleagues like Multiplex over the pace of institutional change.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Mentee / Protectee | Bianca is fiercely protective of Sam and has served as an emotional confidant. Sam finds Bianca extremely physically attractive. Their bond was partly attributed by Elijah to their shared queer identity. Bianca provided Sam with specialized firefighting gear during the Coyotes crisis and inspected her school's fire safety systems. |
| Elijah Brooks (Multiplex) | Colleague / Foil | Bianca and Elijah represent opposite approaches within the DVD: her impulsive cowboy-cop tendencies versus his strict by-the-book discipline. They have clashed directly, including over how to handle Sam's emotional state, though mutual respect underlies their disagreements. |
| Kwame Adjei (Bulwark) | Colleague / Ideological Middle Ground | Kwame occupies the middle position between Bianca's recklessness and Multiplex's rigidity. They share frustration with institutional constraints but express it differently. Both responded to the Shrike crisis at the Van Kirk construction site, where Bulwark was seriously injured and Bianca was treated and released. |
| Devonte Harris (Ventriloquist) | Ally / Equipment Recipient | Bianca designed Devonte's custom hearing aid, which exploits his sound-stealing power by allowing him to steal from the device's playback rather than the source environment. She promised to help him with hearing implants after his injury during Operation Ivory. |
| Councilman Jamal Davis | Civilian Liaison | Jamal frequently mediates between Bianca and Elijah during DVD meetings and serves as the team's political coordinator. |
| Clara Parker | Colleague | The DVD's legal counsel. Bianca and Clara interact during team meetings and strategy sessions, with Clara handling the legal side while Bianca pushes for action. |
| Bianca's Wife | Spouse | Bianca is a happily married lesbian. Her wife's name and details have not been disclosed in the narrative. |
| Captain Plasma (Rodney Greene) | Colleague | Fellow DVD member. Bianca and Captain Plasma jointly debriefed Sam and Rampart after their unauthorized gang confrontation, expressing concern about possible mind control connected to Rogue Wave. |
| Rampart (Jason Reynolds) | Junior Colleague | Former Young Defender who graduated to the DVD. Bianca has interacted with Rampart in field and debriefing contexts. |
| Gerald "Jerry" Caldwell | Opposing Counsel | Defense attorney for Illya Fedorov (Chernobyl) during the trial in Book 6. Bianca internally described squaring off against him as facing "a legal buzzsaw" and dismissed his clients as "a mewling cadre of supervillain-sympathizers." Clara raised concerns about Caldwell's tendency to prioritize metahuman affairs over guilt or innocence during the DVD strategy meeting (Interlude BA.1). Caldwell later represented Sam Small in Book 15. |

## Trivia

- Bianca chose the codename "Fury Forge" because she thought it sounded cool, not because of any particular significance to her powers or background.
- She is described through Sam's narration as extremely physically attractive, with a muscular, large build and tattoos covering her body from the shoulders down.
- Bianca is one of the few openly queer adults in the DVD, which her colleague Elijah Brooks suggested is part of why Sam gravitates toward her as a confidant.
- The hearing aid she designed for Devonte Harris represents one of the most creative applications of her Tinker-type power, as it technically qualifies as firefighting-adjacent through its connection to communication equipment used in emergency response.
- Despite being described as having "cowboy cop tendencies," Bianca operates within a registered superhuman team that functions under federal employment rules and legal oversight, creating an inherent tension between her impulsive nature and her institutional obligations.
- Her current status as of the beginning of Arc 16 is simply listed as "N/A, presumably working," suggesting she remains active but has not been the focus of recent narrative developments.
- Bianca occupies a distinct ideological position within the DVD: she is more aggressive and action-oriented than Multiplex but shares Bulwark's frustration with institutional inertia, differing from Bulwark primarily in the specific reasons for her impatience.
