## Background

Devonte Harris was a fifteen-year-old running with a local gang in Philadelphia when Liberty Belle intervened to redirect his talents toward heroism. As a precursor to formal assignment with the Young Defenders, Belle insisted he acquire a JLUMA (juvenile license), and he was enrolled in the PERKS assessment system in 2021. Despite being evasive and combative with his interviewing officer, Devonte demonstrated a genuine interest in helping his local community and was accepted onto the team under the codename Playback.

Devonte served with the Young Defenders through several years of escalating crises, including the battles against the Philly Phreaks, Liberty Belle's terminal illness and death at the hands of Chernobyl, and the subsequent political upheaval surrounding superhuman oversight. He developed from a rebellious teenager into a more reliable operative, showing particular aptitude for stealth operations and intelligence gathering. He had a brief romantic relationship with teammate Amelia (Gossamer) that ended because of differences regarding his Christian faith and views on premarital sex.

In 2023, following the courthouse crisis and the team restructuring that saw Crossroads graduate to the senior Delaware Valley Defenders and Rampart assume leadership, Devonte resigned from the Young Defenders alongside Akilah Washington to pursue personal goals. He adopted the new codename Ventriloquist and transitioned into private investigation work at Chambers & Woo Investigations. He now assists with the ongoing investigation into the Kingdom of Keys, providing technical expertise in evidence analysis and surveillance. He was shot and deafened in one ear during an investigation of Operation Ivory at the docks, and now wears a hearing aid designed by Fury Forge that allows him to use his powers without removing sounds from the environment.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | F4/E/P/B |
| **Category** | Filch |
| **Power Ranking** | 4/10 |
| **Control** | 6/10 |
| **Hostility** | 4/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 2/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 3/10 |

### Abilities

- **Sound Marking** — Can mentally "mark" objects or individuals, allowing him to steal or play back sounds from those targets. Can theoretically mark a limitless number of objects, but practically limited to around 6 or 7 due to cognitive constraints. Marks are invisible and undetectable by any known method, but vanish as soon as he stops thinking of the marked object.
- **Sound Stealing** — Prevents sounds from occurring in real-time by stealing them from marked targets. A stolen footstep is completely silent. Requires conceptualizing the target as a cohesive unit; he can mute an entire person, specific parts like their shoes, an entire firearm, individual bullets, or specific mechanisms within a gun.
- **Sound Playback** — Can reproduce stolen sounds through any marked surface, creating new vibrational energy. Multiple sounds can be played simultaneously. Once a sound is played back, it is consumed and cannot be reproduced again.
- **Sound Library** — Maintains an internal library of stored sounds. Sounds degrade in quality after approximately 24 hours. If he steals incidental noises without being aware they occurred, he typically cannot utilize them.
- **Weaponized Sound** — Loud sounds such as explosions or gunshots can be played back to produce deafening effects or physical damage through sufficient kinetic force.
- **Hearing Aid Integration** — Wears a hearing aid designed by Fury Forge that allows him to steal sounds from the hearing aid's playback rather than from the environment, enabling him to use his powers without silencing the original source.

### Limitations

- **Concentration Dependency** — Effectiveness is directly tied to his concentration. Distractions can cause unintentional release of marked sounds or failure to maintain marks.
- **Cognitive Load** — Maintaining multiple marks and managing his sound library is mentally taxing, especially during extended operations.
- **Environmental Interference** — Noise pollution and chaotic environments can interfere with concentration and control.
- **Memory Requirement** — Can only hold and utilize sounds he is consciously aware of and can keep in memory.
- **Hearing Loss** — Deaf in one ear from a gunshot wound sustained while investigating Operation Ivory. Compensated by Fury Forge's custom hearing aid.

### Training & Skills

- Technical specialist with expertise in evidence analysis and surveillance techniques acquired through work at Chambers & Woo Investigations.
- Trained in grappling and close-quarters combat during his time with the Young Defenders; was observed training Spindle in grappling techniques including the omoplata.
- Proficient in counter-surveillance protocols and investigative methodology.
- Knowledge of encryption and digital security, including understanding of AES-256 encryption limitations.
- Currently completing a college degree.

## Personality

Devonte is laid-back and technically brilliant, functioning as the class clown in most group settings. He is incapable of taking anything seriously for long, frequently cracking jokes and engaging in lewd humor that stays just short of crossing the line. His banter with Akilah Washington has evolved from genuine friction into a comfortable, well-worn dynamic. He has an anti-authoritarian streak and a history of rebelliousness, but pairs it with a consistent interest in justice and fairness. He is a Christian whose faith is sincere enough to have ended a romantic relationship over it.

Beneath the humor, Devonte is perceptive and supportive. He was the one who intervened during the confrontation between Puppeteer and Sam by playing back evidence of Liberty Belle's illness, defusing the situation. He has consistently offered quiet encouragement to Sam during difficult moments. His PERKS interviewing officer noted steady maturation across three consecutive annual assessments, observing that his personality shifted from being a hindrance to being part of his charm as he grew into his role.
