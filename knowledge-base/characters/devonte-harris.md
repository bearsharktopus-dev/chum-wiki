## Background

Devonte Harris was a fifteen-year-old running with a local gang in Philadelphia when Liberty Belle recruited him to the Young Defenders under the codename Playback, insisting he first acquire a JLUMA (juvenile license) and enroll in the PERKS assessment system (2021). Despite being evasive and combative with his interviewing officer, he demonstrated genuine interest in helping his community.

Devonte served through several years of escalating crises, developing from a rebellious teenager into a reliable operative with particular aptitude for stealth and intelligence gathering. He had a pre-powers history with Amira Irshad (Patches), later ringleader of the Philly Phreaks, and a brief relationship with teammate Amelia Li (Gossamer) that ended over his Christian faith and views on premarital sex.

Following the courthouse crisis in 2023, Devonte resigned from the Young Defenders alongside Akilah Washington, adopting the codename Ventriloquist and transitioning into private investigation work at Chambers & Woo Investigations on Diamond Street near Temple University. He was shot and partially deafened during an investigation of Operation Ivory at the docks, and now wears a custom hearing aid designed by Fury Forge.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | F4/E/P/B |
| **Category** | Filch |
| **Power Ranking** | 4/10 |
| **Control** | 6/10 |
| **Hostility** | 4/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 2/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 3/10 |

### Abilities

- **Sound Marking** - Can mentally "mark" objects or individuals, allowing him to steal or play back sounds from those targets. Can theoretically mark a limitless number of objects, but practically limited to around 6 or 7 due to cognitive constraints. Marks are invisible and undetectable by any known method, but vanish as soon as he stops thinking of the marked object.
- **Sound Stealing** - Prevents sounds from occurring in real-time by stealing them from marked targets. A stolen footstep is completely silent. Requires conceptualizing the target as a cohesive unit; he can mute an entire person, specific parts like their shoes, an entire firearm, individual bullets, or specific mechanisms within a gun. Can also steal sounds from the environment at large, including absorbing all crowd noise in a wide area to create total silence, though this causes physical strain including nosebleeds.
- **Sound Playback** - Can reproduce stolen sounds through any marked surface, creating new vibrational energy. Multiple sounds can be played simultaneously. Once a sound is played back, it is consumed and cannot be reproduced again. Demonstrated applications include playing stolen gunshot sounds directly into an opponent's ears for disorientation, reproducing crowd noise as a compressed burst for concussive effect, and generating phantom sounds from marked objects to create diversions.
- **Sound Library** - Maintains an internal library of stored sounds. Sounds degrade in quality after approximately 24 hours. If he steals incidental noises without being aware they occurred, he typically cannot utilize them. He habitually keeps useful sounds such as firecrackers and gunshots stockpiled for tactical use.
- **Weaponized Sound** - Loud sounds such as explosions or gunshots can be played back to produce deafening effects or physical damage through sufficient kinetic force.
- **Hearing Aid Integration** - Wears a hearing aid designed by Fury Forge that allows him to steal sounds from the hearing aid's playback rather than from the environment, enabling him to use his powers without silencing the original source. The hearing aid is fireproof and includes an echolocation mode. He can also record audio by marking the hearing aid itself.

### Limitations

- **Concentration Dependency** - Effectiveness is directly tied to his concentration. Distractions can cause unintentional release of marked sounds or failure to maintain marks.
- **Cognitive Load** - Maintaining multiple marks and managing his sound library is mentally taxing, especially during extended operations.
- **Physical Strain** - Large-scale sound nullification causes nosebleeds and significant physical cost. During the courthouse crisis, he bled heavily from the nose while nullifying sound across a massive area.
- **Environmental Interference** - Noise pollution and chaotic environments can interfere with concentration and control.
- **Memory Requirement** - Can only hold and utilize sounds he is consciously aware of and can keep in memory.
- **Hearing Loss** - Deaf in one ear from a gunshot wound sustained while investigating Operation Ivory. Compensated by Fury Forge's custom hearing aid, with implant surgery scheduled afterward.

### Training & Skills

- Trained in grappling and close-quarters combat; carries escrima batons as primary melee weapons.
- First aid trained (demonstrated treating Miss Mayfly during the Ricochet fight).
- Technical specialist in evidence analysis, counter-surveillance, and digital security (including AES-256 encryption) through work at Chambers & Woo.
- Currently completing a college degree.

## Personality

Devonte is laid-back and irreverent, functioning as the class clown in most group settings. He has a devil-may-care swagger, flirty manner, and constant quippy banter - nicknaming opponents on the fly ("Tigger" for Ricochet, "rock head" for Pumice) and trading insults with teammates as affection. His banter with Akilah has evolved from genuine friction into a comfortable, well-worn dynamic. He has an anti-authoritarian streak paired with a consistent interest in justice and fairness, and is a Christian whose faith is sincere enough to have ended a relationship over it.

Beneath the humor, Devonte is perceptive and supportive, consistently offering quiet encouragement during difficult moments. His PERKS interviewing officer noted steady maturation across three consecutive annual assessments, observing that his personality shifted from being a hindrance to being part of his charm.

## Relationships

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Introduced as a Young Defenders member during Sam's first visit to DVD HQ. Described as a tall Black kid, a year or two older than Sam, with a short dark buzz-cut under a beanie and a surprisingly muscular build. Immediately tries to flirt with Sam (age 14), getting repeatedly disciplined by Puppeteer. His power is described as "sound stuff" - absorbing all sound from his movements for silent running, then releasing stored sound as explosive concussive blasts. On the obstacle course, he sprints the entire thing using exact footfall placement, his movements eerily silent. Participates in team activities and patrols. Coaches Sam on how to lower her voice half an octave for her court testimony against Mudslide.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Found lounging in the locker room with earbuds when Sam arrives at HQ after being ambushed by the Kingdom. Questions Liberty Belle's absence from the team, which draws sharp rebukes from Puppeteer. Intervenes during Puppeteer's violent confrontation with Sam by using his power to replay a secretly recorded audio clip of Liberty Belle vomiting and coughing, revealing that Belle is seriously ill and defusing the situation. Admits he knew because he's "a nosy bitch" who heard things he shouldn't have. Advocates for Sam pressing charges against Puppeteer for the assault, but is overruled. Takes Sam to Wawa afterward to decompress.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Participates in the South Street battle against the Philly Phreaks. During the tactical briefing, he is assigned to audio control and banter/provocation. Reveals a pre-powers history with Patches, who calls him by his civilian name. Patches manipulates Deathgirl against him, telling the girl that Playback "works for those bad people that made your parents leave." Deathgirl copies his sound powers during the fight, manifesting mouths in her palms to produce sonic blasts. Devonte tactically plays dead during the battle while secretly siphoning sound, then releases an explosive roar of stored sound directed at Deathgirl to break her concentration. Watches Patches' interrogation behind a one-way mirror afterward, staying uncharacteristically silent. Later loses a $20 bet to Rampart about Sam and Gale dating. Arrives at the refinery scene after Belle's death at the hands of Chernobyl.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at DVD HQ when Sam returns weeks after Belle's death. Greets her with "It's not the same without our Bloodhound sniffing out trouble." Observed training Spindle in grappling techniques, including the omoplata. At the New Year's Eve party, brings a Super Smash Brothers Melee setup with GameCube controllers and a 3D-printed adapter. Tries to lighten the mood when Sam reveals she was tortured by the Phreaks, joking "So, uh, do you floss all of them?" and "You are a werewolf?"

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Battles Ricochet alongside Crossroads when the supervillain appears in Sam's neighborhood. Uses escrima batons and sound-based powers, tactically poking and prodding Ricochet rather than using full swings after understanding that hard hits feed Ricochet's kinetic absorption. Applies first aid to Miss Mayfly behind crates after she is blasted through them. Silences the click of handcuffs so Moonshot can restrain Ricochet without him noticing. Offers quiet consolation to Sam after Crossroads reprimands her for disobeying orders: "Don't let Crossroads get you down... You showed up. That counts for something." Participates in the team debate about the drug Fly and artificial powers, pushing back against the idea that criminals are "naturally bad seeds" and clashing mainly with Puppeteer before Crossroads shuts the argument down.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Supporting

    During the courthouse protest, argued alongside Sam against NSRA suppression orders, directly confronting Multiplex: "Bullshit... This is about control." When the Phreaks force-fed Jump to protestors, stood on an LRAD truck platform and used massive-scale sound nullification to silence the area and deliver an evacuation message, causing severe nosebleeds. Deathgirl sent Pumice after him specifically. Resigned from the Young Defenders at arc's end, citing college, though Sam detected underlying bitterness; whispered "Keep giving 'em hell, Bee. And keep in touch. Don't trust these bitches" before leaving.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow (Interlude DH.1)"

    **Role:** Main

    POV interlude set during the Phreaks' courthouse attack. Devonte and Spindle engage Pumice in a prolonged street fight. Devonte uses sound manipulation to disorient Pumice - playing a stolen car alarm behind him, blasting compressed crowd noise into his ears, and stealing all of Pumice's sounds to rob him of auditory feedback. Despite these tactics, Pumice proves devastatingly resilient, throwing Spindle into a parked car and slamming Devonte into the pavement. Devonte recovers a riot cop's rubber bullet launcher for Spindle, silencing its report for stealth fire. Gale arrives disguised in biker leathers, and the trio coordinates: Gale launches debris and propels Spindle at highway velocity using a riot shield as a sail. The final takedown comes when Spindle wraps Pumice's face to cut off air while Devonte delivers the knockout baton blow. They secure Pumice with zip ties.

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Returns in Chapter 116 alongside Akilah Washington, arriving at the DVD gym unannounced. Neither is in costume, and their keycards were never deactivated. Wearing a baby-blue backwards baseball cap and a sweater, now doing PI work and attending college. Pulls Sam aside for a private meeting at the Tacony Music Hall with Jordan, Tasha, and Maggie present, insisting on "no Jamal, no adults in the room." Delivers critical intelligence on Project Titan, a classified military black ops program run with the NSRA's full knowledge and cooperation that attempted to create enhanced soldiers through artificial power induction - "none of it worked. Just a lot of cancer." Identifies Patriot as an original test subject and documented war criminal deployed from 2007-2013 in extrajudicial killings, torture of prisoners, and coverups of civilian casualties. Akilah presents physical evidence (dried blood containing Fly traces) proving Egalitarian uses the superpower-granting drug Fly, though Devonte is curiously forceful in dismissing the Jump/Fly connection to Project Titan as "a red herring." This intelligence becomes the leverage Sam uses to confront and negotiate a truce with Patriot.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude)

    Referenced as keeping ears to the ground with Akilah on Kingdom activities. Arrives bleeding at the Music Hall door at the end of Chapter 130 as a cliffhanger. In Interlude DH.2, Devonte investigates Kingdom activities at the docks near 5245 Bleigh Avenue alone (Akilah sat it out over "proper procedure" concerns). Uses sound-stealing to evade guards and overhears plans for "Operation Ivory" - elephant and rhino trafficking to Johannesburg, a mysterious "second phase," and Maya Richardson's role as political cover. Mrs. Heartbeat arrives to check progress. After accidentally giving away his position, Mr. Nothing appears behind him and fires, ripping off a chunk of his upper ear. Akilah arrives to rescue him, yanking goons with her strings while Devonte blasts stolen gunshot sounds at gunmen. Shot in the side during the escape (grazing wound), he loses consciousness at the Music Hall. From his hospital bed (Ch. 131), shares Operation Ivory intelligence with the team. Left ear gone without an implant, right ear compromised. Sam stays overnight; Fury Forge promises implants. His parents are "not on great terms" with him - his father would consider getting shot a "sign of weakness."

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Implant surgery scheduled for the following month. Described as "still adjusting... managing."

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam's parents agree to let her consult with Devonte and Akilah at Chambers & Woo. Devonte now has an afro, a cochlear implant (mostly deaf), and Fury Forge's custom hearing aid (fireproof, echolocation mode, can record audio by marking it). Chambers & Woo analyzes the warehouse USB drives - approximately 200GB of AES-256 encrypted files - and is already tracking Kingdom shell companies (PharmaSyn, NextGen Biologics, Helix Innovations). During the staged Soot fake-death operation, Devonte provides critical remote support: feeding Sam's voice into her ear and triggering a deafening siren distraction when Mr. Polygraph demands an unmasking that wasn't part of the plan.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam enlists Devonte and Akilah at Chambers & Woo Investigations to help decrypt Kingdom files. They confirm Stheno Pharmaceuticals and Tremont & Fairfax connections. Provides counter-surveillance advice and discusses AES-256 encryption.
