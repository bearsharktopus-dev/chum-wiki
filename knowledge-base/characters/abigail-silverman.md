## Background

Abigail Silverman is Sam Small's first cousin, described as the closest thing Sam has to a sister. She is the daughter of Rebecca Silverman (nee Small) and Aaron Silverman. Rebecca is one of Pop-Pop Moe's three children alongside Benjamin Small and Herschel "Shelly" Small, making Abigail Moe's granddaughter. Her brother is Jake Silverman, a teenage drone photographer.

Abigail is a journalist and political activist attending Emerson College in Boston. Sam refers to her as "like my big sister," and Abigail calls Sam "little shark." During the Tashlich ceremony in Book 7 (Ch. 108), she independently deduced Sam's identity as Bloodhound and promised to keep the secret, making her one of the few civilians outside Sam's immediate team who knows.

## Powers & Abilities

Abigail Silverman has no metahuman abilities. She is a trained journalist with sharp investigative reasoning, an active political organizer with direct protest experience, and a skilled debater on theological and political subjects.

## Personality

Abigail is a "force of nature" - politically engaged, intellectually aggressive, and willing to challenge established norms even within her own family. Her activism is not performative; she shows up with protest injuries and claims to be "in the area" when visiting Sam in the hospital, though Sam suspects she traveled specifically to see her.

Despite her forceful exterior, she demonstrates genuine emotional warmth and loyalty. Her promise to protect Sam's secret reflects both personal devotion and a professional understanding of what that information could mean if exposed.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Absent from the Rosh Hashanah dinner at Pop-Pop Moe's house in Ventnor, with her empty chair noted by Sam. The family discusses her at length: her journalism at Emerson College, her anarcho-communist political views, and her piece on the erasure of Jewish heritage in modern media. Uncle Aaron expresses pride in her voice, Uncle Shelly calls her argumentative, and Miriam mentions collaborating with her on an online magazine. Sam reflects that Abigail is like a big sister to her (Ch. 16).

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Minor

    Visits Sam in the hospital for her fifteenth birthday, claiming to be "in the area" (Sam: "No the fuck you were not"). Their embrace is described as "all bear and no teddy." Interacts with Grandma Camilla, asking "Who are you?" when Camilla tries to redirect conversation. Listed among the procession of birthday visitors alongside family, teammates, and friends (Ch. 68).

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Minor

    Attends the Small family Passover Seder at their rebuilt home. Arrives late ("Did I miss the plagues?"), wearing thrift-store chic and clutching dog-eared Moleskine notebooks. Initiates theological debates with Pop-Pop Moe about free will, specifically the question of God hardening Pharaoh's heart. Makes a political comment about "actual Jerusalem" to Sam and Jamila before being shut down by Ben's stare. Calls Sam "little shark" and participates enthusiastically in Seder traditions (Ch. 71).

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Attends Rosh Hashanah dinner at Pop-Pop Moe's house in Ventnor with fading bruises on her face and a cut above her left eyebrow from protest injuries. Argues passionately against Uncle Shelly's calls for increased police presence, citing disproportionate minority targeting and recidivism rates. Describes Daedalus as "a torture chamber disguised as a prison" after Uncle Shelly drunkenly reveals Pop-Pop Moe's involvement in building the facility. Accompanies Sam and Pop-Pop Moe to the pier for the Tashlich ceremony, where Pop-Pop Moe attempts to reveal Sam's secret identity - but Abigail cuts him off, revealing she had already figured out Sam is Bloodhound from circumstantial evidence: Sam's hospitalization coinciding with Fedorov's surrender and Bloodhound's disappearance, matching court sketches, and the house being destroyed by the "Dino-Man of Trenton." Promises to keep the secret, citing journalistic integrity and family loyalty (Ch. 108).

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as being at Emerson College in Boston during the Boston Activation Incident at Boston Commons. Mom (Rachel) panics when she realizes Abigail's proximity to the explosion, and Sam reaches out through HIRC to check on her. Later confirmed safe - she was at the protest on the periphery and returned to her dorm. All Emerson students placed under lockdown (Ch. 197).


## Trivia

- The plot thread tracker classifies Abigail's knowledge of Sam's identity as an open thread (O27), noting that if a civilian family member can independently deduce Sam's identity, others might too.
- Her identity reveal is one of several identity compromises Sam faces in Book 7, alongside Patriot (Ch. 118) and federal agents (Ch. 114).
- She is referred to as "Abigail Small" once (in the Book 7 arc summary table); her surname is Silverman from her father Aaron.
- Her proximity to the Boston Activation Incident creates a geographic connection to Claymore's story in Intermission 15.5, though they have no known direct interaction.
- Sam notes that Abigail started a school newspaper at ten and once stapled strongly worded letters to classroom doors (Ch. 16).
- Miriam Small is collaborating with Abigail on an online magazine combining art, history, and journalism.
