## Background

Abigail Silverman is Sam Small's first cousin, described as the closest thing Sam has to a sister. She is connected to the Small family through Pop-Pop Moe (Morris Small), who lists her as a granddaughter "by marriage, via niece/nephew." Her exact branch of the family tree -- whether she is Uncle Shelley's daughter or connected through another relative -- is not explicitly clarified. She is also referred to once as "Abigail Small" in the Book 7 arc summary, though "Silverman" is her predominant surname across all other sources.

Abigail is a journalist and political activist attending Emerson College in Boston. She is described as a "force of nature" with strong political tendencies and a willingness to challenge family norms. She has artificially straightened hair and appeared at Rosh Hashanah dinner in Book 7 with a bruised face from protest injuries, reflecting her direct involvement in activist causes.

Her most significant narrative contribution occurs during the Rosh Hashanah gathering at Pop-Pop Moe's house in Ventnor (Book 7, Chapter 108), where she independently deduces that Sam is Bloodhound through investigative reasoning during the Tashlich ceremony at the pier. She promises to keep the secret, making her one of the few civilians outside Sam's immediate team who knows her superhero identity.

## Powers & Abilities

Abigail Silverman has no metahuman abilities. Her contributions are based on her investigative journalism skills, political activism, and personal courage.

### Training & Skills

- Trained journalist with sharp investigative reasoning abilities, sufficient to independently piece together Sam's identity as Bloodhound from circumstantial evidence.
- Active political organizer with experience in protest movements, as evidenced by her bruised face from protest injuries.
- Engaged in theological and political debate, capable of challenging family members and navigating heated intellectual discussions.

## Personality

Abigail is described as a "force of nature" -- politically engaged, intellectually aggressive, and willing to challenge established norms even within her own family. She initiates theological debates (such as the question of God hardening Pharaoh's heart as a test of free will versus determinism) and makes political comments that provoke discussion. Her activism is not performative; she shows up with protest injuries and claims to be "in the area" when visiting Sam in the hospital, though Sam suspects she traveled specifically to see her.

Despite her forceful personality, Abigail demonstrates genuine emotional warmth and loyalty. Her relationship with Sam functions as a sibling bond, and her promise to protect Sam's secret after deducing the Bloodhound identity reflects both her personal loyalty and her professional understanding of what that information could mean if exposed.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|

## Arc Appearances

| Book | Role | Key Events |
|------|------|------------|
| Intermission 4.5: Amnion | Minor | Visits Sam in the hospital for her fifteenth birthday, described as "visiting from college" and claiming to be "in the area" (Sam suspects she traveled specifically). Listed among the procession of birthday visitors alongside family, teammates, and friends (Ch. 68). |
| Book 5: Mayfly | Minor | Attends the Small family Passover Seder at their rebuilt home. Initiates theological debates about free will, specifically the question of God hardening Pharaoh's heart. Makes political comments about Jerusalem. Engages in political discussions with Benjamin Small (Ch. 71). |
| Book 7: Security | Supporting | Attends Rosh Hashanah dinner at Pop-Pop Moe's house in Ventnor with a bruised face from protest injuries. Is shocked alongside Sam and Jake when Uncle Shelley drunkenly reveals that Pop-Pop Moe's firm helped build the Daedalus Correctional Facility. Accompanies Sam and Pop-Pop Moe to the pier for the Tashlich ceremony, during which she deduces Sam's identity as Bloodhound through investigative journalism reasoning and promises to keep the secret (Ch. 108). |
| Book 13: Burn After Reading | Mentioned | Referenced as being at Emerson College in Boston near the explosion site during the Boston Activation Incident (the event later identified as Claymore's involuntary activation at Boston Commons). Confirmed safe under lockdown (Ch. 197). |

## Trivia

- The plot thread tracker classifies Abigail's knowledge of Sam's identity as an open thread (O27): "Another identity-knowledge leverage point." The thread analysis notes that if a civilian family member can independently deduce Sam's identity, others might too.
- Her identity deduction during the Tashlich ceremony is one of several identity compromises Sam faces in Book 7, alongside Patriot discovering it when Sam's helmet breaks (Ch. 118) and federal agents having her file on record from congressional testimony (Ch. 114).
- She is referred to as "Abigail Small" once (in the Book 7 arc summary character table) and "Abigail Silverman" everywhere else. The discrepancy likely reflects uncertainty about whether "Small" is her birth surname or "Silverman" comes from another parent.
- Her proximity to the Boston Activation Incident while attending Emerson College creates a geographic connection to Claymore's story in Intermission 15.5: This Side Up, though the two characters have no known direct interaction.
- Her artificially straightened hair is noted during the Passover Seder in Book 5.
