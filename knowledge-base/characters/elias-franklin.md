## Background

Elias Franklin was a biochemistry PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, with an undergraduate background in molecular biology. His academic career collapsed under compounding medical bills and student loans after he became wheelchair-bound, and repeated insurance denials - for a new wheelchair and even diapers - radicalized him against the healthcare system and institutional structures governing metahuman abilities.

After a physical therapy session, Sparkplug (a Rogue Wave distributor) approached him, demonstrated superpowers, and provided him with Fly. Elias gained the ability to transform body parts into animal components - a chimeric power set that earned him his villain name - and uses Fly for mobility and Jump for regeneration, operating far beyond his baseline physical limitations.

Elias joined the Philly Phreaks and attacked the Independence Blue Cross building in revenge for his denied claims (Arc 5), then participated in the Phreaks' courthouse attack during the Chernobyl trial (Arc 6). He was the only Phreak to evade capture, prompting a multi-state manhunt. He later resurfaced as a Rogue Wave recruit, hired by Snake Oil as a scientific assistant for Jump and Fly formulation improvements.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Chimeric Transformation** - Transforms individual body parts into those of different animals simultaneously. Documented components include bear arms/claws, armadillo scutes, alligator tail, fox muzzle, gorilla arms, snake tailbone, snow leopard limbs, and vulture wings. Each grants the physical attributes of the corresponding animal.
- **Full-Body Transformation** - Can transform entirely into a single animal (deer, large quadruped rideable by another person). Shifts between forms rapidly, including mid-fall.
- **Fly-Enhanced Mobility** - Animal transformations provide flight (vulture wings), powerful leaping (deer/snow leopard), and raw strength (bear arms), overcoming his wheelchair-bound baseline.
- **Jump-Based Regeneration** - Uses Jump for temporary regenerative abilities, compensating for baseline physical vulnerability.
- **Overwhelming Physical Strength** - In transformed states, overpowered both Sam Small and Derek Taylor simultaneously at the IBC building.

### Limitations

- Wheelchair user in baseline form; requires Fly for mobility.
- Powers are drug-dependent, not innate - reliant on Rogue Wave's supply of both Fly (transformations) and Jump (regeneration).
- Fly users have orange-tinged, "fizzy" blood detectable by Sam's blood-sensing abilities, making him trackable.
- Duration limits of combat transformations are not documented, though he maintained chimeric form through extended confrontations.

### Training & Skills

- Molecular biology undergraduate degree and advanced (incomplete) PhD-level biochemistry from the University of Pennsylvania.
- Applies scientific methodology to field-testing Jump formulations, including data collection and analysis of drug variants.
- Practical lab management, as demonstrated by his makeshift South Philadelphia research station.
- Completed Rogue Wave's physically demanding recruitment scavenger hunt from a wheelchair, impressing Monkey Business.

## Personality

Elias is intellectually brilliant but deeply embittered by the healthcare system's treatment of disabled individuals. He frames his criminal activities through a coherent philosophical framework, insisting his violence is a rational response to systemic injustice rather than drug-induced mania. He believes the Genesis Births should have been the greatest paradigm shift in human history but instead produced oppressive enforcement of the status quo.

His ideology centers on democratizing superpowers - he views Rogue Wave's drug distribution as radical equality, rejecting government control over abilities. This conviction drives his scientific work: he actively refines formulations to make them safer and more effective. Pragmatism operates alongside ideology; Rogue Wave promised him a lifetime Fly supply in exchange for his expertise. Despite his willingness to threaten violence, he showed reluctance to actually kill when Derek threatened suicide at the IBC building, suggesting his bitterness has not entirely displaced his capacity for connection.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Derek Taylor (Fenrir/Bloodhound II) | Former friend | Possible romantic dimension. Derek intervened at the IBC attack, spent months searching for Elias, then provided Sam a blood sample for tracking. By Arc 14, Derek reluctantly let Sam use his phone to contact Elias. |
| Felix Ortega (Snake Oil) | Employer / Mentor | Recruited Elias as his scientific assistant for Jump and Fly formulation work. |
| Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business) | Organization leader | Interviewed and approved Elias for Rogue Wave membership. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Antagonist / Recurring opponent | Confronted him at the IBC building, tracked him through South Philadelphia, and later contacted him via Derek's phone. |
| Sparkplug | Recruiter | Approached Elias after physical therapy and provided him with Fly. |
| Deathgirl (Daisy Zhen) | Former teammate | Fellow Philly Phreak. |
| Pumice (Joseph Jones) | Former teammate | Fellow Philly Phreak; escaped LOVE Park on Elias's back in monstrous form. |
| Rush Order (Dean Carver) | Colleague | Elias tended to Rush Order's injuries at the Camden safehouse. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First mentioned in Chapter 74 when Derek reveals his friend has taken Fly and plans criminal activity. Physically appears in Chapter 75 at the Independence Blue Cross building in Center City, where he has been destroying offices in revenge against the insurance company that denied his claims. Confronted by Sam and Derek on the seventh floor; demonstrates chimeric transformation with bear arms, armadillo scutes, alligator tail, fox muzzle, and bear legs. Overpowers both Sam and Derek in combat. Reveals that a bald man with electrical powers provided him with Fly after physical therapy. Escapes by transforming into a deer and leaping through a seventh-story window. His escape and the information he provides about Fly's source launch the broader investigation into Jump and Fly distribution, leading Sam's team to identify Sparkplug as the distributor.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Reappears in Chapter 90 in a quadruped animal form at Love Park, where Pumice mounts him and rides away to escape the battle. Sam recognizes the creature as Elias. In Chapter 91, Sam briefs the Delaware Valley Defenders on Elias and his connection to the Phreaks, theorizing they are distributing tainted Jump. Participates in the Phreaks' courthouse attack during the Chernobyl trial (Chapter 97), where the group force-feeds tainted Jump to protesters outside the courthouse, causing violent mutations and mass panic. During the battle, he is described with gorilla arms, bear paws, and a snake tailbone, tearing into riot squads. Three Phreaks are apprehended, but Elias escapes. A news broadcast reports a manhunt for the missing Chimera (Ch. 99).

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    A mayoral press release (Interstice EF.1) identifies him as the suspected mastermind of the Phreaks' assault and confirms a multi-state manhunt.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam asks the Auditors if anyone has seen Chimera since the courthouse attack; she theorizes he may have been recruited by the Kingdom.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in the backdrop of the expanding three-way conflict as Rogue Wave emerges as a major threat.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Derek reveals he has been searching for Elias for weeks with no luck, speculating Elias may be dead or have left Philadelphia.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appears in Interlude LS.2 as the final Rogue Wave recruitment candidate, interviewed by Monkey Business and Snake Oil at a Toyota dealership back office. Arrives in a wheelchair - dark skin, natural afro, wire-rimmed glasses. The interview ends on a cliffhanger when he mentions the Philly Phreaks. In Ch. 186, Derek texts Sam that Elias visited his apartment and that he obtained a blood sample via pocket knife. Sam tracks Elias's orange Fly-altered blood through Point Breeze to a warehouse near South Street (Ch. 187), discovering his observation post with a laptop, notebooks, and Jump distribution maps. Elias claims he is testing formulations to make safer drugs, then escapes in chimeric form (snow leopard legs, vulture wings) across rooftops. Later seen at the Camden safehouse tending to Rush Order's injuries (Interlude RS/DC/JF).

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Derek agrees to impersonate Bloodhound partly because he owes Sam for Ben Small getting shot during the Elias/Rush Order situation (Ch. 202).

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam proposes contacting Rogue Wave through Derek's connection to Elias to secure protection from Shrike (Ch. 204). Sam composes a voicemail to Elias on Derek's phone - his contact photo shows a grinning kid with a puffed-up afro giving a thumbs-up, and his voicemail voice sounds deeper and more mature (Ch. 205). This leads to the Tacony Music Hall negotiation; Monkey Business relays that Elias was moved by Derek's message.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the Camden safehouse during Rogue Wave's power extraction of Mr. Polygraph (Interlude DC.2). Wearing a domino mask and birthday hat, with a medical kit in his lap, he preps a novocaine syringe and tells Polygraph with surprising gentleness that he will "still be you, just normal, like most people." Catches the extracted power crystal out of the air and hands Snake Oil gauze afterward.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** N/A

    No documented appearances.


## Trivia

- His villain name "Chimera" is one of the few in the story that directly describes the power set - the mythological creature composed of parts from multiple animals.
- The mayoral press release (Interstice EF.1) is one of the few in-universe government documents to use a character's full legal name rather than alias.
- His Rogue Wave recruitment interview ends on a deliberate narrative cliffhanger when he mentions the Philly Phreaks.
