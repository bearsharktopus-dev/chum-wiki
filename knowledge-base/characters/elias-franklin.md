## Background

Elias Franklin was a PhD-level biochemistry student at the University of Pennsylvania whose academic career collapsed under the weight of compounding medical bills and student loans. A wheelchair user who required ongoing medical treatment, Elias was repeatedly denied insurance claims for basic needs, an experience that radicalized him against the healthcare system and the broader institutional structures governing metahuman abilities in America. Bankrupt and unable to continue his studies, he left UPenn and fell out of mainstream society.

Elias was approached after a physical therapy session by a bald white man with electrical powers - later identified as Sparkplug, a distributor for the criminal organization Rogue Wave - who promised to "fix" his disability. The man demonstrated superpowers to convince Elias and provided him with Fly, the semi-permanent power-granting injectable drug. Elias gained the ability to transform parts of his body into different animal components, a chimeric power set that earned him his villain name. He uses Fly for mobility enhancement and Jump for regeneration, allowing him to operate far beyond the physical limitations imposed by his disability.

Following his empowerment, Elias joined the Philly Phreaks, a group of disaffected young metahumans. His first major criminal act was an attack on the Independence Blue Cross building in Center City Philadelphia in late April 2024, motivated by revenge against the insurance company that had denied his claims. His former friend Derek Taylor, a werewolf vigilante, enlisted Sam Small to help stop him. After a violent confrontation on the seventh floor of the IBC building, Elias escaped by transforming into a deer and leaping through a seventh-story window. He subsequently participated in the Phreaks' courthouse attack during the Chernobyl trial, distributing tainted Jump to protesters and causing mass chaos. Three of the four Phreaks were apprehended, but Elias remained at large, prompting a multi-state manhunt.

Following the Phreaks' dissolution, Elias resurfaced as a recruit for Rogue Wave. He was formally interviewed by Monkey Business and Snake Oil at a Toyota dealership back office, where his PhD-level biochemistry background, experience with Fly, and former Phreaks membership distinguished him from other candidates. He was recruited by Snake Oil as his scientific assistant, providing expertise on Jump and Fly formulation improvements. By the summer of 2025, Elias was conducting field research during Rogue Wave's citywide Jump distribution events, testing different formulations and gathering scientific data from a makeshift research station in a South Philadelphia storage facility.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Chimeric Transformation** - Can transform individual body parts into those of different animals simultaneously, creating a hybrid form. Documented animal components include bear arms and legs with claws, armadillo scutes on chest and back, an alligator tail, a fox muzzle replacing his face, yellow bulging eyes, snow leopard limbs, vulture wings, and deer form. Each transformation grants the physical attributes of the corresponding animal.
- **Full-Body Transformation** - Capable of transforming his entire body into a single animal form, such as a complete deer. Can shift between forms rapidly, including mid-fall to survive otherwise lethal drops.
- **Fly-Enhanced Mobility** - Uses Fly to overcome his wheelchair-bound condition, with animal transformations providing enhanced locomotion including flight (vulture wings), powerful leaping (deer and snow leopard forms), and raw strength (bear arms).
- **Jump-Based Regeneration** - Regularly uses Jump to access temporary regenerative abilities, compensating for his baseline physical vulnerability.
- **Overwhelming Physical Strength** - In transformed states, possesses strength sufficient to overpower multiple combatants simultaneously. During the IBC building confrontation, he overpowered both Sam Small and Derek Taylor in direct combat.

### Limitations

- Elias is a wheelchair user in his baseline human form, requiring Fly to achieve mobility through animal transformations.
- His powers are drug-dependent rather than innate; he requires ongoing access to both Fly (for his transformation abilities) and Jump (for regeneration), making him reliant on Rogue Wave's supply chain.
- Fly users exhibit distinctive physiological markers including orange-tinged blood and a "fizzy" quality detectable by Sam Small's blood-sensing abilities, making him trackable.
- The specific duration and sustainability of his transformations under combat conditions are not documented, though he was able to maintain chimeric form throughout extended confrontations.

### Training & Skills

- PhD-level biochemistry education from the University of Pennsylvania (incomplete but at an advanced stage), providing deep expertise in pharmacology and drug formulation.
- Scientific methodology skills applied to field-testing Jump formulations, including data collection, documentation, and analysis of different drug variants.
- Practical laboratory and research station management, as demonstrated by his makeshift facility in the South Philadelphia storage building.
- Sufficient physical resourcefulness to complete Rogue Wave's recruitment scavenger hunt from a wheelchair, impressing Monkey Business who questioned how he managed the physical challenges.

## Personality

Elias is intellectually brilliant but deeply embittered by his experiences with the American healthcare system and its treatment of disabled individuals. He combines academic precision with revolutionary zeal, articulating his criminal activities through a coherent philosophical framework. During his confrontation with Sam at the IBC building, he rejected the suggestion that Fly had altered his thinking, insisting he was "lucid" and "aware" - framing his violence as a rational response to systemic injustice rather than drug-induced mania. He believes that the Genesis Births should have been the greatest paradigm shift in human history, but instead produced a system he characterizes as oppressive enforcement of the status quo.

His ideology centers on the democratization of superpowers. He views Rogue Wave's distribution of Jump and Fly as a form of radical equality, rejecting the premise that abilities should be controlled by government agencies or determined by the genetic lottery of natural metahuman activation. This conviction drives his scientific work: he does not merely distribute drugs but actively works to refine them, seeking to create safer and more effective formulations. When confronted by Sam during the July 2025 Jump distribution event, he justified his actions by claiming Rogue Wave had promised him a lifetime supply of Fly for his condition in exchange for his expertise - pragmatism and ideology operating in tandem. Despite his willingness to threaten violence, he demonstrated reluctance to actually kill when Derek threatened suicide during their IBC confrontation, suggesting that his bitterness has not entirely displaced his capacity for connection.

## Trivia

- Elias is one of the few characters in the story whose villain name directly describes his power set - "Chimera" referring to the mythological creature composed of parts from multiple animals.
- The mayoral press release following the courthouse attack (Interstice EF.1) is one of the few in-universe government documents to use a character's full legal name, identifying him as "Elias Franklin" rather than his alias.
- His recruitment interview with Rogue Wave ends on a deliberate cliffhanger when he reveals his Philly Phreaks connection, a narrative device that delays the reader's understanding of how and why he transitioned between criminal organizations.
- Elias's blood has a distinctive orange tint and "fizzy" quality common to Fly users, a detail that allows Sam to track him but also marks him as a drug user to anyone with similar sensory abilities.
- His ability to complete Rogue Wave's physically demanding recruitment scavenger hunt from a wheelchair impressed Monkey Business, who questioned how he managed the challenges - a detail that underscores Elias's resourcefulness and the effectiveness of his Fly-enhanced transformations.
- The character reference guide notes Derek Taylor's relationship with Elias as that of a "friend (and possible romantic interest)," suggesting a deeper personal dimension to Derek's ongoing pursuit.
- Elias's current investigation into Vysera positions him as one of the few characters actively working to uncover the connection between the Kingdom's drug operations and Rogue Wave's research - an investigation whose outcome could significantly shift the balance of power between the two organizations.
