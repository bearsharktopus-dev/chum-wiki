## Background

Evan Thomas Williams was born in Camden, New Jersey, the son of Elise Williams (nee Johnson), a school teacher, and Peter Williams, a former steelworker. He attended Camden High School but dropped out during his senior year in 2007 without obtaining a GED. Over the following decade, he cycled through a series of blue-collar jobs: construction worker at Dynamic Constructions (2007-2010), sanitation worker with the Camden City Sanitation Department (2010-2013), factory worker at Camden Metal Works (2013-2015), and demolition specialist at Urban Renewal Demolition Services (2015-2018). An undisclosed HR incident in 2018 forced him off the books, after which he worked under the table for Urban Renewal, took odd jobs around his neighborhood, and worked as a bouncer at local bars.

Evan's metahuman abilities manifested at an unknown point, and his first known use of them was during an attempted robbery of a Walgreens in August 2023. He was apprehended by Sam Small (Bloodhound) and Gale (Jamila Fayad) during their first patrol together, making him Sam's first arrest. He was subsequently incarcerated pending trial. While in custody, he was connected with Mr. Bomb, a Kingdom of Keys operative who operates as a lawyer, and was recruited into the organization. The Kingdom identified his liquefaction powers as ideal for heisting, infiltration, and enforcement work. Since his recruitment, Evan has undergone significant development from a petty criminal into a genuinely threatening supervillain, rising to fill the Mr. M position within the Kingdom's alphabetical hierarchy.

The Professional Asset Dossier compiled on Evan by Kingdom operatives Mr. E and Mr. C assessed him as a prime candidate for recruitment, noting that his socioeconomic background, sense of unfulfillment, and need for belonging made him highly receptive to the organization's overtures. The dossier recommended financial incentives coupled with a purposeful role as effective motivators. This assessment proved accurate: the Kingdom became the first group in Evan's life that genuinely believed in him and found him useful.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Surface Liquefaction** - Evan can transmute any solid, contiguous, non-living surface he is touching into thick, wet sludge approximately the consistency of mud. This power is activated through physical contact, typically via his feet, though it can emanate from any point of contact on his body. Activation requires specific hand gestures, mental concentration, physical exertion, and contact with a surface contiguous with the target material. The ability functions through clothing such as shoes and gloves.
- **Terrain Manipulation** - Uses liquefaction to burrow through walls, carve tunnels underground, trap opponents by sinking them into floors, and create escape routes through solid structures. Can form J-shaped tunnels to prevent flooding during underground infiltration.
- **Projectile Generation** - Can liquefy solid objects such as bricks, then throw them; the material re-solidifies upon losing contact with his hands, creating extremely dangerous high-velocity projectiles.
- **Burial** - Capable of completely submerging objects and people underground by liquefying the ground beneath them. Has demonstrated the ability to bury a person thirty feet underground.

### Limitations

- **Direct Contact Requirement** - Must be in physical contact with the material he wishes to liquefy, limiting the range of his powers to his immediate environment. The contact must be with a surface contiguous with the desired target surface.
- **Exclusion of Living Matter** - Powers do not extend to living organisms.
- **Exclusion of Pre-Liquefied Materials** - Powers do not affect materials already in a liquid or semi-liquid state, such as mud, water, blood, or silt.
- **Ineffectiveness on Loose Surfaces** - Powers are ineffective on particularly loose surfaces like sand or dusty dirt, suggesting a threshold of material cohesion is necessary.
- **Ejection Effect** - Current observations indicate an involuntary ejection effect on individuals who are not completely submerged in the liquefied material, which may prevent burying someone alive unless full submersion is achieved quickly.
- **Conductive Material Vulnerability** - During the Daedalus operation, an anti-phase/intangibility lattice security system severely electrocuted Evan through conductive titanium ore while he was tunneling, indicating that his liquefaction process does not insulate him from electrical conductivity in the material.

### Training & Skills

- Extensive demolition expertise from years of professional work, including understanding of structural weak points and efficient deconstruction techniques.
- Skilled urban explorer with experience navigating abandoned buildings and complex urban environments.
- Proficient in mechanical engineering, particularly rapid assembly and disassembly of vehicles and industrial components. Maintains a motorcycle in his spare time.
- Significantly above-average upper body strength for his weight class despite moderate obesity, developed through years of physically demanding labor.
- Exceptional night vision, possibly a side effect of his activation, accompanied by mild light sensitivity to bright lights and direct sunlight.
- Competent in physical altercations, with experience as a bar bouncer.
- Participates in local demolition derbies, indicating physical agility and robustness.

## Personality

Evan is quiet, contemplative, and introverted, preferring solitary activities like urban exploration and mechanical work. He is not socially anxious or lonely by nature but rather a genuine introvert with thrill-seeking tendencies. He relishes his power and can be a bully, enjoying the authority and capability his abilities grant him. He tends to talk when nervous but is silent and focused when in his element. He carries a pronounced inferiority complex rooted in his socioeconomic background and history of unstable employment, which manifests as an intense hatred of wealthy people. He has a history of mood swings and an addiction-prone personality, with frequent purchases of lottery tickets and cigarettes and visits to local casinos.

Evan harbors deep-seated resentment toward authority figures, likely stemming from negative experiences with law enforcement and the justice system. He is less boisterous and less prone to fits of anger than his frequent partner Mr. Tyrannosaur, having made efforts to get a grip on his temper over time. His signature uniform always includes a brown paper bag with holes cut out over his head, which serves both as an identity concealment and as a deliberate symbol of his blue-collar labor upbringing. He takes this symbolism seriously, even as his Kingdom colleagues mock it.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Transferred from Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center. The Kingdom launches a highway ambush on the Pennsylvania Turnpike to liberate him and Mr. Nothing, successfully freeing both operatives. In Interlude BM.2, the team retreats in a disguised plumbing van ("Ace Flow Solutions") to a Kingdom-owned steakhouse in Lancaster. During the van ride and subsequent meal, the team mocks Evan's paper bag mask, prompting him to explain its symbolic meaning -- it represents his blue-collar labor upbringing and working-class identity. The discussion reveals team dynamics and Kingdom infrastructure, including the steakhouse's role as a money laundering front. Evan remains notably quieter than his colleagues throughout the interactions (per Mr. Nothing, who is even more silent).

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced during Kingdom operations planning.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude)

    Narrates Interlude EW.1, the Daedalus Correctional Facility extraction of Deathgirl. Wears unusual combat gear instead of Kingdom's standard suits, signaling this operation differs from normal protocol. Leads a four-person extraction team (Mudslide, Vector, Tarbaby, Mrs. Synapse) while a separate B-Team creates diversions at the main facility. Creates a J-shaped tunnel beneath Daedalus to prevent flooding, but is severely electrocuted by an anti-phase/intangibility lattice security system through conductive titanium ore. After Mrs. Synapse treats his burns, the team breaches utility corridors behind Cell Block D and reaches Deathgirl's cell (D-7). Mrs. Synapse sedates the sleeping Deathgirl with an aerosol compound, and Evan insists on bringing her personal belongings (penguin plushie, books, photos) to keep her calm -- a display of practical empathy. Vector transports the sedated girl via telekinesis, but Deathgirl wakes prematurely because she is more well-fed than the team expected (they had anticipated malnourishment and neglect, but her cell showed signs of rehabilitation). She copies Vector's telekinesis, then Synapse's nerve manipulation, then Evan's liquefaction in rapid succession -- all without physical contact, revealing her power-copying is more advanced than intelligence suggested. The tunnel floor dissolves completely when she copies Evan's power, and she escapes into lower tunnels. Tarbaby reveals a tracking device was planted on Deathgirl as a pre-planned contingency that was deliberately not shared with Kingdom operatives. The team extracts via helicopter, with Red Calf treating Deathgirl's physical capture as secondary to removing her from government custody.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in Kingdom discussions and planning.


## Trivia

- Evan was Sam Small's very first arrest as a superhero, making their rivalry personally significant for both characters.
- His Kingdom designation is Mr. M, fitting into the organization's alphabetical naming convention.
- The Professional Asset Dossier compiled on him was authored by Mr. E and Mr. C and includes an explosive tracker that detonates if the document is moved into unauthorized locations.
- His dossier was prepared through the law office of Mrs. Ashley Thompson at Thompson & Sons, P.C., a Kingdom-affiliated firm.
- During the Daedalus operation, Tarbaby provided him with an upgraded carbon-fiber version of his signature paper bag mask.
- He has a minimal online footprint, limited to occasional posts on urban exploration forums under various pseudonyms.
- His brief 2019 jail term was for involvement in a bar fight over an unpaid debt.
- The character reference guide identifies him as one of Sam's narrative foils, though he has no idea what a narrative foil is.
- During the Daedalus extraction, he insisted on bringing Deathgirl's personal belongings, including a penguin plushie, books, and photos, showing a degree of practical empathy unusual for a Kingdom enforcer.
- The Daedalus operation revealed a significant tension between Kingdom and Red Calf operatives: Tarbaby's pre-planted tracking device on Deathgirl was a contingency deliberately withheld from the Kingdom team, suggesting Red Calf did not fully trust their partners.
- Evan's narration of the Daedalus extraction reveals his competence under pressure -- despite being severely electrocuted by the security lattice, he continued tunneling and led the team to the target cell.
- The operation was deliberately timed to coincide with Boston protests and state senate hearings, maximizing political distraction.
- Deathgirl's cell at Daedalus contained personal items (books, photos, stuffed animals) suggesting she was receiving some degree of rehabilitation rather than pure imprisonment, which contradicted the extraction team's expectations of finding a malnourished, neglected prisoner.
