## Background

Evan Thomas Williams was born in Camden, New Jersey, the son of Elise Williams (nee Johnson), a school teacher, and Peter Williams, a former steelworker. He attended Camden High School but dropped out during his senior year in 2007 without obtaining a GED. Over the following decade, he cycled through blue-collar jobs: construction worker at Dynamic Constructions (2007-2010), sanitation worker with Camden City Sanitation (2010-2013), factory worker at Camden Metal Works (2013-2015), and demolition specialist at Urban Renewal Demolition Services (2015-2018). An undisclosed HR incident in 2018 forced him off the books, after which he worked under the table, took odd jobs, and bounced at local bars. He also served a brief jail term in 2019 for a bar fight over an unpaid debt.

Evan's first known use of his metahuman abilities was an attempted Walgreens robbery in August 2023 - Sam Small's first arrest. While incarcerated, Mr. Bomb recruited him into the Kingdom of Keys, which identified his liquefaction powers as ideal for heisting, infiltration, and enforcement. A Professional Asset Dossier compiled by Mr. E and Mr. C (prepared through the law office of Mrs. Ashley Thompson at Thompson & Sons, P.C.) assessed his socioeconomic background, unfulfillment, and need for belonging as making him highly receptive; the dossier includes an explosive tracker that detonates if moved to unauthorized locations. The Kingdom became the first group in Evan's life that genuinely believed in him, and he has since risen from petty criminal to the Mr. M position within the organization's alphabetical hierarchy.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Surface Liquefaction** - Transmutes any solid, contiguous, non-living surface he touches into thick sludge approximately the consistency of mud. Activation requires specific hand gestures, mental concentration, physical exertion, and contact with a surface contiguous with the target material. Functions through clothing such as shoes and gloves.
- **Terrain Manipulation** - Burrows through walls, carves tunnels underground, traps opponents by sinking them into floors, and creates escape routes through solid structures. Can form J-shaped tunnels to prevent flooding.
- **Projectile Generation** - Liquefies solid objects (e.g., bricks), then throws them; the material re-solidifies upon losing contact with his hands, creating high-velocity shrapnel.
- **Burial** - Completely submerges objects and people underground by liquefying the ground beneath them. Has buried a person thirty feet deep.

### Limitations

- **Direct Contact Requirement** - Must touch a surface contiguous with the target material; range is limited to his immediate environment.
- **Exclusion of Living Matter** - Powers do not affect living organisms.
- **Exclusion of Pre-Liquefied Materials** - Ineffective on materials already liquid or semi-liquid (mud, water, blood, silt).
- **Ineffectiveness on Loose Surfaces** - Fails on sand, dusty dirt, and similarly unconsolidated materials, suggesting a cohesion threshold.
- **Ejection Effect** - Incompletely submerged individuals are involuntarily ejected, making live burial difficult without rapid full submersion.
- **Conductive Material Vulnerability** - Liquefaction does not insulate him from electrical conductivity; the Daedalus anti-phase lattice severely electrocuted him through conductive titanium ore while tunneling.

### Training & Skills

- Extensive demolition expertise, including structural weak points and efficient deconstruction techniques.
- Skilled urban explorer; navigates abandoned buildings and complex urban environments.
- Proficient in mechanical engineering - rapid assembly/disassembly of vehicles and industrial components. Maintains a motorcycle.
- Above-average upper body strength despite moderate obesity, from years of physical labor. Competent fighter with bouncer experience.
- Exceptional night vision (possibly activation-related), with mild light sensitivity.
- Participates in local demolition derbies.

## Personality

Evan is quiet, contemplative, and genuinely introverted - preferring solitary activities like urban exploration and mechanical work - but with thrill-seeking tendencies. He relishes his power and can be a bully. He talks when nervous but is silent and focused when in his element. A pronounced inferiority complex rooted in his socioeconomic background manifests as intense hatred of wealthy people. He has a history of mood swings and an addiction-prone personality (lottery tickets, cigarettes, casinos).

He harbors deep-seated resentment toward authority figures. Less boisterous and less anger-prone than his frequent partner Mr. Tyrannosaur, he has worked to control his temper over time. His signature brown paper bag mask serves as both identity concealment and a deliberate symbol of blue-collar labor - he takes this symbolism seriously, even as colleagues mock it.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Robs a Walgreens and is apprehended by Sam and Gale during their first patrol (Ch. 7). Sam later testifies against him in court (Ch. 9). Subsequently recruited by the Kingdom of Keys; witnessed by Sam and Jordan murdering a captive at the Dobson Textile Factory as a loyalty test (Ch. 12). Fights Sam and Jordan in a brutal confrontation alongside Mr. Nothing and Mr. Polygraph; retreats when police sirens approach (Ch. 13).

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Drone footage of the Dobson Factory murder is presented to the Delaware Valley Defenders (Ch. 15), identifying Mudslide as a Kingdom operative.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appears with an upgraded look - tan button-down, black tie, slacks, and a professionally cut paper bag mask - marking his rise in the Kingdom hierarchy. Confronts Sam's team during their escape from a Kingdom warehouse on Trenton Avenue on Halloween night (Ch. 41), liquefying the ground beneath them. Spindle voluntarily stays behind to fight him as a diversion while the rest of the team escapes. Mudslide uses brick shrapnel projectiles against Spindle, who fights back with mace spray.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Ambushes the Auditors alongside Mr. ESP in the abandoned Arch Street Subway tunnels beneath Philadelphia during their pursuit of Chernobyl (Ch. 59). Carries a sack of bricks as weapons, disintegrating them mid-throw into clouds of jagged shrapnel. Traps Sam and Jordan's feet in liquefied concrete. Jordan and Spindle fight him directly while Sam engages Mr. ESP. When Chernobyl arrives and violently rejects the Kingdom's recruitment attempt, he abandons the fight to tend to the injured Mr. ESP and they tunnel away through the concrete (Ch. 60).

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Interlude (MR.1)

    Present at a Kingdom safehouse at 12th and Pine, greeting Maya Richardson with a bottle of Hennessy on Mr. Nothing's instructions. Participates in a phone debriefing with Mr. Nothing about the Rogue Wave mind-control threat and the upcoming Chernobyl trial. Part of the strategic discussion about Kingdom positioning during the trial chaos and Maya's proposal to offer their services to the NSRA. Evan suggests exploiting the chaos to expand turf, which Maya shuts down, though his instinct about opportunity in chaos sparks her more refined NSRA infiltration idea.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Confronts Sam at the Crescent nightclub during her undercover operation (Ch. 123-124), recognizing her despite her disguise and pulling a gun on her. Sam fights back with mace, hand-teeth, and a civilian taser; his gun goes off during the struggle, tearing a deep furrow through her upper arm. Chases her through the club's back hallways, phasing through walls, before she escapes into the crowd. Later participates in the Kingdom's zoo operation, liquefying glass barriers in the Reptile House to steal poison dart frogs alongside Mr. Nothing and Mrs. Heartbeat (Ch. 134). Stays to fight when the Auditors intervene, shouting that he won't give up on "the only people I have left." Shoots Flashpoint (Maggie O'Brien) three times in the chest, but she survives thanks to a bulletproof vest. An enraged Maggie nearly crushes his skull with her repulsion fields before Sam stops her (Ch. 135). Arrested alongside Mr. Nothing at the conclusion of the battle.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam identifies Mudslide as her nemesis "by sheer volume" during a conversation about rivals, with Jordan dismissing him as "an embarrassment" (Ch. 140). Mrs. Xenograft references his capture at the zoo during a debrief with Mr. Antithesis (Interlude LTN.2).

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Transferred from Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center. The Kingdom launches a highway ambush on I-78 near Allentown to liberate him and Mr. Nothing, incapacitating Captain Plasma and destroying the convoy. In Interlude BM.2, the extraction team retreats in a disguised plumbing van ("Ace Flow Solutions") to a Kingdom-owned steakhouse in Lancaster. During the van ride and subsequent meal, the team mocks Evan's paper bag mask, prompting him to explain its symbolic meaning - it represents people like them who "scrape by," a statement that he's "just a guy" but still here. Mrs. Laceration compliments him, saying he's "too pretty to hide" his face, calling it a "mafioso face." The discussion reveals team dynamics and Kingdom infrastructure, including the steakhouse's role as a money laundering front. Evan orders the cheapest steak on the menu.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in passing - Sam mentions Tremont & Fairfax defending "everyone from Mudslide to Aaron McKinley" while confronting a Kingdom-linked lawyer (Ch. 174).

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude)

    Narrates Interlude EW.1, the Daedalus Correctional Facility extraction of Deathgirl. Wears unusual combat gear instead of Kingdom's standard suits, signaling this operation differs from normal protocol. Leads a four-person extraction team (Mudslide, Vector, Tarbaby, Mrs. Synapse) while a separate B-Team creates diversions at the main facility. Creates a J-shaped tunnel beneath Daedalus to prevent flooding, but is severely electrocuted by an anti-phase/intangibility lattice security system through conductive titanium ore. After Mrs. Synapse treats his burns, the team breaches utility corridors behind D-Block and reaches Deathgirl's cell (Cell 17 in Block D-7). Mrs. Synapse sedates the sleeping Deathgirl with an aerosol compound, and Evan insists on bringing her personal belongings (her penguin plushie "Mr. Waddles," books, photos, journal, and blanket) to keep her calm - a display of practical empathy. Vector transports the sedated girl via telekinesis, but Deathgirl wakes prematurely because she is more well-fed than the team expected (they had anticipated malnourishment and neglect, but her cell showed signs of rehabilitation). She copies Vector's telekinesis, then Synapse's nerve manipulation, then Evan's liquefaction in rapid succession - all without physical contact, revealing her power-copying is more advanced than intelligence suggested. The tunnel floor dissolves completely when she copies Evan's power, and she escapes into lower tunnels. Tarbaby reveals a tracking device was planted on Deathgirl as a pre-planned contingency that was deliberately not shared with Kingdom operatives. The team extracts via helicopter, with Red Calf treating Deathgirl's physical capture as secondary to removing her from government custody.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Captain Devil notes that "Mr. Nothing and Mr. Mudslide" are "both gone now" when reviewing known Kingdom operatives with Patriot (Interlude AM.1). Mr. Antithesis separately references Mudslide as an example of reforming "unusable louts" into something professional (Interlude TF.2).


## Trivia

- Has a minimal online footprint, limited to occasional posts on urban exploration forums under various pseudonyms.
- His baby blue eyes are first revealed in Ch. 41, visible through the holes in his paper bag mask.
- He is one of Sam's narrative foils, though he has no idea what a narrative foil is.
- The Daedalus extraction was deliberately timed to coincide with Boston protests and state senate hearings, maximizing political distraction.
