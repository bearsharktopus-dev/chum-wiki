## Background

Jason Reynolds gained his superhuman abilities in 2019 and was forced to quit football as a result, since competing in sports with powers raised fairness concerns. He received JLUMA approval the same year and joined the Young Defenders in 2020, quickly establishing himself as a reliable frontline presence.

He became the primary combat trainer for younger members, most notably Sam Small, whom he trained in boxing, bone conditioning, BJJ, and grappling beginning in fall 2023. When Crossroads graduated to the senior DVDs roster in summer 2024, Councilman Jamal Davis appointed Jason as the new Young Defenders leader, citing his physical and mental strength and dedication.

Jason led the team through a turbulent period including the Philly Phreaks' courthouse attack, the Chernobyl trial, and the rise of Pattinson's Pals. When Richardson's Superhuman Activity Regulation Act passed the Philadelphia City Council, he chose to graduate to the DVDs rather than operate illegally.

## Powers & Abilities

### Abilities

- **Kinetic Impact Nullification** - Selectively negates any kinetic force directed at him that he is aware of, including punches, bullets, and vehicle collisions. The nullified energy is channeled into the nearest large mass (typically the ground); when airborne, it disperses through the air as a mild gust. No upper limit has been found in laboratory testing - researchers have requested permission to acquire larger impacting devices.
- **Selective Activation** - Can choose which impacts to nullify, allowing normal interaction with objects and people while remaining invulnerable to hostile kinetic forces he is tracking.

### Limitations

- **Awareness Requirement** - Only activates against impacts he is consciously aware of. Attacks from blind spots or unseen angles land normally. Reaction time is within human norms (~220 ms).
- **Mental Strain** - Extended use causes mental (not physical) fatigue, reducing effectiveness during prolonged engagements.
- **Vulnerability to Non-Kinetic Attacks** - Susceptible to extreme temperatures, energy-based assaults (electricity, lightning), and airway obstructions. Nearly choked out by Pumice during the South Street battle despite being immovable.
- **Multi-Directional Overwhelm** - Rapid successive impacts from multiple directions can exceed his tracking capacity, particularly from unseen angles.

### Training & Skills

- Trained in grappling, BJJ, aikido, and pankration, specifically chosen to complement kinetic nullification - if he pins an opponent, they cannot escape unless they can harm him through non-kinetic force.
- Former football player; built like a linebacker even without powers.
- Experienced combat instructor who trained Sam in striking, bone conditioning, takedowns, ground positions, and submissions.
- Field leadership experience as Young Defenders team leader.
- Wears heavy ceramic and metal armor in the field.

## Personality

Jason is hard-headed but good-hearted, with a calm demeanor that becomes stoic under pressure. Straightforward and blunt, he thinks he knows best within his expertise but defers when out of his depth. He has a notable tendency to trust government institutions, often defaulting to the assumption that authorities will act properly.

He maintains a warm, older-brother dynamic with Sam - good-natured ribbing, hair-ruffling, and a rotating cast of nicknames ("Bee," "Smurfette," "Smallfry," "Bucky," "Annie Oakley," "Lemony Snicket"). He has a borderline religious devotion to Philadelphia sports (especially the Eagles) and habitually chews bubblegum. Despite his serious bearing, he shows flashes of dry humor and can be flustered by teasing. He harbors quiet bitterness about quitting football and is noted as religious but does not discuss it on duty.

## Arc Appearances

    **Role:** Supporting

    Introduced during Sam's first meeting with the Young Defenders - built like a linebacker with hazel eyes and a ring of blue, the only member wearing actual armor. Offers "ladies first" during testing, earning a "chauvinist" remark from Crossroads. Patrols with Sam in West Philadelphia, rescuing a cat from a tree using Wawa ham as bait. Wears minimal disguise on patrol: domino mask and spray dye in hair.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Trains Sam in bone conditioning, striking, and BJJ on a special Sunday session - proper punching form, kicks, double leg takedowns, guard positions, side control, full mount, and armbars. Notes Sam's regeneration means she never experiences DOMS and can use self-injury strategically. Gives Sam an overprotective warning about Gale that accidentally makes her cry. Provides Sam with a fake ID for the Crescent nightclub infiltration and runs visible patrol nearby as cover.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Frontline fighter alongside Sam for the South Street battle against the Philly Phreaks. Faces Pumice, holding his ground before being overwhelmed and nearly choked out - his immovable body still needs oxygen. Present at Liberty Belle's death scene at the refinery. Won a $20 bet against Playback about Sam and Jamila dating. Gives Sam a thumbs up when the team sets her up on a date with Gale at a Demon Core concert.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Teaching Spindle kicks at the gym, lifting weights as a "silent sentinel at the back." Attends a team party in formal clothes, doing the Macarena to every song. Asks Sam about her bandages at 11 PM, prompting her to tell the team about the Phreaks' ambush. Has accompanied Sam to the ER twice before for broken wrists from sandbag training. Has a deep conversation with Blink during the party. Sam credits his training throughout - blesses his pull-up regimen while climbing a fire escape and uses aikido holds he taught her.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present in the locker room after a fight, methodically removing gear. Participates in team debates about the emerging Jump/Fly crisis, questioning whether Rogue Wave are terrorists or ideologues. Present at the Sparkplug interrogation and the joint hero meeting about Rogue Wave. Sam notes his kinetic protection would be useless against electricity.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Spars with Sam post-breakup; she draws blood on his cheek for the first time. Debuts a new Gossamer-made costume with retro-reflective high-visibility trimming - the yellow glow intentionally draws enemy fire away from fragile teammates. Encounters a man undergoing a horrific Jump overdose mutation at Love Park during a late-night patrol with Sam. Absorbs metallic shrapnel with his power while Sam handles evacuation. Stabbed in the gut by a knife bypassing his armor. Seized and suplexed by Pumice, then hurled aside. Sam orders him to drag the mutant into the fountain to limit its firing arc. Spear-tackles Pumice during retreat but is thrown aside again. After the fight, Sam worries more about his injuries (blooming red across his costume) than her own. Provides balanced perspective during team debates about leaving the hero life. Appointed Young Defenders leader after Crossroads' graduation, pledging integrity and courage.

Orders a stand-down approach at team briefing, pledging to report through political channels. Present at the DVD headquarters meeting (Ch. 113) following the homecoming attack. Shows hostility toward Akilah Washington in Ch. 116 - their tense exchange suggests a complex personal history. Imposes a two-hour check-in requirement on Sam and half-jokingly threatens insubordination charges.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Trains Sam with advanced bone conditioning using gravel instead of rice. Goes on an unauthorized patrol with Sam in Olney under the code phrase "going to Wawa," confronting a Jump-dealing gang at a 9th Street construction site. A knife skitters off his arm like hitting concrete; a gang member who punches his jaw breaks his own hand. Subdues a dealer named Jackie, who has a violent involuntary Rogue Wave-triggered reaction - ignoring Rampart entirely to attack Sam with single-minded focus. Bear-hugs Jackie and smothers him unconscious. Takes full responsibility for the unauthorized patrol and accepts being grounded, telling the DVDs it was his idea as team leader.
