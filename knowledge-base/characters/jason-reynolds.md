## Background

Jason Reynolds gained his superhuman abilities in 2019 and was forced to quit football as a result, since competing in sports with powers raised fairness concerns. Despite his initial disappointment, he was enthusiastic about the prospect of becoming a superhero and received JLUMA approval the same year. He joined the Young Defenders in 2020 and quickly established himself as a reliable frontline presence, leveraging his kinetic impact nullification to shield teammates during field operations.

Over the following years, Jason's role on the team solidified. He became the primary combat trainer for younger members, most notably Sam Small, whom he trained in boxing fundamentals, bone conditioning, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and grappling techniques beginning in the fall of 2023. When Crossroads graduated to the senior Delaware Valley Defenders roster in the summer of 2024, Councilman Jamal Davis appointed Jason as the new leader of the Young Defenders, citing his physical and mental strength and his dedication to the team.

Jason led the Young Defenders through a turbulent period that included the Philly Phreaks' courthouse attack, the Chernobyl trial, and the rise of Pattinson's Pals. When Councilwoman Maya Richardson's anti-youth-vigilantism ordinance (the Superhuman Activity Regulation Act) passed the Philadelphia City Council, Jason chose to graduate to the Delaware Valley Defenders rather than operate illegally. He continues to serve as a professional hero on the senior team.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | F8/S/P/T |
| **Category** | Filch |
| **Power Ranking** | 8/10 |
| **Control** | 8/10 |
| **Hostility** | 1/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 3/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 4/10 |

### Abilities

- **Kinetic Impact Nullification** — Selectively negates any kinetic force directed at him that he is aware of, including punches, bullets, and collisions with vehicles. The nullified kinetic energy is channeled away and harmlessly dispersed into the nearest large mass, typically the ground. No upper limit to the magnitude of force he can nullify has been found in laboratory testing. When airborne, the energy disperses through the air, occasionally producing a mild gust.
- **Selective Activation** — Can choose which impacts to nullify, allowing him to interact normally with objects and people while remaining invulnerable to hostile kinetic forces he is tracking.

### Limitations

- **Awareness Requirement** — His power only activates against impacts he is consciously aware of. Attacks from blind spots, unseen angles, or those he fails to register will land normally. His reaction time is within human norms at approximately 220 milliseconds.
- **Mental Strain** — Extended or intensive use causes mental fatigue but not physical fatigue. Mental exhaustion can reduce his effectiveness and reaction time during prolonged engagements.
- **Vulnerability to Non-Kinetic Attacks** — Susceptible to extreme temperatures, energy-based assaults (such as electricity and lightning), and airway obstructions. His power does not protect against these threat types.
- **Multi-Directional Overwhelm** — Rapid successive impacts from multiple directions can overwhelm his ability to track and nullify all threats simultaneously, particularly if they come from unseen angles or exceed his capacity to remain aware.

### Training & Skills

- Trained in grappling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and pankration, specifically chosen to complement his kinetic nullification power. If he pins an opponent, they cannot escape unless they have a means of harming him through non-kinetic force.
- Former football player with an athletic background, contributing to his large, powerful build.
- Experienced combat instructor who trained Sam Small in striking technique, bone conditioning, takedowns, ground positions, and submission holds.
- Field leadership experience as Young Defenders team leader, including tactical coordination and crisis management.
- Wears heavy ceramic and metal armor in the field.

## Personality

Jason is hard-headed but good-hearted, carrying himself with a calm, composed demeanor that becomes increasingly stoic under pressure. He is straightforward and blunt, preferring direct communication over diplomacy. He thinks he knows best in situations that fall within his area of expertise but readily defers to others when he recognizes he is out of his depth. He has a notable tendency to trust government institutions and legal frameworks, often defaulting to the assumption that authorities will act properly. He is deeply protective of his teammates, frequently positioning himself as the team's frontline shield, and takes his responsibilities as both a hero and a trainer seriously.

He maintains a warm, older-brother dynamic with Sam Small, characterized by good-natured ribbing, hair-ruffling, and nicknames like "Smurfette" and "Lemony Snicket." He has a borderline religious devotion to Philadelphia sports, particularly the Eagles, and habitually chews bubblegum. Despite his serious bearing, he shows flashes of dry humor and can be flustered by teasing. He harbors a quiet bitterness about having to quit football when he gained his powers, though he keeps this to himself. He is noted as religious but does not discuss it while on duty.
