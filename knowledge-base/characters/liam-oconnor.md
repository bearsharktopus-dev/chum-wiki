??? warning "Background"

    Liam O'Connor is a fifteen-year-old metahuman from a working-class Irish Catholic family in South Philadelphia. He lives in a rowhouse that has been in the O'Connor family for generations, sharing a bedroom with his younger brother. He is the middle child of five siblings, and his extended family is deeply integrated into the neighborhood, with cousins described as living on nearly every block. His father, Sean O'Connor, is a union electrician, and his mother, Bridget O'Connor, works part-time as a dental receptionist. Money is sometimes tight, but the family is boisterous and tight-knit, with strong connections to their local parish.

    Liam first appeared as a member of Dr. Jensen's support group for traumatized superhumans, which Sam Small attended during her extended hospitalization in April 2024 following the Chernobyl confrontation. At that time, Liam was described as a teenage boy with a distant demeanor who found escape in fantasy novels. His specific powers were not disclosed during the group sessions, and Sam later admitted she could not remember what Liam's abilities were due to the fog of her lithium medication during that period.

    When Councilman Jamal Davis proposed his peer mentorship program in late October 2025, Liam was identified as one of four initial cases alongside Zara Khan, Alex Kirby, and Jasmine Walker. He had been flagged by Dr. Jensen, likely due to the dramatic and potentially frightening nature of his draconic transformation in public settings, compounded by his Catholic family's initial religious panic upon witnessing his powers. The O'Connor family had initially feared that Liam's abilities were demonic in origin, a misconception that was eventually corrected. Liam attended his first formal mentorship session at the Parkway Central Library in early November 2025, where he was reunited with Sam and introduced to Maggie O'Brien as a peer mentor. By the time of the mentorship program's launch, Liam had grown significantly, having gained at least six inches in height since Sam last saw him in the therapy group.

??? note "Powers & Abilities"

    **PERKS Assessment**

    No official PERKS assessment on file.

    **Abilities**

    - **Draconic Transformation (Full)** - Liam can transform his entire body into a dragon form described as classic Slavic/European in style, resembling creatures from Chernobog or Lindwurm mythology rather than any Irish dragon tradition. The full transformation is extremely draining physically.
    - **Partial Transformation** - Liam can selectively transform individual limbs or body parts, such as producing black scales, claws, and horn-like protrusions on his arms. He describes the sensation as warm and pressure-like, as though something beneath the skin is pushing outward. As of the beginning of Arc 16, he can sustain partial dragon-arms for approximately two minutes while keeping his torso and legs in human form.
    - **Hybrid Form** - Liam can achieve an intermediate state between full human and full dragon, though the specifics and limitations of this form are not fully documented.
    - **Eye Transformation** - Liam can transform his eyes to a reptilian amber with slit pupils. He has demonstrated the ability to trigger this change nearly instantly, describing it as feeling increasingly natural with practice.
    - **Smoke Emission** - As a side effect of transformation, Liam exhales or emits smoke during periods of stress, anger, or intense focus. This involuntary emission led to a school incident in which he was reported for "exhaling smoke in a bathroom."

    **Limitations**

    - Full draconic transformation is described as extremely draining, suggesting a significant energy cost that limits sustained use.
    - The transformation is described as somewhat scary-looking, making public use a practical liability.
    - Liam has experienced getting temporarily stuck in a partially transformed state, particularly with his dragon-eye form, requiring guided relaxation and focused breathing to revert. Sam has been working with him specifically on avoiding getting "stuck" in transformed states.
    - Scales can begin creeping beyond the intended area of transformation during loss of concentration, requiring active effort to contain.
    - Transformation can be triggered involuntarily by stress, anger, and certain types of music.
    - Smoke emission occurs involuntarily during emotional or physical strain, creating the risk of exposure in public settings.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Receiving ongoing power control training through the mentorship program, with Sam Small as his primary trainer. Exercises focus on maintaining partial transformation during distractions, using rapid-fire questions to simulate real-world interruption.
    - Learned personalized grounding and de-escalation techniques: controlled breathing (inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth, counting to four) as an emergency reversion method.
    - Has expressed interest in becoming an electrician, following his father's trade.
    - Uses his powers casually for household tasks and has impressed classmates with demonstrations, though his peers are described as mostly bored of it by now.
    - Trained in de-escalation doctrine taught by Sam at the community center: do not engage Songbirds or provocateurs, understand the strategic difference between defensive and offensive use of powers, and recognize the political consequences of powered individuals harming civilians.

??? warning "Personality"

    Liam is characterized as the "good brash" counterpart to Alex Kirby's romantic brashness. He has a squeaky voice that is still cracking, and he carries himself as a teenager in the process of figuring things out, beginning to rebel in safe and measured ways rather than dramatic ones. He is well-liked despite average academics, possessing a natural humor and a willingness to stand up for others even when they annoy him. At his core, Liam wants good things for the world, his family, and his friends.

    His personality reflects his upbringing in a large, loud, tightly bonded family. He is not quiet or withdrawn, but neither is he reckless. Where Alex Kirby gravitates toward grand gestures and dramatic action, Liam's brashness is grounded and practical, shaped by a working-class environment where people speak directly and look out for one another. His initial fear that his powers were demonic speaks to the depth of his Catholic upbringing's influence, but his willingness to learn and adapt once corrected demonstrates a fundamentally open and good-natured disposition.

    **Role:** Minor

    First appears in Chapter 66 as a member of Dr. Jensen's support group for traumatized superhumans during Sam's hospitalization. Described as a teenage boy with blonde hair, a distant demeanor, and a sunken appearance Sam compares to a horror movie figure, though she notes he seems incapable of hurting anyone. Finds escape in fantasy novels. His powers are not disclosed during group sessions. Referenced again in Chapter 67 when Sam describes the group to Jordan, listing Liam's powers as unknown.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Identified by Councilman Davis as one of four initial mentorship cases during the Halloween night proposal at the Music Hall (Chapter 211). Attends first formal mentorship session at the Parkway Central Library (Chapter 212), where he reconnects with Sam, reveals his dragon transformation abilities, and discusses being reported at school for exhaling smoke in a bathroom. His sister Erin's connection to Maggie through weed sales is discovered. Liam's father's pragmatic philosophy about learning to live with powers is noted. Participates in the first outdoor power training session at Franklin Park (Chapter 213), demonstrating partial transformation with black scales, claws, and horn-like protrusions. Practices maintaining transformation during distractions. Successfully achieves instant eye transformation to reptilian amber but gets temporarily stuck, requiring Sam's guided relaxation to revert. Creates personalized safety cheat sheet with triggers (stress, anger, certain music) and emergency breathing technique. Departs on an undersized bicycle. Attends expanded mentorship meeting at the Music Hall (Chapter 215) with all four mentees present, where he recognizes Lily Chen from a Young Defenders action three years prior and demonstrates partial dragon transformation (slit pupils, amber eyes).

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Mentorship sessions relocate to the Small family home after the Music Hall attack. Attends Saturday session hosted by Sam's parents (Chapter 221). Participates in Pennypack Park training in January (Chapter 222), working on partial dragon transformations in the snow. Slips while transforming and falls toward Jasmine Walker, inadvertently triggering Jasmine's previously hidden chlorokinesis when dead branches and plants move to catch him. Career discussion during a later mentorship meeting reveals his aspiration to become an electrician like his father. Power practice shows significant progress: holds dragon-arms for approximately two minutes while maintaining human form elsewhere. Attends de-escalation review sessions. Present in the crowd at the Tacony Community Center grand opening alongside the other mentees. Referenced by McNulty at Patty's Bar, who knows the O'Connor family and tells Sam she is doing good work with him.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the Tacony Community Center grand opening event where Davis delivers his keynote speech (Chapter 233). Described as "around" at the center during its expanded operations, including Jump harm reduction services (Chapter 235). Present at the community center during a Songbird confrontation (Chapter 241), sitting on the couch hugging his backpack when Sam arrives to debrief the mentorship kids. Sam counsels the group on de-escalation: the provocation is the strategy, and a powered kid hurting a Songbird changes the narrative. Liam's father Sean arrives in his electrician's work truck, still in uniform with sawdust in his hair, and offers help without asking questions.


??? warning "Trivia"

    - Liam's dragon form follows Slavic/European dragon mythology (Chernobog/Lindwurm tradition), which is deliberately not Irish despite his Irish Catholic background.
    - The correction of his family's belief that his powers were demonic is memorialized with the blunt quote: "Dragons have long necks, demons don't, idiot."
    - He rides an undersized bicycle, a detail noted when he departs from the Franklin Park training session.
    - Liam's sister Erin has sold Maggie weed, a minor detail that connects the O'Connor family's social network to the Auditors through an unexpected channel.
    - McNulty of Pattinson's Pals knows the O'Connor family personally, indicating the family is well-known within South Philadelphia's community networks. McNulty's comment to Sam, praising her work with "the O'Connors' kid," represents a rare point of overlap between the Pals and the mentorship program.
    - His school reported him for "exhaling smoke in the bathroom," which was actually an involuntary side effect of his dragon transformation rather than any conventional misbehavior.
    - Liam was the catalyst for Jasmine Walker's power reveal: his accidental slip during training caused Jasmine's protective chlorokinesis to activate for the first time in front of the group.
    - He has expressed interest in following his father into the electrician trade, one of the few mentorship students with a concrete career aspiration outside of superheroics.
