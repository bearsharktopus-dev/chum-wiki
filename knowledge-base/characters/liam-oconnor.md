## Background

Liam O'Connor is a fifteen-year-old metahuman from a working-class Irish Catholic family in Frankford, Philadelphia. His father is a union electrician (O'CONNOR ELECTRIC), and his older sister Erin attended Goretti in South Philly. The family is boisterous and tight-knit, with his mother checking in frequently and his father showing up without hesitation when trouble arises.

Liam first appeared in Dr. Jensen's support group for traumatized superhumans during Sam Small's hospitalization (Chapter 66). When Councilman Davis launched his peer mentorship program in November 2025, Liam was one of four initial mentees alongside Zara Khan, Alex Kirby, and Jasmine Walker. By then he had grown at least six inches since Sam last saw him - gangly and awkward at fifteen, with blonde hair buzzed short on the sides. His neighbors had already complained about his full dragon transformation, and he had been reported at school for involuntarily exhaling smoke in a bathroom.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Draconic Transformation (Full)** - Liam can transform his entire body into a full dragon form. The full transformation is extremely draining physically and results in a significantly heavier body. He cannot fly without achieving full wings.
- **Partial Transformation** - Liam can selectively transform individual limbs or body parts, such as producing pitch-black scales, claws, and horn-like protrusions on his arms. He can also achieve an elongated neck, golden skin sheen, and altered teeth while maintaining a mostly human face. His voice becomes deeper and raspier in this state. He describes the sensation as warm and pressure-like, as though something beneath the skin is pushing outward. As of late Arc 15, he can sustain partial dragon-arms for approximately two minutes while keeping his torso and legs in human form, noting "the trick is the shoulders - if I let it get past my shoulders, the whole thing wants to cascade."
- **Hybrid Form** - Liam can achieve an intermediate state between full human and full dragon, combining dragon-scale arms, elongated neck, golden skin sheen, and altered teeth while retaining a mostly human form. He demonstrated this during Pennypack Park training in January.
- **Eye Transformation** - Liam can transform his eyes from their normal brown to a reptilian amber with slit pupils. He has demonstrated the ability to trigger this change nearly instantly, describing it as feeling increasingly natural with practice.
- **Smoke Emission** - As a side effect of transformation, Liam exhales or emits smoke during periods of stress, anger, or intense focus. This involuntary emission led to a school incident in which he was reported for "exhaling smoke in a bathroom."

### Limitations

- Full draconic transformation is described as extremely draining, suggesting a significant energy cost that limits sustained use.
- The transformation is described as somewhat scary-looking, making public use a practical liability.
- Liam has experienced getting temporarily stuck in a partially transformed state, particularly with his dragon-eye form, requiring guided relaxation and focused breathing to revert. Sam has been working with him specifically on avoiding getting "stuck" in transformed states.
- Scales can begin creeping beyond the intended area of transformation during loss of concentration, requiring active effort to contain.
- Transformation can be triggered involuntarily by stress, anger, and certain types of music.
- Smoke emission occurs involuntarily during emotional or physical strain, creating the risk of exposure in public settings.

### Training & Skills

- Receiving ongoing power control training from Sam Small, focusing on maintaining partial transformation during distractions via rapid-fire questions.
- Emergency reversion technique: controlled breathing (inhale through nose, exhale through mouth, counting to four).
- Aspires to become an electrician like his father - already knows half the trade and uses his dragon form to reach high places without a ladder.
- Trained in Sam's de-escalation doctrine: do not engage Songbirds or provocateurs, understand the strategic difference between defensive and offensive power use, and recognize political consequences of powered individuals harming civilians.

## Personality

Liam is the "good brash" counterpart to Alex Kirby's romantic brashness - grounded and practical where Alex gravitates toward grand gestures. He has a squeaky, still-cracking voice and carries himself as a teenager beginning to rebel in safe, measured ways. Well-liked despite average academics, he possesses natural humor and willingness to stand up for others even when they annoy him. He breaks serious silences first, snarks affectionately at his mentors, and gives friends meaningful looks when they need to calm down. At his core, Liam wants good things for the world, his family, and his friends.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Mentor | First met in Dr. Jensen's therapy group (April 2024). Leads his power control training; initially could not remember his powers due to medication fog. |
| Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) | Peer Mentor | Co-runs mentorship sessions. Connected to the O'Connor family through Erin, who has sold Maggie weed. |
| Mr. O'Connor | Father | Union electrician (O'CONNOR ELECTRIC). Pragmatic about powers - "powers aren't going away, so we'd better learn to live with them." A friend of his who can melt steel works as a welder making double pay. |
| Mrs. O'Connor | Mother | Drives Liam to meetings, texts every hour during sessions. Described as freaking out about neighborhood break-ins. |

| Unnamed Brother | Brother | Thought it was hilarious when Liam accidentally transformed his hand at dinner. |
| Zara Khan | Fellow Mentee | Trains alongside Liam; present at all documented mentorship sessions. |
| Alex Kirby (Hellhound) | Fellow Mentee | Personality foil - romantic idealist vs. Liam's grounded practicality. Warmed Liam with his flames after the Pennypack Park fall. |
| Jasmine Walker | Fellow Mentee | Liam's accidental slip during Pennypack Park training (Chapter 222) triggered Jasmine's previously hidden chlorokinesis for the first time. |
| Lily Chen (Blink) | Auditor | Recognized Lily at the Music Hall meeting from a fire at a bowling alley on South Street roughly three years prior. Visibly awed. |
| Jamal Davis | Program Coordinator | City Councilman who proposed the mentorship program. |

| McNulty (Bulldozer) | Family Acquaintance | Pattinson's Pals member who knows the O'Connor family personally. Told Sam she was doing good work with "the O'Connors' kid." |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Minor

    First appears in Chapter 66 as a member of Dr. Jensen's support group for traumatized superhumans during Sam's hospitalization. Described as about Sam's age, with blonde hair, a distant gaze, and a sunken appearance Sam compares to a horror movie figure, though she notes he seems incapable of hurting anyone. Finds escape in fantasy novels and talks about how his powers have made him feel isolated. His specific powers are not disclosed during group sessions, and Sam does not learn or retain what they are due to the fog of her lithium medication.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    One of four initial mentees in the mentorship program proposed by Councilman Davis in Chapter 211. Attends first formal mentorship session at the Parkway Central Library (Chapter 212), where he reconnects with Sam, reveals his dragon transformation abilities, and discusses being reported at school for exhaling smoke in a bathroom. His sister Erin's connection to Maggie through weed sales is discovered. Liam's father's pragmatic philosophy about learning to live with powers is noted. Described as gangly and awkward at fifteen, having shot up at least six inches since Sam last saw him, with blonde hair buzzed short on the sides. Participates in the first outdoor power training session at Franklin Park (Chapter 213), demonstrating partial transformation with pitch-black scales, claws, and horn-like protrusions on his arm. Practices maintaining transformation during rapid-fire question distractions. Successfully achieves near-instant eye transformation to reptilian amber but gets temporarily stuck, requiring Sam's guided relaxation to revert - his eyes return to their normal brown. Creates personalized safety cheat sheet with triggers (stress, anger, certain music) and emergency breathing technique (inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth, counting to four). Departs on an undersized bicycle. Attends expanded mentorship meeting at the Music Hall (Chapter 215) with all four mentees and Lily Chen present, where he recognizes Lily from a fire at a bowling alley on South Street roughly three years prior and demonstrates partial dragon transformation (slit pupils, amber eyes). His neighbors had previously complained about his full transformation.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Mentorship sessions relocate to the Small family home after the Music Hall attack. Attends Saturday session hosted by Sam's parents (Chapter 221), where his mom drops him off and he practices transforming in the alley between rowhouses before getting tired. Participates in Pennypack Park training on January 3rd (Chapter 222), working on partial dragon transformations in the snow. Practices alongside Alex while maintaining a dragon-scale arm, elongated neck, golden skin sheen, and altered teeth - his voice becomes deeper and raspier when partially shifted. Slips while shifting too fast, overcorrects on ice hidden under snow, and falls toward Jasmine Walker as a significantly heavier partial dragon, inadvertently triggering Jasmine's previously hidden chlorokinesis when a dead oak tree bends its branches to catch him before he crashes into her. Career discussion during a later mentorship meeting (Chapter 231) reveals his aspiration to become an electrician like his father - "good money, union benefits, and I already know half the trade." His father's work van reads O'CONNOR ELECTRIC. Sam frames it as "powers as tools, not identity" - "you're not 'Dragon Boy, Electrician,' you're an electrician who happens to have a useful trick." Power practice in this session shows significant progress: holds dragon-arms for approximately two minutes while maintaining human form elsewhere, noting "the trick is the shoulders - if I let it get past my shoulders, the whole thing wants to cascade." At the second meeting (January 31st), Liam is quieter, with his mom texting every hour. Attends de-escalation sessions.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the Tacony Community Center grand opening event where Davis delivers his keynote speech (Chapter 233). Sam spots him in the crowd alongside Zara, Alex, and Jasmine after the Songbirds arrive to disrupt the event. Described as "around" at the center during its expanded operations (Chapter 235), talking to staff members while Zara does homework and Jasmine attends individual therapy sessions. Present at the community center during a Songbird confrontation (Chapter 241), sitting on the couch hugging his backpack like a stuffed animal when Sam arrives to debrief the mentorship kids. Sam counsels the group on de-escalation: the provocation is the strategy, and a powered kid hurting a Songbird changes the narrative. Liam gives Alex a look that says "dude, just listen" when Alex resists sitting down. Sam also specifically notes that the danger is heightened for Zara and Jasmine as non-white kids, and Liam is among the white mentees she acknowledges have a different risk profile. Liam's father arrives in his electrician's work truck, still in uniform with sawdust in his hair, claps Liam on the shoulder, shakes Sam's hand, and offers help without asking questions. Referenced by McNulty at Patty's Bar (Chapter 238), who knows the O'Connor family personally and tells Sam she is doing good work with "the O'Connors' kid."


## Trivia

- Rides an undersized bicycle, noted when departing the Franklin Park training session.
