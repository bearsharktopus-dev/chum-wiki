## Background

Akilah Washington was a near-Olympic-level competitive gymnast before her spotter failed to catch her during a flip, breaking both ankles. Her telekinetic string powers manifested in that moment, tying her to the equipment like a cradle and saving her life. She spent three years convinced the spotter had sabotaged her. The injuries ended her gymnastics career permanently, and her first year of hero work relied entirely on upper-body swinging.

Liberty Belle found Akilah "bitter and alone" and recruited her to the Young Defenders, where she served as second-in-command under Labyrinth before being elevated to field leader as Belle's direct protege. The pressure of leadership - compounded by underlying mental health issues and severe sleep deprivation from solo patrols - culminated in a physical confrontation with Sam in the locker room (Book 2), after which she entered voluntary inpatient psychiatric treatment at the Elysium Behavioral Health and Wellness Center. She was diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (Fragile/Covert Type) and General Anxiety Disorder, treated with CBT and supportive therapy under Dr. Jane Harris. Her NPD diagnosis bars her from becoming a Registered Superhuman Entity, though she retains her LUMA.

After treatment and return to the team, Akilah resigned from the Young Defenders alongside Devonte Harris following the courthouse attack (Book 6), enrolling in a paramedic training program. She adopted the codename Marionette - "No more pretending to be something I'm not" - and transitioned into private investigation at Chambers & Woo Investigations on Diamond Street near Temple University, where she and Devonte assist with the investigation into the Kingdom of Keys.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | C6/SONIE/P/B |
| **Category** | Create |
| **Power Ranking** | 6/10 |
| **Control** | 9/10 |
| **Hostility** | 2/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 2/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 3/10 |

### Abilities

- **Telekinetic String Creation** - Generates up to ten invisible telekinetic strings from her fingertips, one per finger. The strings are approximately the thickness of a pencil and appear as a slight shimmer in the air, catching light like spiderwebs. They can attach to and manipulate objects within range.
- **String Projection** - Projects strings at approximately 200 meters per second. Upon impact, strings impart a slight arbitrary force of around 3 Newtons in the direction of travel. Unanchored strings retract at the same speed they are projected, with the sound of "a quiet whirr of a tape measure."
- **String Durability** - Strings possess roughly the tensile strength of steel cable and are non-conductive to both heat and electricity. They can be sheared with force exceeding 50,000 PSI, which produces an extremely unpleasant sensation for Akilah. Physical attacks such as slashing or swiping are ineffective against the strings.
- **Range** - Maximum extension of 112 meters in clear conditions. Requires line of sight to the targeted attachment point and guides strings visually.
- **Manipulation and Retraction** - Can manipulate each string individually with high precision. Retraction pulls objects toward her or propels her toward larger objects, operating on her own physical strength. Can create slack to form loops and knots.
- **Tactile Feedback** - Receives sensory feedback through her strings, allowing her to feel the objects they are attached to. This feedback enables precise control but can be overwhelming if too many complex sensations occur simultaneously.
- **Enhanced Mobility** - Uses strings for rappelling, grappling, and rapid traversal of urban environments in a manner comparable to Spider-Man. Pirouettes with every motion while swinging, spinning through the air. Has little wheels on her boots for additional ground mobility.
- **Combat Applications** - Employs strings as extended limbs to engage opponents at range, entangle objects, create barriers, use small objects as improvised meteor hammers, and has demonstrated knowledge of garrote techniques. Can physically restrain and manipulate people, pull them close, and form lattice structures beneath unconscious individuals to carry them safely. During the South Street battle, she hooked all ten strings around Chrysalis to stop her from interrupting Gale, and engaged in a "string-off" against Deathgirl's hair-strand strings (though outmatched in quantity - ten strings versus hundreds).

### Limitations

- **Physical Strain** - Extended or intensive use causes physical fatigue similar to rigorous exercise. Pulling force is limited to her own physical strength.
- **Mental Concentration** - Requires significant concentration to maintain control, especially when manipulating multiple strings in complex patterns simultaneously.
- **Visibility** - Strings can be detected by their shimmering effect against certain backgrounds or lighting conditions. Airborne dust, smoke, or similar particulates make strings more visible and impair precision.
- **Environmental Interference** - Chaotic environments with multiple moving objects impair targeting and control. Dust disrupted her string precision during the South Street fight. Attaching to heavy mobile objects such as vehicles can drag Akilah unwillingly.
- **Line of Sight** - Requires visual contact with the intended attachment point to project strings accurately.

### Training & Skills

- Former near-Olympic-level gymnast, providing exceptional agility and body control even after her career-ending injury.
- Trained in jiu-jitsu throws and breakfalls, which she taught to Sam.
- Years of YD field leadership experience: patrol briefings, rules of engagement, radio protocol.
- YD first aid training; enrolled in paramedic training after leaving the team.
- Professional investigation skills (surveillance, evidence analysis, counter-surveillance, legal documentation) from Chambers & Woo.
- Pre-med background at Temple University.

## Personality

Akilah is precise, articulate, and deliberate, carrying herself with a professional bearing shaped by therapy and her investigative career. Her voice is a dry, measured baritone (also called a "rich alto"), and she maintains a "glacier" personality that can shift into blunt directness. She speaks with authority and expects competence. Stoic by default but capable of charming, on-the-nose humor.

Beneath the controlled exterior, she struggles with the tension between her desire for significance and her understanding of her own flaws. She described her NPD as rooted in self-hatred: "I just can't not make everything about me somehow. And I'm always so afraid of stopping being useful." She noted that "all the worst people in my life are Cluster B," suggesting personal history with personality disorders beyond her own. She has demonstrated genuine accountability - sincerely apologizing to Sam at Elysium and permanently stepping down from leadership. She maintains a love-hate banter dynamic with Devonte Harris.

## Relationships

| Officer M. Reynolds | PERKS Interviewing Officer | Conducted assessments across three years (2020, 2021, 2023), noting consistent growth. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Introduced as the eldest of the Young Defenders and their leader by merit. Dark-skinned with fluffy curly hair (sides shaved), about Sam's height, wearing a black undersuit with purple-pink accent cloth over padding and big steel-toed boots with little wheels. Runs the team efficiently and keeps Playback in line by tugging his ear and snatching his beanie with her strings. Demonstrates the obstacle course first, using strings extensively as a safety net while walking the course on her hands. Disciplines Sam after an outburst during the course: "Get that chip off your shoulder. If you can't handle being assisted, go be a street vigilante. Or go to therapy." Gently carries Sam with strings after she faints, forming a lattice beneath her and manipulating her into recovery position. Trains Sam in jiu-jitsu throws and breakfalls over the following weeks, and conducts blood sense testing by pricking her finger with a lancet while Sam's nose was plugged. Assigns patrol routes and briefs the team on rules of engagement, designating Sam's blood sense as her priority tool over fighting. Notices a knowing exchange between Sam and Liberty Belle during a gym visit and grows suspicious, pulling Sam close with her strings to interrogate her. Sam deflects, but Akilah is not convinced. Goes to college and is 19 years old at this time.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Under extreme pressure from covering solo patrols until four in the morning while Liberty Belle is MIA, Akilah reaches her breaking point. She confronts Sam in the locker room, accusing her of hiding information about Liberty Belle. The confrontation turns physical when Akilah grabs Sam's forearms with strings tight enough to cut and slams her head against the lockers. Playback defuses the situation by replaying recorded audio of catching Belle vomiting and coughing, revealing her illness. Gale nearly slams Akilah into the ceiling defending Sam. Crossroads ends the crisis with two words: "Go take a nap." Akilah falls asleep within seconds from extreme sleep deprivation. Sam decides not to press charges, noting "She's clearly hurting, too." Akilah subsequently enters voluntary inpatient psychiatric treatment, leaving both YD leaders out of action (LB missing, Puppeteer in treatment). Crossroads assumes acting leadership in her absence. Her patrol territory covered Center City and parts of Drexel.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam and Lily visit Akilah at the Elysium Behavioral Health and Wellness Center. Her appearance has changed - hair cropped short in a boyish style (previously large, bountiful coils), frame softened from a month of inpatient care with less defined gymnast muscles. She reveals her diagnoses of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (Fragile/Covert Type) and General Anxiety Disorder, and offers a sincere apology to Sam. She shares insight into her NPD: "It's not about loving myself. It's about hating myself. Being afraid of myself." She permanently turns over YD leadership to Crossroads and confirms she cannot become an RSE due to the personality disorder diagnosis but can still hold a LUMA. She rejoins the team for the South Street battle against the Philly Phreaks, sitting stiffly with an air of apprehension but speaking thoughtfully about Kingdom involvement. During the fight, she hooks all ten strings around Chrysalis, engages in a string-off against Deathgirl (outmatched in quantity but her strings cannot be cut by physical attacks), gets clawed in the shoulders by Chrysalis, and helps pin Patches at the end alongside Spindle and Sam, getting dragged across asphalt in the process. Afterward, she is silently crying at the news of Belle's worsened cancer and cannot attend a team outing because of rescheduled therapy. During the Chernobyl crisis, she assists with rooftop evacuations in her black and purple costume, her strings catching light and shimmering like spiderwebs as she pirouettes from rooftop to rooftop.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Attends Liberty Belle's will reading at Goldman, Reid & Miller, arriving exactly fifteen minutes early dressed in a suit and tie with her hair pulled all the way back. Receives $100,000, described as being for "dedication and service as a protege and valued member of the Young Defenders." She is shocked, then cycles through complex emotions - she had believed Belle was grooming her for succession before Belle's death. She tells Sam honestly that part of her is hurt but trusts Belle's decision. Most of the inheritance will go toward student loans. She shows maturity about "knowing when to step back" and offers to take Sam shopping. Later, at a New Year's Eve party, Akilah wears a glittery top and calls Sam "Bee." She offers emotional support - "Whatever you're going through, Sam, we're here for you. You saw me at my lowest, and we're here to see you at yours" - and offers to tell Clara about Sam's situation, which triggers Sam's panic response. Others on the team look to her and Crossroads for leadership decisions.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Active participant in team discussions and operations. Present during the locker room banter after a fight, where she makes a condom joke about "natural elasticity" and suggests "Spindle's Threads" as a brand name, showing her normally stoic humor. Engages in a heated debate about the Fly drug with the team, arguing from a skeptical, scientific perspective: "Superpowers aren't something you can synthesize and distribute. That goes against everything we understand" and "The type of person seeking out artificial powers - paying to skip the 'near-death experience' queue - they're not looking to be heroes." Clashes mainly with Playback before Crossroads shuts the debate down. Present alongside Rampart during a later team operation, unhappy but unable to argue with results.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Supporting

    During the pivotal DVD meeting about Jump incidents, exchanges knowing looks with Crossroads and Rampart regarding the upcoming YD graduation timeline. During the graduation discussion, Akilah reveals that she has been struggling with personal issues "of an emotional and psychological nature" and has been diagnosed with a condition that would preclude her from registry beyond a LUMA. She declines to specify the condition, saying "the specifics are not important," which devastates Gossamer. Her withdrawal leaves Crossroads as the only viable graduation candidate. During the courthouse crisis, she is absent with Blink, working with crisis response teams. Uses her strings to rescue people from upper floors of a collapsing building. At the end of the arc, Akilah and Playback both resign from the Young Defenders effective immediately. Akilah announces she is enrolling in a paramedic training program: "It's the best way for me to be useful to society... given... you know." She tells Sam: "You've grown so much already... you'll continue to do great things."

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Returns in Chapter 116 alongside Devonte Harris. They arrive at the DVD gym in civilian clothes - Akilah with her hair in tight springs "like fireworks," wearing gym clothes - their keycards never having been deactivated. Jason (Rampart) reacts with hostility, and they share a tense exchange suggesting complex personal history. Akilah pulls Sam aside for a private meeting at the Tacony Music Hall with Jordan, Tasha, and Maggie present. She delivers a careful, measured briefing on Project Titan - a black ops program run by the military with NSRA cooperation that attempted to create elite enhanced soldiers and artificially produce superhumans with drugs. She identifies Patriot as an original test subject with documented war crimes from 2007-2013, including extrajudicial killings, torture of prisoners, and coverups of civilian casualties. She produces physical evidence - a baggie of dried blood with traces of Fly - proving Egalitarian is using the drug. She dismisses Sam's plan to confront Patriot: "I don't think appealing to the morality of a man who has personally committed war crimes is... a winning formula."

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    In a phone call with Sam (Chapter 125), Akilah reveals she is changing her codename from Puppeteer to Marionette - "at least it's honest. No more pretending to be something I'm not." She shares her philosophy on leaving superhero life: "The whole superhero gig... it's great when you're a kid. Playing cops and robbers. But eventually, you have to grow up." She frames leaving not as being forced out by her personality disorder but as "taking my destiny into my own hands." She and Devonte are already keeping their ears to the ground regarding the Kingdom. Later (Chapter 131), after Devonte is shot while investigating Kingdom operations near the docks, Akilah assists with first-aid pressure using her YD training and keeps him conscious as they navigate to the Music Hall. She handles the story for the arriving paramedics and delivers critical intelligence: "The Kingdom is going to heist a bunch of fucking rhinoceroses from the zoo" - Operation Ivory, which Devonte recorded while Akilah kept him alive en route. At the hospital, she confers with Multiplex and Fury Forge about the Kingdom's plan, her eyes showing the same blankness Sam had seen once before when she stepped down from the Young Defenders.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam calls Akilah as a last resort when the arson investigation around Tacony heats up and no other heroes are available. Akilah is initially reluctant - "I'm not interested in going door-to-door looking for an arsonist" - but agrees to keep watch and arrives in under twenty minutes in her Marionette costume (black, purple, and brick brown, designed for North Philadelphia streets). Jordan snarks about "Puppeteer to the rescue," and Sam corrects them: "It's Marionette now, and you also dragged my entire skull through a row of canned soup. People change." Akilah patrols through the night until 11 AM without complaint, leaving a note: "Patrolled until 11 AM. No sign of anything unusual. Lucky I'm not counting this as billable hours. Stay sharp."

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as continuing PI work at Chambers & Woo alongside Devonte.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam's parents agree to let her consult with Devonte Harris (Ventriloquist) and Akilah Washington (Marionette) at Chambers & Woo Investigations on Diamond Street near Temple. Akilah is now approximately 22, described as wearing braids in a high ponytail with glasses and displaying subtle telekinesis. She has a pre-med background. She and Devonte help with data transfer from USB drives containing approximately 200GB of AES-256 encrypted Kingdom files, noting they need a technolect to crack the encryption. Chambers & Woo is already tracking Kingdom shell companies including PharmaSyn, NextGen Biologics, and Helix Innovations, and the Tremont & Fairfax connection is a new angle for them. They offer to work the case pro bono.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Plays a critical role in the gambit against the Kingdom, using her invisible strings from the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge to fake Brainwash's commands by physically holding people in place.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam's EMT colleague Hector mentions Chambers & Woo and specifically Akilah. Sam internally notes she knows her.

## Trivia

- Her PERKS assessment was originally a JLUMA (juvenile license) in 2020, upgraded to a full LUMA in 2021 when she came of age.
- The YD leadership chain ran Labyrinth to Crossroads to Liberty Belle to Puppeteer, then back to Crossroads after Akilah's departure.
- Her fighting style is "sort of a Spider-Man."
- During the South Street fight, Deathgirl copied Akilah's string power but could only produce one string per strand of hair, lacking control. The sheer quantity (hundreds) outmatched Akilah's ten, but Akilah's strings could not be cut by physical attacks.
