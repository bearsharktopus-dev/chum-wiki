??? warning "Background"

    Akilah Washington was a competitive gymnast on an Olympic-level trajectory before an accident during a routine caused her to break both ankles. During the fall, her telekinetic string powers manifested for the first time, saving her from breaking her neck. The injuries ended her gymnastics career, but she was recruited into superhero work by Liberty Belle and joined the Young Defenders, initially serving as second-in-command under the prior leader, Labyrinth.

    Following Labyrinth's graduation from the team in 2021, Akilah ascended to the position of field leader. She led the Young Defenders through a turbulent period that included Liberty Belle's terminal illness and eventual death at the hands of Chernobyl. The pressure of leadership, compounded by underlying mental health issues, took a severe toll. Akilah had a confrontation with Sam Small in which she physically assaulted Sam using her strings, and was subsequently admitted to the Elysium Behavioral Health and Wellness Center for inpatient psychiatric treatment. During her stay, she was diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder and prescribed Quetiapine and Fluoxetine.

    In 2023, Akilah stepped down as leader of the Young Defenders, citing mental health concerns and personality incompatibilities. She later resigned from the team entirely alongside Devonte Harris to pursue personal goals. Akilah adopted the new codename Marionette and transitioned into private investigation work at Chambers & Woo Investigations, where she and Devonte now assist with the ongoing investigation into the Kingdom of Keys. Her NPD diagnosis bars her from becoming a Registered Superhuman Entity, though she retains her LUMA and can operate as a licensed vigilante.

    **PERKS Assessment**

    | **Classification** | C6/SONIE/P/B |
    | **Category** | Create |
    | **Power Ranking** | 6/10 |

    **Abilities**

    - **Telekinetic String Creation** - Generates up to ten invisible telekinetic strings from her fingertips, one per finger. The strings are approximately the thickness of a pencil and appear as a slight shimmer in the air. They can attach to and manipulate objects within range.
    - **String Projection** - Projects strings at approximately 200 meters per second. Upon impact, strings impart a slight arbitrary force of around 3 Newtons in the direction of travel. Unanchored strings retract at the same speed they are projected.
    - **String Durability** - Strings possess roughly the tensile strength of steel cable and are non-conductive to both heat and electricity. They can be sheared with force exceeding 50,000 PSI, which produces an extremely unpleasant sensation for Akilah.
    - **Range** - Maximum extension of 112 meters in clear conditions. Requires line of sight to the targeted attachment point and guides strings visually.
    - **Manipulation and Retraction** - Can manipulate each string individually with high precision. Retraction pulls objects toward her or propels her toward larger objects, operating on her own physical strength. Can create slack to form loops and knots.
    - **Tactile Feedback** - Receives sensory feedback through her strings, allowing her to feel the objects they are attached to. This feedback enables precise control but can be overwhelming if too many complex sensations occur simultaneously.
    - **Enhanced Mobility** - Uses strings for rappelling, grappling, and rapid traversal of urban environments in a manner comparable to Spider-Man.
    - **Combat Applications** - Employs strings as extended limbs to engage opponents at range, entangle objects, create barriers, use small objects as improvised meteor hammers, and has demonstrated knowledge of garrote techniques. Can also physically restrain and manipulate people.

    **Limitations**

    - **Physical Strain** - Extended or intensive use causes physical fatigue similar to rigorous exercise. Pulling force is limited to her own physical strength.
    - **Mental Concentration** - Requires significant concentration to maintain control, especially when manipulating multiple strings in complex patterns simultaneously.
    - **Visibility** - Strings can be detected by their shimmering effect against certain backgrounds or lighting conditions. Airborne dust, smoke, or similar particulates make strings more visible.
    - **Environmental Interference** - Chaotic environments with multiple moving objects impair targeting and control. Attaching to heavy mobile objects such as vehicles can drag Akilah unwillingly.
    - **Line of Sight** - Requires visual contact with the intended attachment point to project strings accurately.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Former Olympic-level gymnast, providing exceptional agility, spatial awareness, and body control even after her career-ending injury.
    - Trained in superhero field leadership and tactical coordination through years of leading the Young Defenders.
    - Professional investigation skills acquired through work at Chambers & Woo Investigations, including surveillance, evidence analysis, counter-surveillance protocols, and legal documentation.
    - Currently completing a college degree.

??? warning "Personality"

    Akilah is precise, articulate, and deliberate in her word choice, carrying herself with a professional bearing that reflects both her therapy and her investigative career. She has a narcissistic streak that she is now self-aware about following her NPD diagnosis and treatment, and she channels that self-awareness into measured, careful interactions. She speaks with authority and expects competence from those around her.

    Beneath the controlled exterior, Akilah struggles with the tension between her desire for significance and her understanding of her own flaws. She has demonstrated a capacity for genuine accountability, as shown by her formal apology to Sam Small after assaulting her. She maintains a love-hate dynamic with Devonte Harris, marked by constant banter that has settled into a comfortable rhythm over time. She represents a more mature, professional path through the superhero world, contrasting with both Sam's vigilantism and the government-aligned Argus Corps approach.
