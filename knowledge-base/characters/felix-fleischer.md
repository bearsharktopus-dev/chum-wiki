## Background

Felix Fleischer, known publicly as Dr. Necrosis, is a German-born supervillain who has operated primarily in the United States for over two decades, classified as an Ideological Power Entity. Described by TIME Magazine as "The World's Most Notorious Supervillain," his crusade targets pharmaceutical industry executives responsible for practices he deems cause mass suffering and death. His German accent has been worn smooth by years in the American Midwest.

Fleischer maintained a basement laboratory in an apparently abandoned Detroit building and has also operated out of Chicago. He funds his operations by selling novel pathogens to pharmaceutical companies with the stipulation that all resulting research be open-sourced and patents released to the public domain - the industry funding its own opposition. He went missing from Chicago circa late 2025/early 2026, tying up federal superhuman resources (Chapter 229).

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Novel Pathogen Engineering** - Fleischer possessed the superhuman ability to engineer novel pathogens with extraordinary precision. His power allowed him to create viruses and biological agents that traditional bioengineering could not replicate. He designed pathogens with specific incubation periods, symptom presentations, transmission limitations, and environmental vulnerabilities. His creations ranged from targeted lethal agents to non-lethal viruses engineered for maximum psychological impact with minimum physical harm.
- **Biological Precision Control** - Fleischer demonstrated the ability to engineer pathogens targeting extremely specific biological systems. In the Meridian outbreak of 2019, he created a virus that caused superficial capillary fragility in only the periorbital region and thenar eminence (palms), producing "stigmata" symptoms. The virus was photosensitive, nonviable outside climate-controlled conditions, and self-terminated within six hours. This level of biological specificity - controlling exactly which capillaries in which anatomical locations would be affected - exceeded conventional bioengineering capabilities.
- **Organ-Dissolving Toxin Creation** - Sam Small's early research described Dr. Necrosis as "infamous for his ghastly organ-dissolving toxins," indicating he also created highly destructive biological agents when his targets warranted lethal force.

### Limitations

- Fleischer's pathogen engineering appeared to require extensive preparation time. He stated that he spent months, sometimes years, designing individual pathogens.
- His pathogens required controlled conditions for deployment. The Meridian virus, for example, was fragile and photosensitive, necessitating specific environmental conditions for effective transmission.
- His operational security depended on physical infrastructure (laboratories, equipment) that could theoretically be located and raided.

### Training & Skills

- Expert-level knowledge of virology, epidemiology, and immunology; maintains active engagement with current literature.
- Sophisticated understanding of cultural psychology, religious iconography, and media dynamics, applied to maximize psychological impact of attacks (e.g., the Meridian "stigmata" outbreak).
- Skilled in operational security: encrypted communications, intermediaries, and elaborate vetting procedures.

## Personality

Fleischer is soft-spoken, precise, and deliberate, with fussy habits like adjusting chair angles and aligning objects with table edges. He maintains a sharp distinction between his civilian self and the Dr. Necrosis persona, which he describes as professional distance analogous to a surgeon's detachment. He becomes notably more animated discussing horror films - particularly John Carpenter - than his criminal activities, and consciously presents his humanity (burning eggs, playing piano badly) alongside his monstrous acts.

His philosophy centers on "pressure" rather than "catastrophe" - pathogen attacks framed as rhetorical arguments. He expresses contempt for "sloppy" imitators who escalate past the point of usefulness. His confirmed kill count is approximately a dozen over two decades, all targeted. He has stated his intention to eventually surrender to authorities when his work is finished.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Elena Martinez | Interview subject | Pharmaceutical corruption journalist who conducted the 2021 TIME interview. Broke the Meridian Therapeutics suppressed trial data story in 2016. Fleischer described her questions as "better than most." |
| Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business) | Ideologically opposed | Rejected Snake Oil's suggestion to recruit Fleischer, comparing it to "asking the Unabomber to consult on postal service efficiency." |
| Dr. Felix Ortega (Snake Oil) | Admirer | Expressed scientific admiration for Fleischer's capabilities and advocated collaboration; overruled by Sullivan. |
| Pink Mist, Miami Train Stalker, Shrike | Referenced as examples | Cited during the TIME interview as "sloppy" imitators who copy the aesthetics of ideological violence without substance. Fleischer did not know them personally. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam researched Dr. Necrosis during her investigation into Liberty Belle's injuries (Chapter 3), noting his reputation for organ-dissolving toxins and possible prior presence in the Philadelphia area.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only (Interlude LS.2)"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Snake Oil suggested recruiting or collaborating with Dr. Necrosis during a Rogue Wave candidate review session, envisioning retroviral vectors carrying Jump enhancement properties. Monkey Business rejected the idea due to ideological incompatibility, comparing it to "asking the Unabomber to consult on postal service efficiency." Sullivan noted that Fleischer was operating out of Chicago at the time and assessed that Fleischer would view Rogue Wave's drug distribution enterprise as exactly the kind of profit-driven medical innovation he was trying to destroy.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up (Interlude FF.1)"

    **Role:** POV (Interlude)

    Subject of a TIME Magazine interview conducted by journalist Elena Martinez in an abandoned building's basement laboratory in Detroit on August 10, 2021. Fleischer, wearing a skull helmet with red LEDs that resembled exposed teeth when deactivated, discussed his philosophy of targeted bioterrorism as "pressure" rather than "catastrophe" - framing pathogen attacks as rhetorical arguments with premises, evidence, and conclusions. Described the Meridian Therapeutics shareholder meeting "stigmata" outbreak of 2019, in which he engineered a virus causing superficial bleeding from eyes, palms, and scalp - photosensitive, nonviable outside climate-controlled conditions, and self-terminating within six hours. Explained his business model: selling novel pathogens to pharmaceutical companies with the stipulation that all resulting research be open-sourced and patents released to the public domain, using their payments to fund his campaigns against them. Drew a sharp distinction between himself and "sloppy" imitators like Pink Mist, the Miami Train Stalker, and Shrike, describing them as people who "leak" their psychology into their work and escalate past the point of usefulness. Discussed his views on the "Second Wave of Supervillainy," his kill count of approximately a dozen people over two decades (all targeted), his personal life (piano, cooking, horror films - particularly John Carpenter's _Prince of Darkness_), and his stated intention to eventually surrender to a superhuman containment facility when his work was complete.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Maxwell informed Sam and Ben Small that federal superhuman resources were unavailable because onshore federal superhumans were dealing with Dr. Necrosis having gone missing from Chicago two weeks prior, describing the situation as one that "nobody likes" (Chapter 229).


## Trivia

- His interlude code is "FF," with the TIME interview designated as Interlude FF.1.
- His favorite film is John Carpenter's _Prince of Darkness_ (1987), deliberately chosen over _The Thing_ as "the interesting choice."
- Wore a helmet with a sculpted grin and red LEDs that, when deactivated, resembled exposed teeth.
- Referenced the "Seven Hells" containment facilities by name, mentioning Daedalus and "Tartarus" (likely the Tantalus Detention Center).
- In Sam's early research (Chapter 3), listed alongside Cold Snap, Pyrausta, Chernobyl, and Blast Shadow as major regional villains.
- Described his approach to pathogen design as having "artistry" and compared imitators unfavorably as "fucking without protection" - ideology without disciplined boundaries.
- Moved with the posture of a man who had been tall his entire life, slightly hunched and careful with ceilings.
- Carried a consumer-grade taser for personal defense, suggesting no direct combat capabilities.
