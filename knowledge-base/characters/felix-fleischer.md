## Background

Felix Fleischer, known publicly as Dr. Necrosis, was a German-born supervillain who operated primarily in the United States for over two decades. He was classified as an Ideological Power Entity and was widely regarded as one of the most notorious supervillains in the world, described by TIME Magazine as "The World's Most Notorious Supervillain." His crusade targeted the pharmaceutical industry, specifically executives and corporate leadership responsible for practices he deemed responsible for mass suffering and death.

Fleischer's German accent was noted to have been worn smooth by years spent in the American Midwest. He maintained a basement laboratory in a building in Detroit that appeared abandoned from the outside, equipped with positive-pressure seals and scientific equipment. He also operated out of Chicago at various points, where news reports described his activities as "systematic dismantling of for-profit medical infrastructure." He employed encrypted communication channels, intermediaries, and extensive vetting procedures to maintain operational security.

In addition to his terror campaigns, Fleischer periodically created novel pathogens and sold them to pharmaceutical companies for research purposes, with the stipulation that all resulting research be open-sourced and any patents released to the public domain. He used the revenue from these transactions to fund his operations, a dynamic he described as the industry funding its own opposition.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Novel Pathogen Engineering** — Fleischer possessed the superhuman ability to engineer novel pathogens with extraordinary precision. His power allowed him to create viruses and biological agents that traditional bioengineering could not replicate. He designed pathogens with specific incubation periods, symptom presentations, transmission limitations, and environmental vulnerabilities. His creations ranged from targeted lethal agents to non-lethal viruses engineered for maximum psychological impact with minimum physical harm.
- **Biological Precision Control** — Fleischer demonstrated the ability to engineer pathogens targeting extremely specific biological systems. In the Meridian outbreak of 2019, he created a virus that caused superficial capillary fragility in only the periorbital region and thenar eminence (palms), producing "stigmata" symptoms. The virus was photosensitive, nonviable outside climate-controlled conditions, and self-terminated within six hours. This level of biological specificity — controlling exactly which capillaries in which anatomical locations would be affected — exceeded conventional bioengineering capabilities.
- **Organ-Dissolving Toxin Creation** — Sam Small's early research described Dr. Necrosis as "infamous for his ghastly organ-dissolving toxins," indicating he also created highly destructive biological agents when his targets warranted lethal force.

### Limitations

- Fleischer's pathogen engineering appeared to require extensive preparation time. He stated that he spent months, sometimes years, designing individual pathogens.
- His pathogens required controlled conditions for deployment. The Meridian virus, for example, was fragile and photosensitive, necessitating specific environmental conditions for effective transmission.
- He carried a consumer-grade taser for personal defense, suggesting his powers did not provide him with direct combat capabilities.
- His operational security depended on physical infrastructure (laboratories, equipment) that could theoretically be located and raided.

### Training & Skills

- Expert-level knowledge of virology, epidemiology, and immunology. Fleischer maintained active engagement with current scientific literature in these fields.
- Demonstrated sophisticated understanding of cultural psychology, religious iconography, and media dynamics, which he applied to maximize the psychological impact of his attacks.
- Skilled in operational security, employing encrypted communications, intermediaries, and elaborate vetting procedures.
- Possessed sufficient scientific expertise that pharmaceutical companies paid for access to his research, recognizing his creations as beyond conventional bioengineering capabilities.

## Personality

Fleischer presented as a methodical, intellectually rigorous individual who maintained a sharp distinction between his civilian identity and his Dr. Necrosis persona. In conversation, he was soft-spoken, precise, and deliberate, with a tendency toward small fussy gestures such as adjusting chair angles and aligning objects with table edges. He displayed genuine passion when discussing horror films, particularly the work of John Carpenter, and became notably more animated during these digressions than during discussions of his criminal activities. He described himself as someone who burned his eggs, played piano badly, and had opinions about horror films — a conscious effort to present his humanity alongside his monstrous acts.

His philosophy centered on the concept of "pressure" rather than "catastrophe." He framed his pathogen attacks as rhetorical arguments with premises, evidence, and conclusions, and drew a sharp distinction between himself and other criminal superhumans who used ideology as a costume for self-indulgent violence. He expressed contempt for those who "escalate past the point of usefulness" and whose work was "sloppy." He acknowledged the moral weight of his actions without apology, describing the Dr. Necrosis persona as a form of professional distance analogous to a surgeon's detachment. He stated his intention to eventually surrender to authorities when his work was finished, expressing acceptance of accountability while maintaining that his targets had faced none. Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business) assessed Fleischer as ideologically incompatible with profit-driven enterprises, noting that approaching him for collaboration would be futile because he wanted "complete elimination of profit motives in medical treatment."

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Elena Martinez | Interview subject | TIME Magazine journalist who conducted the August 2021 interview. Fleischer expressed respect for her scientific understanding and described her questions as "better than most." |
| Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business) | Unaffiliated; ideologically opposed | Sullivan discussed Fleischer as a potential collaborator at Snake Oil's suggestion but concluded that Fleischer's opposition to profit-based medicine made collaboration impossible, comparing the idea to "asking the Unabomber to consult on postal service efficiency." |
| Dr. Felix Ortega (Snake Oil) | Unaffiliated; admired by Ortega | Snake Oil expressed scientific admiration for Fleischer's viral engineering capabilities and advocated for collaboration with him, envisioning retroviral vectors carrying Jump enhancement properties. Sullivan overruled the idea. |
| Pink Mist | Referenced as example | Fleischer referenced figures like Pink Mist as examples of the type of "activist villains" he considered sloppy and self-indulgent, though he stated he did not know them personally. |
| Shrike | Referenced as example | Similarly referenced alongside Pink Mist as an example of villains who copied the aesthetics of ideological violence without the substance. |

## Arc Appearances

| Book | Role | Key Events |
|------|------|------------|
| Book 1 | Mentioned | Sam Small researched Dr. Necrosis during her investigation into Liberty Belle's injuries, noting his reputation for organ-dissolving toxins and a possible presence in the Philadelphia area years prior (Chapter 3). He remained on her suspect list due to his long operational history. |
| Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only (Interlude LS.2) | Mentioned | Snake Oil suggested recruiting or collaborating with Dr. Necrosis during a Rogue Wave candidate review session, envisioning retroviral vectors carrying Jump enhancement properties. Monkey Business rejected the idea due to ideological incompatibility, comparing it to "asking the Unabomber to consult on postal service efficiency." Sullivan noted that Fleischer was operating out of Chicago at the time and assessed that Fleischer would view Rogue Wave's drug distribution enterprise as exactly the kind of profit-driven medical innovation he was trying to destroy. |
| Intermission 15.5: This Side Up (Interlude FF.1) | POV (Interlude) | Subject of a TIME Magazine interview conducted by journalist Elena Martinez in an abandoned building's basement laboratory in Detroit on August 10, 2021. Fleischer, wearing a skull helmet with red LEDs that resembled exposed teeth when deactivated, discussed his philosophy of targeted bioterrorism as "pressure" rather than "catastrophe" -- framing pathogen attacks as rhetorical arguments with premises, evidence, and conclusions. Described the Meridian Therapeutics shareholder meeting "stigmata" outbreak of 2019, in which he engineered a virus causing superficial bleeding from palms and eye sockets -- photosensitive, nonviable outside climate-controlled conditions, and self-terminating within six hours. Explained his business model: selling novel pathogens to pharmaceutical companies with the stipulation that all resulting research be open-sourced and patents released to the public domain, using their payments to fund his campaigns against them. Drew a sharp distinction between himself and "sloppy" imitators like Shrike, describing them as people who "leak" their psychology into their work and escalate past the point of usefulness. Discussed his views on the "Second Wave of Supervillainy," his kill count of approximately a dozen people over two decades (all targeted), his personal life (piano, cooking, horror films -- particularly John Carpenter's _Prince of Darkness_), and his stated intention to eventually surrender to a superhuman containment facility when his work was complete. |
| Book 16 | Mentioned | Maxwell informed Sam and Ben Small that federal superhuman resources were unavailable because onshore federal superhumans were dealing with Dr. Necrosis having gone missing from Chicago two weeks prior, describing the situation as one that "nobody likes" (Chapter 229). |

## Trivia

- Fleischer's interlude code is "FF," with the TIME Magazine interview designated as Interlude FF.1.
- His favorite film was John Carpenter's _Prince of Darkness_ (1987), which he considered underrated. He deliberately chose it over _The Thing_ as "the interesting choice."
- He wore a helmet with a sculpted grin and red LEDs that, when deactivated, resembled exposed teeth. He removed the lower half during the interview to speak more easily.
- His personal hobbies included practicing piano (badly), cooking simple meals, watching films, and keeping up with scientific literature.
- He referenced the "Seven Hells" superhuman containment facilities by name, specifically mentioning Daedalus and "Tartarus" (no facility by that exact name exists among the Seven Hells; the closest is Tantalus Detention Center in Florida).
- In Sam's early research (Chapter 3), Dr. Necrosis was listed alongside Cold Snap, Pyrausta, Chernobyl, and Blast Shadow as major villains in the region.
- He described his approach to pathogen design as having "artistry" and compared it unfavorably to imitators who were "fucking without protection" — using their ideology without disciplined boundaries.
- Elena Martinez noted he was "not the worst person" she had ever spoken to, describing him as "a man who has looked at the world, identified something genuinely wrong with it, and decided that the appropriate response is carefully calibrated terror."
- His kill count was described as approximately a dozen confirmed deaths over two decades, all targeted.
- He moved with the posture of a man who had been tall his entire life, slightly hunched and careful with ceilings.
- When Rogue Wave discussed him in Interlude LS.2, Monkey Business assessed that Fleischer would view their drug distribution enterprise as exactly the kind of "entrepreneurial innovation" he was trying to destroy.
