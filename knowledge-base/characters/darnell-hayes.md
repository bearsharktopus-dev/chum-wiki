## Background

Darnell Hayes is a Kingdom of Keys enforcer and interrogator operating primarily out of the Philadelphia branch. Originally from the Bronx, he forms an inseparable operational duo with Lucas Donovan (Mr. Polygraph) - his power nullification complementing Polygraph's lie detection to devastating effect during metahuman interrogations.

Over the course of the story, Darnell has been involved in numerous Kingdom operations: overseeing Mudslide's initiation at the Dobson Textile Factory, the Philadelphia Zoo animal poaching heist (where he was captured), and the staged Soot interrogation. After being liberated from prison during a Kingdom-orchestrated highway ambush, he continued as a key Kingdom lieutenant - coordinating Hypeman production at the Camden backup facility, participating in the Daedalus prison break, and confronting the growing Rogue Wave threat. He has a daughter, Roxanne Elisabeth Hayes (age 6), with Maya Richardson, who lives with his relatives in the Bronx.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Power Nullification** - Darnell can negate other metahumans' powers through skin-to-skin contact. The effect is instantaneous - "like a switch being flipped" - and persists as long as he maintains contact. All abilities are cancelled simultaneously, including passive powers (demonstrated against Sam's regeneration/blood-sensing/shark teeth and Jordan's spatial distortions).
- **Comprehensive Scope** - The nullification does not work on technology (drones, machines) or abilities within the natural human range - Patriot's "peak human condition" was unaffected because there is nothing superhuman to turn off.

### Limitations

- **Contact Requirement** - Requires direct skin-to-skin touch. Targets can avoid nullification by preventing bare-skin contact; during the zoo fight, he specifically tried to wedge his switchblade past Sam's armored fabric to find exposed skin.
- **Single-Target Application** - Must physically touch the individual, limiting him to one target at a time in most combat scenarios.
- **No Effect on Non-Superhuman Abilities** - Cannot negate abilities within the natural human range. Birthday Suit overpowered him through sheer natural strength even while her superhuman abilities were being nullified (Arc 15).

### Training & Skills

- Experienced in close-quarters combat, grappling, and dirty fighting - uses his size and mass advantage with tackles, pins, and strangulation holds.
- Precise marksman - shot down a surveillance drone with a single shot in darkness (Ch. 12).
- Skilled interrogator who leverages his calm demeanor and nullification ability against metahuman targets.

## Personality

Darnell is notably cool, calm, and collected, presenting a professional demeanor that contrasts sharply with Mr. Polygraph's barely contained anger. His physical presence is described as fluid and graceful, and he moves with quiet deliberateness. Very little provokes genuine emotion; when he raises his voice, it is a deliberate tactical choice rather than a loss of control - even after being impaled through the gut with an iron bar at the Dobson Factory, he calmly ordered the retreat and walked out under his own power.

In group settings he maintains a quiet, observant presence - at the Lancaster steakhouse gathering (Arc 10), he sat silently staring at the table with sunglasses on while the team bantered, "you almost forget he's there." In private or on the phone, he is more vocal and engaged, showing dry humor and genuine warmth with his inner circle. He has sharp, suspicious instincts; after the staged Soot death, he confirmed the kill but noted the Washes' appearance felt "staged" and "rehearsed."

He carries a snub-nosed handgun described as "almost toyetic" in its rounded appearance, and has also used a switchblade and screwdriver as weapons.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Lucas Donovan (Mr. Polygraph) | Partner / Close friend | Described as "heterosexual life mates" despite meeting relatively recently. After Rogue Wave permanently extracted Polygraph's powers, Darnell reported the incident personally to Maya and Antithesis. |
| Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Former romantic partner / Co-parent | Romantically involved approximately seven years prior; share daughter Roxanne. Their relationship carries tension rooted in a past incident in Baltimore where Maya chose "what was best for the Kingdom" over Darnell. He serves as her primary emergency contact and shares private doubts with her. |
| Trent Fairfax (Mr. Antithesis) | Superior | Reports to him through the chain of command. The two maintain at least 15 feet of distance because Antithesis's powers create a dangerous interaction with Darnell's nullification. |
| Samantha Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary | Has fought Sam multiple times across the story (Dobson Factory, Philadelphia Zoo, subway intercept). Sam personally zip-tied him during the zoo heist. |
| Jordan Westwood (Safeguard) | Adversary | Fought Jordan at the Dobson Factory, where his nullification collapsed all of Jordan's spatial distortions on contact. Jordan stabbed him through the stomach with an iron bar. |
| Richard Johnson (Patriot) | Adversary | Recognized Darnell by surname during the subway intercept (Arc 16). Patriot's power is immune to nullification. |
| Evan Williams (Mr. Mudslide) | Colleague | Frequently operates alongside Mudslide on Kingdom assignments. Was incarcerated and subsequently rescued together from the PICC prison transport. |
| Maria Valdez (Mrs. Heartbeat) | Colleague | Worked alongside her during the zoo heist and at the docks (Interlude DH.2). Had a $50 bet with Darnell that no one would come snooping - Darnell lost. |
| Mrs. Quiet | Colleague | Collaborated during the Soot interrogation and positioned as Kingdom backup during the subway intercept (Arc 16). |
| Mr. Retribution | Colleague | Collaborated during the Soot interrogation. |
| Dr. Lena Trinh-Norwood (Mrs. Xenograft) | Colleague | Assigned with Polygraph to coordinate with her on rebuilding Hypeman production at the Camden backup facility. |
| Devonte Harris (Playback/Ventriloquist) | Adversary | Caught Devonte eavesdropping at the Bleigh Avenue docks and shot off a chunk of his upper ear before Akilah helped Devonte escape. |
| Roxanne Elisabeth Hayes | Daughter | Age 6, lives with Darnell's relatives in the Bronx. Maya uses Roxy's existence as leverage when manipulating others. |
| Director Iris Hayes | Relative | Darnell's cousin who runs a library. Neither party's connection is publicly known. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First appears at the Dobson Textile Factory (Ch. 12) alongside Mr. Polygraph and Mudslide, overseeing Mudslide's Kingdom initiation where a captive is buried alive. Described as a Black man with salt-and-pepper hair, cold gaze, dark eyes, wearing a navy blue suit and sunglasses with a holstered pistol. Shoots down Alex Garcia's surveillance drone with a single precise shot in darkness. When Sam is discovered, fires a warning shot that impacts next to her while Mudslide sinks her feet into the ground. His power is hinted at when Polygraph asks if his powers work on drones - they do not. In the brutal fight that follows (Ch. 13), his power is fully revealed: when he touches Jordan's skin, all spatial distortions instantly vanish and space snaps back to normal. Strangles Jordan, crushing their windpipe with his thumbs, before Jordan rams an iron bar all the way through his stomach and out the other side. Gets knocked unconscious by his own left hook to Jordan's helmeted head. Sam also attacks him - stabbing him in the shin/foot with a makeshift iron spear, biting his arm (shallow puncture marks, tearing out a small chunk of skin), and spitting teeth and metal chunks at him. Despite being impaled through the gut, he orders the retreat when police sirens approach and staggers out through a wall Mudslide liquefies, blood dripping from his mouth and wound, with the iron bar still lodged in his side. His gun was lost somewhere in Mudslide's liquefied ground during the fight.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Drone footage of the Dobson Factory murder is presented to the DVD (Ch. 15), identifying the Kingdom as a major threat. Sam's intel provides the names Mr. Nothing, Mr. Polygraph, and Mudslide - a major breakthrough, as the adults had known of the Kingdom for roughly two years but had zero operative names until now. Later referred to as "N" in "P and N" when a Kingdom operative references Sam having previously "fucked up P and N."

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Spinelli, a captured Philly Phreak, describes two suited Kingdom operatives who influenced his gang: a man in a green suit with a leopard print vest who "looked like a thumb" (Mr. T-Rex) and a Black man in a more normal black suit with sunglasses and a goatee (Mr. Nothing). Sam recognizes the description and identifies him by codename. Spinelli reveals the Kingdom "gifted" Deathgirl to the Phreaks.

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Interlude (MR.1)

    Guides Maya Richardson to safety via phone while she is pursued by a black SUV with New York plates through Philadelphia streets late at night. Coordinates with Mr. Camcorder (who has access to CCTV feeds) to direct Maya through side streets and a narrow alley to evade her pursuers. Instructs her to swap her Lexus at a trusted chop shop off Girard Avenue and proceed to the Kingdom safehouse at 12th and Pine, a two-bedroom condo on the sixth floor of a quiet residential building. Arranges for Mudslide to meet Maya at the safehouse with a bottle of Hennessy. Later briefs Maya and Mudslide via speakerphone on the upcoming Chernobyl trial and its implications for the Kingdom - noting Sam Small is the star witness and that the NSRA is facing scrutiny for possible involvement with Chernobyl. Advises caution and a low profile during increased scrutiny, while Maya proposes offering Kingdom services to the NSRA as independent security consultants. Darnell and Maya also discuss Rogue Wave's mind-control threat - people triggered to violence by hearing the phrase "Rogue Wave," a targeted compulsion rather than full mind control. The interlude ends with Maya seeing news coverage of Deathgirl's courthouse attack.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Referenced earlier in the arc when Akilah and Devonte report that Mr. Nothing and Mrs. Heartbeat were "whipping the goons' ass" about Operation Ivory preparations at the docks. In Interlude DH.2 (Devonte's POV), catches Devonte eavesdropping at the docks near 5245 Bleigh Avenue. Described as an enormous man in an immaculate all-black three-piece suit, the "biggest motherfucker" Devonte has ever seen, with a shiny forehead and salt-and-pepper hair. Sneaks up behind Devonte silently, clamps a hand on his shoulder, and puts a gun between his eyes. Taunts Devonte about losing a $50 bet to Mrs. Heartbeat about whether anyone would come snooping. Puts the gun to Devonte's head and fires - the shot rips off a chunk of Devonte's upper ear and carves a gouge across the side of his head. Devonte escapes with Akilah Washington's help as she arrives, using her puppet strings to fling Kingdom goons aside while Devonte deploys stolen sounds as distractions.

    Participates in the real heist at the Philadelphia Zoo, stealing poison dart frogs in the Reptile House alongside Mrs. Heartbeat and Mudslide while Mr. Tyrannosaur creates a massive distraction outside (Ch. 134). Described as tall, calm, with salt-and-pepper hair slicked back, dark eyes, tapping notes on his phone while directing the operation. Relays Mrs. Xenograft's instructions to keep wild-caught frogs (which are actually toxic) separate from captive-bred ones, noting there is no antivenom for the poison. When Sam's unsuppressed phone buzzes in the silent Reptile House, his gaze locks on her - "calm, indifferent, like he's been expecting this." Grabs Sam by the chin (the only exposed skin) and nullifies all her powers instantly. Points his pistol at her kneecap, threatening to shoot: "I know how fast you heal, Sam. But I also know how much it's going to hurt when I make sure you can't run anymore." Notes that "Upper management doesn't want you dead. Not yet. But they're fine with hurting you extremely badly." Maggie arrives and hits him square in the temple with a power-propelled baseball, loosening his grip. Maggie knocks the gun from his hand with a flat stone. Darnell orders Heartbeat and Mudslide to get out with the frog containers.

    In the final fight (Ch. 135), stabs Sam in the shoulder with a switchblade while she's checking on Maggie, then tries to wedge past her armored fabric to find exposed skin and nullify her powers. Uses his size and mass advantage to pin Sam, tackling her and pressing a knee into her stomach. Sam fights back with knees, elbows, and shark teeth, cracking his jaw and splitting his lip. Sam ultimately throws him off balance, knees him in the groin twice, and zip-ties his wrists above his head followed by a second set of zip-ties around his forearms. She presses down on his shoulders with her knees until he drops the switchblade. Captured and arrested alongside Mudslide. Mentioned in Interlude MR.3 when Maya receives a text from him.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Shown in custody via footage - stone-faced, dead silent, hands clasped on the table. Every question is answered with a single word: "Lawyer." Sam notes he "still makes my skin crawl... like he's somehow still out there." The stolen poison dart frogs remain unaccounted for.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam predicts a Kingdom rescue attempt for the prison transfer (Ch. 149). The Kingdom successfully liberates both Darnell and Mudslide during a highway ambush of the prison transport convoy on the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interlude RG.1), with Captain Plasma incapacitated during the operation. In Interlude BM.2 (Mr. Tyrannosaur POV), Darnell is present at the Kingdom-owned steakhouse in Lancaster during the post-operation gathering. Sits silently staring at the table with sunglasses on while the team banters - "you almost forget he's there." Remains silent throughout the entire interlude while colleagues debate steak orders, money laundering through restaurants, and Upper Management details.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Arrives unexpectedly alongside Mr. Retribution, Mrs. Quiet, and Mr. Polygraph at Lardner's Point Park during the staged Soot confrontation (Interlude SO.2, Sam-as-Soot's POV). Described as tall, wearing sunglasses at night, fresh out of prison, with fluid and graceful movement. Performs a visual sweep and announces: "Boys have secured the area. I don't see any civvies. E's asleep. It's do or die time, ladies" (E = Mr. ESP, whose rotating powers were not useful that night). The Kingdom pays the Washes $2,000 for first crack at questioning Soot. Darnell neutralizes "Soot's" smoke powers through physical contact while Polygraph interrogates. The Washes throw "Soot" into the Delaware River after Mrs. Quiet shoots her three times (two torso, one face).

    In Interlude MR.7 (Maya's POV), present at a Kingdom safehouse on Spruce Street in West Philly during Maya's debriefing. His first name - Darnell - is revealed here, along with their shared history: the Baltimore incident where Maya chose "what was best for the Kingdom" over him. He notes the Washes' appearance felt "staged" and "rehearsed." Maya assigns him and Polygraph to coordinate with Mrs. Xenograft on rebuilding Hypeman production at the Camden backup facility.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Participates in the Daedalus prison break, contracted by Red Calf/Porcelain for $2 million per surviving operator. Assigned to the B-Team providing a distraction while the primary extraction team targets Deathgirl. His role is neutralizing powered guards and disabling dampening systems via nullification. Described at the Kingdom planning meeting at Bella Notte restaurant in Staten Island as tall and imposing in an immaculate charcoal suit. During the operation, C-Team comms report that Mr. Nothing took an impact round and the B-Team is withdrawing.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Listed among Kingdom's known operatives in Sam's reconnaissance.

    After a multi-day stakeout at Roxborough Memorial Hospital, the Kingdom sends Darnell and Polygraph to investigate a PI named Rick who had been snooping - Rick is actually a geased Rogue Wave operative placed as bait. Rogue Wave's combat team ambushes them: Birthday Suit tackles Darnell and overpowers him through sheer natural strength even with her superhuman abilities nullified - "bench press several children just off natural strength." She plants a boot in his sternum and sends him flying. Dead Drop's ferrokinetic chains subdue other Kingdom operatives while Rush Order captures Polygraph for power extraction. Rush Order's speed briefly cuts out when Darnell touches him before Birthday Suit re-engages.

    Darnell calls Maya at 8:43 PM on her Kingdom burner phone (Interlude MR.9) to report the disaster. His voice is steady with an edge underneath. Pulled over near the zoo and confirmed he was not followed. Reports approximately 15 Rogue Wave contractors plus a combat team, four Kingdom members caught including Lucas, and Lucas dumped at a Camden police station two hours later - powers permanently gone. Describes the extraction as leaving Lucas unable to use his lie detection, "trying to move an amputated limb." Made eye contact with Rush Order: "we both knew exactly what was happening." Validates his tactical decision to avoid capture rather than attempt rescue.

    This triggers Antithesis's unprecedented personal attendance at a Port Richmond warehouse debrief. Darnell is already there sweeping for surveillance when Maya arrives at 11:40 PM. He maintains at least 15 feet from Antithesis, who states he is "not safe to touch right now." Provides his account to assembled Kingdom leadership. Antithesis gives Maya 72 hours to develop a comprehensive response to Bloodhound and pledges to acquire Fly to restore Polygraph's powers. This is the first arc where Darnell's full surname (Hayes) is confirmed.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Intercepts Sam on the Broad Street Line subway (Ch. 246) as she heads to meet Maya Richardson. Deliberately cuts his own fingertip so Sam can blood-sense him as a calling card. Demonstrates extensive intelligence about Sam's activities - EMT work, community center, meetings, all of it. Uses an ecological metaphor distinguishing between a "nuisance species" and an "apex predator," warning Sam she is becoming a "problem" requiring a different category of response. Threatens Sam with a screwdriver, describing in detail how he would put it through her eye while touching her to negate regeneration. Presents "door number one and a half" - if Sam fights, rowhomes in Northeast Philadelphia explode. Mrs. Quiet is positioned in an adjacent car with a violin case, and multiple Kingdom operatives are on the train.

    Forces Sam off at City Hall station, but Patriot appears on the platform and recognizes Darnell by surname ("Hayes") from the Zoo raid. Patriot presents a triangle of options (strategic goals, tactical goals, or freedom) and Darnell chooses freedom, departing. Sam stays calm throughout, tracking his vitals with blood sense, and pickpockets his screwdriver. Patriot's "peak human condition" power proves immune to nullification.

    In Interlude MR.10 (Maya's POV), it is revealed that Darnell and Maya have a daughter - Roxanne Elisabeth Hayes, age 6 - living with Darnell's relatives in the Bronx. Maya describes him as a "charming brother from the Bronx" with whom she had a relationship approximately seven years prior. Darnell's cousin Iris runs a library. Maya uses Roxy's existence as leverage when manipulating Turbo Jett, claiming the Kingdom holds Roxy hostage - though Maya's internal narration acknowledges her version is "everything accurate, nothing honest."

## Trivia

- He and Polygraph are described as "what Kevin Smith would call 'heterosexual life mates'" despite having met relatively recently.
- His Kingdom codename follows the alphabetical naming convention, with "Mr. Nothing" corresponding to N. Under Kingdom rules, losing one's powers means losing the letter designation - as happened to Polygraph after his depowerment.
- Sam pickpocketed his screwdriver during the subway confrontation (Arc 16) and later held it to her own neck as leverage during her meeting with Maya Richardson.
