## Background

Darnell Hayes is a founding member of the Kingdom of Keys, one of the most powerful criminal organizations operating in the northeastern United States. He serves as co-lead interrogator of the Philadelphia branch alongside his partner Lucas Donovan (Mr. Polygraph), with whom he forms an inseparable operational duo. His power to nullify other metahumans' abilities on contact makes him an exceptionally effective enforcer, particularly dangerous when paired with Polygraph's lie-detection capabilities during interrogations.

Darnell first appeared in the story when he and Mr. Polygraph oversaw a loyalty test for Mudslide at the abandoned Dobson Textile Factory, ordering Mudslide to murder a captive by burying him alive. This event was accidentally witnessed by Sam Small and Jordan Westwood, triggering a violent confrontation that established the Kingdom of Keys as a major antagonistic force. Over the course of the story, Darnell has been involved in numerous Kingdom operations ranging from interrogations and drug heists to prison transport rescues, consistently serving as one of the organization's most reliable operatives in Philadelphia.

Darnell was captured alongside Mudslide during the Philadelphia Zoo heist (Operation Ivory) and incarcerated at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center. He was subsequently liberated during a Kingdom-orchestrated ambush of a prison transport convoy on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in March 2025. Since his release, he has continued operating as a key Kingdom lieutenant, participating in interrogations, coordinating with Mrs. Xenograft on drug production, and responding to the growing threat of Rogue Wave.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Power Nullification** - Darnell can negate other metahumans' powers through physical contact, specifically skin-to-skin touch. The nullification persists as long as he maintains contact. This ability is particularly devastating against metahumans whose powers involve physical mutation or biological alteration, as it removes not only the primary ability but also the required secondary powers that keep their altered physiology functional (e.g., removing the secondary powers that prevent super-dense muscles from crushing their owner).
- **Comprehensive Nullification Scope** - His power cancels all abilities simultaneously upon contact, including passive powers. When he touched Sam Small during their encounters, her regeneration and blood-sensing abilities were neutralized. When he touched Jordan Westwood, their spatial distortions collapsed entirely.

### Limitations

- **Contact Requirement** - Power nullification requires direct physical contact, specifically skin-to-skin. Targets can avoid the effect by preventing bare-skin contact.
- **Single-Target Application** - He must physically touch the individual whose powers he wishes to negate, limiting him to one target at a time in most practical combat scenarios.

### Training & Skills

- Well-trained in street fighting, dirty tactics, brawling, and grappling. He and Polygraph are experienced enough in close-quarters combat to engage teenage metahumans and hold their own against seasoned heroes.
- Has begun taking boxing lessons to improve his hand-to-hand capabilities, described as wanting to "keep up with the Joneses."
- Second-best marksman in the Kingdom of Keys among those who do not possess a power that enhances their shooting.
- Skilled interrogator who leverages his calm demeanor and power-nullification ability to extract information from metahuman targets.

## Personality

Darnell is notably cool, calm, and collected, presenting a professional demeanor that contrasts sharply with his partner Mr. Polygraph's barely concealed anger. Very little provokes him to genuine emotion; when he raises his voice, it is a deliberate tactical choice rather than a loss of control. He has developed a philosophical outlook on life and death, informed largely by his experience killing people, which has led him to view life as a temporary and precious thing. He takes genuine satisfaction in his work, believing himself to be good at it, and derives meaning from his role within the Kingdom. He holds a coldly pragmatic view of his victims, reasoning that if they did not want to be on the wrong end of his gun, they should have made better choices.

Darnell maintains a quiet, observant presence in group settings. During the Kingdom's post-prison-transport gathering at a Lancaster steakhouse, he remained notably quiet throughout the team's conversations and banter. He shares a past romantic history with Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) and the two continue to have occasional flings, though their professional interactions carry an undercurrent of tension. His private conversations with Maya reveal a sharp, suspicious mind; after the staged death of Soot, he confirmed the kill but shared lingering doubts about missing details.
