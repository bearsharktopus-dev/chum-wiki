## Background

Zara Khan is a thirteen-year-old Pakistani-American silicakinetic from an upper-middle-class family in University City, Philadelphia. Her father, Dr. Tariq Khan, is an engineering professor at Drexel; her mother, Amina Khan, is a hospital pharmacist. The family identifies as secular Muslim while maintaining cultural connections. Zara's maternal grandmother recently moved in and is more traditionally religious, creating household tension. Zara attends a competitive magnet school and is academically excellent.

Zara first appeared in Dr. Jensen's support group for traumatized superhumans (Chapter 66), where Sam initially misidentified her powers as ESP. In November 2025, she joined the mentorship program as one of four initial cases, flagged by Dr. Jensen due to the dangerous potential of her abilities. At the first session, she revealed the true nature of her powers - silicakinesis - and disclosed that her father had been contacted by the government about "metahuman containment systems."

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Silicakinesis (Glass Manipulation)** - Zara possesses the ability to telekinetically manipulate glass and silica-based materials. She can move, lift, and control glass objects at a distance. She can control multiple small objects simultaneously in complex patterns, as demonstrated with glass marbles during mentorship training sessions.
- **Glass Sensing / Silica Echolocation** - Zara can sense "through" nearby glass she is able to manipulate, creating a form of echolocation or remote perception. This sensory component initially operated within an approximate thirty-foot radius and has since expanded to roughly fifty feet. Through this ability she can detect and identify glass objects even with her eyes closed, feel shapes, and differentiate warm from cold surfaces, though the input remains somewhat fuzzy. This ability was initially mistaken for ESP by both Zara and others in Dr. Jensen's support group.
- **Selective Filtering** - Through training with Sam, Zara has developed the ability to filter her glass awareness, isolating individual objects from the ambient sensory input rather than being overwhelmed by all glass within her range. She describes the process as like "tuning a radio, finding just one frequency among many."

### Limitations

- Larger glass objects such as windows and mirrors tend to shatter when Zara attempts to control them; her fine control is currently limited to smaller objects.
- A previous school incident involved accidentally shattering a classroom window while looking through it, indicating that passive perception and active manipulation can blur together involuntarily.
- Her sensory abilities can produce overwhelming input, particularly in environments with many glass surfaces, requiring ongoing training to filter awareness.
- Her power triggers include anxiety, being startled, and intense concentration - emotional states common to a thirteen-year-old, making involuntary activation a persistent risk.
- The kinetic component of her power is considered genuinely dangerous, as glass shards weaponized through telekinesis would be lethal. Therapy and training guidance deliberately avoids developing this capacity.

### Training & Skills

- Receives power control training from Sam Small and Maggie O'Brien through the mentorship program, focusing on selective sensing and controlled lifting exercises.
- Personalized emergency protocol: physical grounding (feet on floor, hands against solid objects) to regain control during involuntary activation.
- Has expressed interest in pursuing metahuman biology or environmental science as research careers.

## Personality

Zara is quiet, smart, and bookish - the "good shy" to Jasmine Walker's "bad shy." Genuinely curious and willing to engage on her interests rather than retreating from conversation entirely, she takes an academic approach to her powers, treating them as a problem to be studied rather than feared or weaponized. Her willingness to ask hard questions and express gratitude distinguishes her from more withdrawn peers.

She has a taste for macabre art and horror movies, a small rebellion against her parents' preference for educational media that is entirely unrelated to her activation. Despite the "villain power" nature of her abilities - glass shards as weapons being an archetypal antagonist tool - Zara is a fundamentally benign person, and this tension forms a key part of her characterization.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Mentor | First met in Dr. Jensen's support group. Leads her power control training. Zara hugged Sam after the Songbird attack - a significant display of trust for a normally reserved person. |
| Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) | Peer Mentor | Assists Sam in running mentorship sessions. |
| Dr. Tariq Khan | Father | Drexel engineering professor. Formal but friendly. Was contacted by the government about "metahuman containment systems," reacting with quiet fury. |
| Amina Khan | Mother | Hospital pharmacist. Attends parent sessions at the community center. |
| Maternal Grandmother | Grandmother | Recently moved in. More traditionally religious; views Zara's powers as a "test from God." Her anxiety about the political climate visibly affects Zara. |
| Liam O'Connor | Fellow Mentee | Both were in Dr. Jensen's original support group. Train together regularly. |
| Alex Kirby (Hellhound) | Fellow Mentee | Trains and meets with the group regularly. |
| Jasmine Walker | Fellow Mentee | The "bad shy" to Zara's "good shy." |
| Dr. Jensen | Former Therapist | Led the support group. Flagged Zara as a mentorship candidate due to her powers' dangerous potential. |
| Jamal Davis | Program Organizer | City Councilman who facilitated the mentorship program. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First appeared in Chapter 66 as a member of Dr. Jensen's support group for traumatized superhumans during Sam's hospital recovery. Described as the youngest member, approximately eleven or twelve, drawing macabre artwork in a notebook filled with pages of impressive but unsettling illustrations. Sam assessed her powers as ESP. Spoke in barely a whisper during introductions, mentioning she likes to draw. Referenced again in Chapter 67 when Sam describes group members' apparent abilities to Jordan.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Named as one of four initial cases for Davis's peer mentorship program proposed in Chapter 211. Attended the first mentorship session at the Parkway Central Library (Chapter 212), where she revealed her glass sensing and control abilities, demonstrated glass telekinesis by making a marble orbit her finger, and disclosed that her father was contacted by the government about "metahuman containment systems." Participated in power training at Franklin Park (Chapter 213), practicing with broken glass bottles Sam brought for the purpose, learning to sense glass within about thirty feet and create defensive barriers. Expressed genuine gratitude to Sam and displayed a real smile for the first time at the end of the Franklin Park session. Attended the expanded mentorship meeting at the Tacony Music Hall (Chapter 215) with all four mentees present, lifting a glass marble six inches during the power demonstration.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Attended mentorship meetings at Sam's house (Chapter 221) during the period when the Music Hall was under repair from the Garbage Day attack, with her sensing range having expanded to roughly fifty feet for glass. Her grandmother's anxiety about the political climate was noted as affecting Zara, giving her dark circles. Participated in mentorship career discussions, expressing interest in metahuman biology or environmental science as research fields. Practiced glass control at Pennypack Park (Chapter 222), lifting a beer bottle from the creek bed and holding it for seven seconds - up from five two weeks prior. Took notes during sessions and was described as the youngest and most careful of the mentees. Referenced in mentorship meetings throughout Sam's fugitive and post-fugitive period.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the Tacony Community Center grand opening (Chapter 233), spotted by Sam in the crowd. Present at the center during the Songbird attack (Chapter 241), where she asked the hard question - "what if they actually hurt someone?" - while the other mentees reacted with frustration, silence, or fear. Hugged Sam before leaving, a notable gesture given that she is normally a "hoverer not hugger." Her father Dr. Khan arrived furious in a quiet professor way. Sam addressed racial disparity in the justice system directly to Zara and Jasmine during the debrief, noting that the system is less forgiving toward them than toward white-passing kids. Referenced as continuing homework at the center, with her mother attending parent sessions. Appeared in mentorship meetings throughout the arc, including power practice where her glass echolocation abilities were noted.


## Trivia

- Her father's vehicle changes across chapters - a "sensible Volvo" in Chapter 213, a "dark blue Volvo" in Chapter 215, but a Prius by Chapter 231.
- Zara's physical grounding technique (feet on floor, hands against solid objects) contrasts with Liam O'Connor's breathing-based technique for his dragon transformation.
- Sam explicitly addressed racial disparity in the justice system to Zara and Jasmine during the Songbird debrief, noting that "the system is significantly less nice" to them than to white-presenting mentees.
