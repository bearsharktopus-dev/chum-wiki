## Background

Zara Khan first appeared as a member of Dr. Jensen's support group for traumatized superhumans, which Sam Small attended during her extended hospital recovery following the Chernobyl confrontation in early 2024. Zara was described as the youngest member of the group, approximately eleven or twelve years old at the time, and was noted for drawing macabre artwork during sessions. Sam initially assessed Zara's powers as ESP-related, unaware of the kinetic component of her abilities.

Zara comes from an upper-middle-class Pakistani-American family in the University City neighborhood of Philadelphia. Her father, Dr. Tariq Khan, is an engineering professor at Drexel University, and her mother, Amina Khan, works as a hospital pharmacist. The family identifies as secular Muslim while maintaining cultural connections. Zara's maternal grandmother recently moved into the household and is more traditionally religious, creating some tension within the home. Zara attends a competitive magnet school and is academically excellent.

In late October 2025, City Councilman Jamal Davis proposed a peer mentoring program for powered youth, identifying Zara as one of four initial cases alongside Liam O'Connor, Alex Kirby, and Jasmine Walker. Zara had been flagged by Dr. Jensen as a candidate due to the dangerous potential of her abilities. She was reunited with Sam during the first mentorship session at the Parkway Central Library in early November 2025, where she revealed the true nature of her powers — silicakinesis, not simply ESP — and disclosed that her father had been contacted by the government about "metahuman containment systems," implying federal awareness of her abilities specifically.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Silicakinesis (Glass Manipulation)** — Zara possesses the ability to telekinetically manipulate glass and silica-based materials. She can move, lift, and control glass objects at a distance. She can control multiple small objects simultaneously in complex patterns, as demonstrated with glass marbles during mentorship training sessions.
- **Glass Sensing / Silica Echolocation** — Zara can sense "through" nearby glass she is able to manipulate, creating a form of echolocation or remote perception. This sensory component operates within an approximate thirty-foot radius and allows her to detect and identify glass objects even with her eyes closed. This ability was initially mistaken for ESP by both Zara and others in Dr. Jensen's support group.
- **Selective Filtering** — Through training with Sam, Zara has developed the ability to filter her glass awareness, isolating individual objects from the ambient sensory input rather than being overwhelmed by all glass within her range. She describes the process as "tuning a radio, finding just one frequency."

### Limitations

- Larger glass objects such as windows and mirrors tend to shatter when Zara attempts to control them; her fine control is currently limited to smaller objects.
- A previous school incident involved accidentally shattering a classroom window while looking through it, indicating that passive perception and active manipulation can blur together involuntarily.
- Her sensory abilities can produce overwhelming input, particularly in environments with many glass surfaces, requiring ongoing training to filter awareness.
- Her power triggers include anxiety, being startled, and intense concentration — emotional states common to a thirteen-year-old, making involuntary activation a persistent risk.
- The kinetic component of her power is considered genuinely dangerous, as glass shards weaponized through telekinesis would be lethal. Therapy and training guidance deliberately avoids developing this capacity.

### Training & Skills

- Receives power control training from Sam Small and Maggie O'Brien through the Tacony Community Center mentorship program.
- Has learned selective glass sensing exercises, practicing identification of individual glass objects with eyes closed and lifting single objects without affecting others nearby.
- Maintains a personalized emergency protocol: physical grounding techniques (feet on floor, hands against solid objects) to regain control when powers activate involuntarily.
- Academically excellent student at a competitive magnet school, with a methodical and analytical approach to understanding her superhuman condition.

## Personality

Zara is quiet, smart, and bookish, embodying what Sam and the narrative describe as the "good shy" — a person who is genuinely curious and inquisitive when discussing topics within her knowledge, willing to engage on her interests rather than retreating from conversation entirely. She takes an academic and methodical approach to her powers, treating them as a problem to be studied and understood rather than something to fear or weaponize. Her willingness to ask questions and express gratitude distinguishes her from more withdrawn peers in the mentorship program.

Zara has a taste for macabre art and horror movies, a small rebellion against her parents' preference for educational media that is entirely unrelated to her activation or powers. This aesthetic sensibility was evident from her earliest appearances in Dr. Jensen's support group, where she drew disturbing artwork. Despite the "villain power" nature of her abilities — glass shards as weapons being an archetypal antagonist tool — Zara herself is a fundamentally benign person, and the tension between what her power could do and who she actually is forms a key part of her characterization.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Mentor | Met in Dr. Jensen's support group during Sam's hospital recovery. Reunited through the mentorship program. Sam works with Zara on filtering glass awareness and controlled lifting exercises. Zara hugged Sam after the Songbird attack on the community center — a significant display of trust. |
| Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) | Peer Mentor | Assists Sam in running mentorship sessions and power training. Present at Franklin Park and library sessions. |
| Dr. Tariq Khan | Father | Engineering professor at Drexel University. Drives Zara to training sessions in his Volvo. Was contacted by the government about "metahuman containment systems," reacting with quiet fury. Arrived at the community center after the Songbird attack described as "furious in a quiet professor way." |
| Amina Khan | Mother | Hospital pharmacist. Attends parent sessions at the community center. |
| Maternal Grandmother | Grandmother | Recently moved into the Khan household. More traditionally religious than the rest of the family, creating household tension. |
| Liam O'Connor | Fellow Mentee | Fellow member of the mentorship program. Both were in Dr. Jensen's original support group. Train together at Franklin Park and other sessions. |
| Alex Kirby (Hellhound) | Fellow Mentee | Fellow member of the mentorship program. Trains and meets with the group regularly. |
| Jasmine Walker | Fellow Mentee | Fellow member of the mentorship program. Jasmine is described as the "bad shy" to Zara's "good shy." |
| Dr. Jensen | Former Therapist | Led the superhuman support group where Zara was first introduced. Flagged Zara as a candidate for the mentorship program. |
| Jamal Davis | Program Organizer | City Councilman who identified Zara as one of four initial mentorship cases and facilitates the program. |

## Arc Appearances

| Book | Role | Key Events |
|------|------|------------|
| Intermission 4.5: Amnion | Supporting | First appeared in Chapter 66 as a member of Dr. Jensen's support group for traumatized superhumans during Sam's hospital recovery. Described as the youngest member, approximately eleven or twelve, drawing macabre artwork in a notebook filled with pages of impressive but unsettling illustrations. Sam assessed her powers as ESP. Spoke in barely a whisper during introductions, mentioning she likes to draw. Referenced again in Chapter 67 when Sam describes group members' apparent abilities to Jordan. |
| Book 14: Shelter in Place | Supporting | Named as one of four initial cases for Davis's peer mentorship program proposed in Chapter 211. Attended the first mentorship session at the Parkway Central Library (Chapter 212), where she revealed her glass sensing and control abilities and disclosed that her father was contacted by the government about "metahuman containment systems." Participated in power training at Franklin Park (Chapter 213), learning to filter glass awareness and lift single objects without affecting others. Demonstrated glass telekinesis with marbles. Expressed genuine gratitude to Sam and displayed a real smile for the first time. Attended the expanded mentorship meeting at the Tacony Music Hall (Chapter 215) with all four mentees present, demonstrating her abilities to the full group. |
| Book 15: Severe Weather Warning | Supporting | Attended mentorship meetings at Sam's house during the period when the Music Hall was under repair from the Garbage Day attack. Practiced glass control at Pennypack Park sessions (Chapter 222) with increasing precision and duration. Participated in mentorship career discussions, expressing interest in research. Referenced in mentorship meetings throughout Sam's fugitive and post-fugitive period. |
| Book 16: Category Five Hurricane | Supporting | Present at the Tacony Community Center grand opening. Present at the center during the Songbird attack (Chapter 241), where she was described as scared; hugged Sam before leaving. Her father Dr. Khan arrived furious. Sam addressed racial disparity in the justice system directly to Zara and Jasmine during the debrief. Referenced as continuing homework at the center, with her mother attending parent sessions. Appeared in mentorship meetings throughout the arc, including power practice where her glass echolocation abilities were noted. |

## Trivia

- Zara's power was initially misidentified as ESP by Sam and apparently by Zara herself, due to the sensory component of her silicakinesis being the most noticeable manifestation before she understood the kinetic aspect.
- The character reference guide explicitly notes that her macabre taste in art and horror movies is "completely unrelated to her activation," preempting the assumption that her dark aesthetic is connected to her powers or trauma.
- Her power is described as a classic "villain power" wielded by a benign person, creating a deliberate narrative tension between the destructive potential of glass manipulation and Zara's gentle personality.
- Her father's Volvo is mentioned twice in the canon documents as his vehicle for picking Zara up from training sessions.
- Zara's emergency grounding technique — feet on floor, hands against solid objects — is notably physical and tactile, contrasting with Liam O'Connor's breathing-based technique for his dragon transformation.
- Sam explicitly addressed racial disparity in the justice system to Zara and Jasmine during the Songbird debrief, noting that "the system is significantly less nice" to them than to white-presenting mentees.
- Her current status as of the beginning of Arc 16 is described as "Learning control. Making progress with selective sensing exercises."
