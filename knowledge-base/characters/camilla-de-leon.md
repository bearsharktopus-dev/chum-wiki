## Background

Camilla de Leon is Sam Small's maternal grandmother and the mother of Rachel Small (nee de Leon). She is Sephardic Jewish with Hispanic heritage tracing back to Brazil and Spain via the Alhambra Decree of 1492 -- the expulsion of Jews from Spain. This dual heritage means Sam carries both Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (paternal, through the Small family) and Sephardic/Hispanic ancestry (maternal, through Camilla), a fact Sam did not learn until meeting Camilla for the first time during her hospital recovery.

Camilla's relationship with her daughter Rachel is described as "extremely tense" with "deep unspecified history." Camilla had a "rotating carousel" of boyfriends in her youth, and Rachel is the product of one of those relationships -- specifically with Victor Blanc, a long-haul trucker with antisocial personality disorder traits who was physically abusive before abandoning the family when Rachel was young. Both Rachel and Camilla agree that Sam should never meet Victor. Rachel's maiden name is "de Leon," though Sam's profile references the "Blanc family" in connection with her Hispanic heritage.

Camilla has a current partner named Jerry. She drives a Lexus and is described in the character reference guide as "snickety and snippy" -- and more bluntly, as difficult to get along with. Despite this, she has demonstrated unexpected depth: she supported Rachel's decision to testify against Maya Richardson's anti-vigilante legislation and offered financial support if Rachel faced professional consequences.

The character reference guide also notes that Camilla described her home as one of "passion, learning, and conflict," and that Rachel was a "firecracker" in her youth -- suggesting that the mother-daughter tension has deep roots in shared temperament as much as specific grievances.

## Powers & Abilities

Camilla de Leon has no metahuman abilities.

## Personality

Camilla is sharp-tongued, direct, and unafraid of confrontation. Her arrival at Sam's hospital room was unannounced and forced past Rachel's resistance, establishing her as someone who acts on her own terms regardless of others' boundaries. She can be abrasive and difficult -- the character reference guide's assessment is uncharitable but clear about her tendency toward conflict.

However, Camilla also demonstrates vulnerability and genuine desire for family connection. By Sam's fifteenth birthday, she sits near the hospital room door, "present but peripheral" -- maintaining distance but showing she wants to be part of Sam's life despite years of absence. Her surprising support for Rachel's political testimony and offer of financial backup reveal a capacity for solidarity that complicates the purely antagonistic reading of her character.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Rachel Small (nee de Leon) | Daughter | Extremely strained relationship with deep unspecified history. Camilla's unannounced arrival at the hospital created immediate tension. Despite their difficulties, Camilla supported Rachel's decision to testify against Richardson's legislation and offered financial support. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Granddaughter | Sam met Camilla for the first time during her hospital recovery in Intermission 4.5. Their relationship is new and developing; Sam knew almost nothing about her maternal grandmother before this meeting. Camilla's arrival revealed Sam's Hispanic and Sephardic heritage. |
| Benjamin Small | Son-in-law | Ben barely knows Camilla. Present during the family dinner in Book 12 where Camilla unexpectedly appeared. |
| Morris "Pop-Pop Moe" Small | Family connection (in-law) | Moe tactfully mediates between Rachel and Camilla when tensions arise, including physically removing Camilla from the kitchen during the Book 12 family dinner to give Rachel space. |
| Victor Blanc | Former Partner | Rachel's father. A long-haul trucker with antisocial personality disorder who was physically abusive and abandoned the family when Rachel was young. Both Camilla and Rachel agree Sam should never meet him. Victor "dropped out of Camilla's life very fast." |
| David de Leon | Son (presumed) | Rachel's brother, whose existence is revealed by Victor Blanc in Book 13. Sam had never known about him. The exact nature of Camilla's relationship with David is not documented. |
| Jerry | Current Partner | Referenced in the plot threads as Camilla's current partner. No further details documented. |

## Arc Appearances

| Book | Role | Key Events |
|------|------|------------|
| Intermission 4.5: Amnion | Supporting | Arrives unannounced at Sam's hospital room (Ch. 65), forcing her way past Rachel. Her appearance reveals Sam's previously unknown Hispanic and Sephardic Jewish heritage through the de Leon family's connection to Brazil, Spain, and the Alhambra Decree. Creates immediate tension with Rachel, who warns Camilla not to mention Victor (Sam's maternal grandfather). Both Rachel and Camilla agree Sam must never meet him. By Sam's fifteenth birthday (Ch. 68), Camilla sits near the hospital room door -- "present but peripheral," slowly beginning to integrate into Sam's life. |
| Book 5: Mayfly | Mentioned | Camilla's continued presence is acknowledged through the Passover context, though her role is not deeply explored in this arc. Sam's Hispanic heritage discovery is referenced as an ongoing thread. |
| Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only | Supporting | Appears unexpectedly at the Small home for a family dinner alongside Pop-Pop Moe (Interlude RS.3). Her Lexus is in the driveway when Sam arrives home (Ch. 186). Tension escalates between Rachel and Camilla over Maya Richardson's threats to the library where Rachel works. Pop-Pop Moe tactfully removes Camilla from the kitchen so Rachel can speak privately with Ben. Camilla surprisingly supports Rachel's decision to testify against Richardson's legislation and offers financial support if Rachel faces professional consequences. Later, Rachel and Camilla debate the implications of the 300% spike in gun sales following the "Gun Dad" incident involving Ben. |
| Book 13: Burn After Reading | Mentioned | Referenced indirectly through the revelation that Rachel has a brother named David de Leon, disclosed by Victor Blanc (Ch. 200). This expands the de Leon family tree beyond what Camilla had previously revealed. |
| Book 14: Shelter in Place | Mentioned | Rachel mentions that her grandmother (Camilla's mother / Sam's maternal great-grandmother) died from lung cancer (Ch. 206), referenced in the context of concerns about Sam's regeneration and cancer risks. |

## Trivia

- Camilla's Sephardic Jewish heritage traces back to the Alhambra Decree of 1492, the expulsion of Jews from Spain, connecting the de Leon family to Brazil and Spain. This merges Sam's Ashkenazi Jewish paternal heritage with Sephardic/Hispanic maternal heritage.
- The character reference guide describes Camilla bluntly as "kind of a cunt" who had a "rotating carousel" of boyfriends in her youth, from which Rachel was born. This is the guide's characterization, not a narrative judgment.
- She is referred to as "Camilla Blanc" exactly once in the entire knowledge base (in Sam's relationship table), while "Camilla de Leon" is used everywhere else. "Blanc" is Victor's surname; "de Leon" appears to be Camilla's own family name.
- Rachel's maiden name is documented inconsistently: "Rachel Small (nee de Leon)" in Rachel's own profile versus references to the "Blanc family" in Sam's profile. "De Leon" appears to be the correct maternal family name.
- The grandmother who "died from lung cancer" mentioned in Book 14 (Ch. 206) appears to be Camilla's mother (Sam's great-grandmother), not Camilla herself, since Camilla is alive through the end of the documented arcs.
- The slow defrosting of Camilla's relationship with the Small family is tracked as a progressing thread across the intermission and later arcs.
- David de Leon, Rachel's brother and Sam's uncle, is revealed by Victor in Book 13 but remains completely unexplored as a character.
