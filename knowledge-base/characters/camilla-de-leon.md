## Background

Camilla de Leon is Sam Small's maternal grandmother and the mother of Rachel Small (nee de Leon). She is Sephardic Jewish with Hispanic heritage tracing to Brazil and Spain via the Alhambra Decree of 1492 - the Fernandes line fled to Brazil, while the de Leon line stayed in Spain longer before coming to America in the 19th century. Sam's meeting with Camilla during her hospital recovery (Intermission 4.5) revealed her previously unknown maternal heritage, adding Sephardic/Hispanic ancestry to Sam's Ashkenazi Jewish paternal line.

Camilla's relationship with Rachel is deeply strained, rooted in shared temperament - Camilla describes her home as one of "passion, learning, and conflict," and Rachel was a "firecracker" in her youth. Camilla had a "rotating carousel" of boyfriends and never married Victor Blanc, Rachel's father, with whom she had two children: David and Rachel. Victor was physically abusive and left the family when Rachel was around thirteen. Both Camilla and Rachel agree Sam should never meet him.

Camilla has a current partner named Jerry, drives a silver Lexus, and is described as "snickety and snippy." She has silver hair and shares the same stormy orange-brown eyes as Rachel.

## Powers & Abilities

Camilla de Leon has no metahuman abilities.

## Personality

Camilla is sharp-tongued, direct, and acts on her own terms regardless of others' boundaries. She can be abrasive and difficult, with a well-documented tendency toward conflict.

However, she also demonstrates vulnerability and genuine desire for family connection - maintaining a "present but peripheral" distance at Sam's birthday while slowly integrating into Sam's life. Her surprising support for Rachel's political testimony (Book 12) reveals a capacity for solidarity that complicates the purely antagonistic reading of her character. She expresses care through food, defaulting to stress-cooking as both comfort and communication.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Rachel Small (nee de Leon) | Daughter | Extremely strained relationship with deep unspecified history. Despite their difficulties, Camilla supported Rachel's testimony against Richardson's legislation and offered financial backup. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Granddaughter | First met during Sam's hospital recovery (Intermission 4.5). Their relationship is new and developing. |
| Benjamin Small | Son-in-law | Barely knows Camilla. According to Victor, many of Camilla's children attended Rachel and Ben's wedding. |
| Morris "Pop-Pop Moe" Small | Family connection (in-law) | Tactfully mediates between Rachel and Camilla when tensions arise. |
| Victor Blanc | Former Partner | Rachel's father. Long-haul trucker with antisocial personality disorder traits who was physically abusive. Suffered a massive stroke in 1983 when Rachel was seven. Left the family about six years later. Details revealed by Victor in Book 13 (Ch. 199-200). |
| David de Leon | Son | Rachel's older brother, revealed by Victor in Book 13 (Ch. 200). Victor describes David as a troublemaker who "was always pushing back, always breaking rules, always making Camilla cry." |
| Jerry | Current Partner | No further details documented. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Arrives unannounced at Sam's hospital room (Ch. 65), forcing her way past Rachel. Sam has never met her or heard her name before. Mom introduces her as "your maternal grandmother, Camilla de Leon." Camilla shares the same stormy orange-brown eyes as Rachel. She offers Sam the nickname "Mom-Mom or Cammy." Her appearance reveals Sam's previously unknown Hispanic and Sephardic Jewish heritage through the de Leon family's connection to Brazil, Spain, and the Alhambra Decree - the Fernandes line fled to Brazil, while the de Leon line stayed in Spain longer. Creates immediate tension with Rachel, who warns Camilla not to mention Victor (Sam's maternal grandfather). Both Rachel and Camilla agree Sam must never meet him. Camilla mentions her current partner Jerry. Before leaving, she kisses the top of Sam's bald head and tells her to get well soon. Sam agrees to "think about" letting Camilla into her life. By Sam's fifteenth birthday (Ch. 68), Camilla sits near the hospital room door - "present but peripheral," with a sharp-eyed but wavering gaze, slowly beginning to integrate into Sam's life.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Camilla does not attend the Passover seder (Ch. 71), but Sam mentions having had another "clandestine meeting" with her - Camilla was in the passenger seat when Mom picked Sam up from physical therapy. The family still refuses to tell Sam anything about the "bad grandfather," which Sam notes only makes her want to know more.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Camilla has a significant recurring presence throughout this arc. In the Shabbos dinner scene (Interlude rs-3, which takes place before Ch. 186), she arrives as a surprise visitor while Ben is making challah and Moe has prepared brisket. Moe subtly steers Camilla away so Rachel can tell Ben privately about Richardson's threatening visit to her library. Camilla surprises everyone by supporting Rachel's decision to testify at the Harrisburg hearings, declaring "Show them what de Leon women are made of," and offers financial backup if Rachel faces professional consequences.

    After Ben is shot during Sam's fight with Rush Order (Ch. 188), Camilla leaves a worried voicemail (Ch. 189): she saw the news, does not know exactly what happened, and offers to be there in two hours.

    Camilla attends Rachel's Parents of Powered Teens coalition meeting, sitting in the back (Interlude rs-dc-jf). She and Rachel have coffee afterward, discussing motion sensors and Sam's sneaking. Rachel's "cocaine Rachel" past and strained history with Camilla are hinted at, alongside Camilla's "boyfriend carousel."

    Her silver Lexus is in the driveway when Sam arrives home (Ch. 186). During Sam's recovery (Ch. 190), Camilla takes over the kitchen with hamin, stuffed eggplant, and shakshuka, engaging in passive-aggressive "kitchen diplomacy" with Rachel over soup seasoning. She knits in the living room, comments that Richardson being poised "doesn't make her right," and offers to accompany Rachel to the town hall. On the night Sam sneaks out as Bloodhound, Camilla is among those fooled by Sam's excuse of going to bed early.

    After Sam's town hall confrontation with Richardson (Ch. 192), Camilla is still at the house, stress-cooking hand pies. She commands Sam to "Sit. Eat. Then face the music," pats her shoulder with surprising gentleness, and nods her "painful, miserable approval" when Ben lectures Sam about the dangers of her vigilante activities. She calls out that everyone needs to eat more because they are "too skinny from all this revolution business."

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Victor Blanc's visit provides significant backstory about Camilla. He mentions Camilla was "terrible at math" (Ch. 199). In Ch. 200, Victor reveals how he met Camilla at Murphy's bar on Frankford Avenue - he hit a man bothering her and she found it "interesting." He describes their life together: they had David first, then Rachel four years later, never married, and lived "very separate" lives. After Victor's stroke in 1983 and eventual departure six years later, he sent Camilla what money he could. Victor also reveals that Camilla "has a lot of children" and that many of them attended Rachel and Ben's wedding, meaning Sam has a larger family than she knows. The revelation that Rachel has a brother named David de Leon expands the de Leon family tree beyond what Camilla had previously shared with Sam.


## Trivia

- She is referred to as "Camilla Blanc" exactly once (in Sam's relationship table); "de Leon" is used everywhere else and appears to be her own family name.
- Rachel's maiden name is documented inconsistently: "Rachel Small (nee de Leon)" in Rachel's own profile versus references to the "Blanc family" in Sam's profile.
- Victor reveals that Camilla "has a lot of children" and many attended Rachel and Ben's wedding, meaning Sam has a much larger extended family on the de Leon side than she realizes.
- David de Leon, Rachel's older brother and Sam's uncle, remains completely unexplored as a character after his Book 13 reveal.
- The slow defrosting of Camilla's relationship with the Small family is tracked as a progressing thread across the intermission and later arcs.
