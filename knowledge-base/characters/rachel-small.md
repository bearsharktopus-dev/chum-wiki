## Background

Rachel Small is the mother of Samantha "Sam" Small, the series protagonist, and the wife of Benjamin "Ben" Small. She works as a librarian for the City of Philadelphia, a position that grants her research skills, institutional knowledge, and access to archival materials that prove unexpectedly valuable to Sam's investigations. Rachel manages bipolar disorder with medication, a condition she has expressed concern Sam may have inherited.

Rachel was born Rachel de Leon, the daughter of Camilla de Leon and Victor Blanc. Her upbringing was turbulent; Camilla had a "rotating carousel" of boyfriends, and Victor -- a long-haul trucker with antisocial personality disorder traits -- was physically abusive before abandoning the family when Rachel was young. Rachel grew up in what Camilla described as a home of "passion, learning, and conflict," and was herself a "firecracker" in her youth. She attended Drexel University, where she met Ben. Rachel has maintained an extremely tense relationship with her mother Camilla throughout her adult life and had completely cut Victor out of her existence until his unexpected arrival in Philadelphia during Arc 13.

Rachel was aware of Sam's metahuman abilities from the beginning, co-signing Sam's provisional Juvenile License to Utilize Metahuman Abilities (JLUMA) alongside Ben in August 2023. She initially occupied a supportive but anxious parental role, raising practical concerns about insurance, scheduling, and college applications when Liberty Belle recruited Sam for the Young Defenders. Over the course of the series, Rachel evolved from a worried parent into a formidable political organizer, founding the Parents of Powered Kids Coalition in response to Maya Richardson's anti-vigilante legislation and ultimately helping defeat that legislation at the state level.

## Personality

Rachel is more emotionally expressive and openly protective than her husband Ben, serving as the "good cop" to his more analytical "bad cop" approach in parenting. She wears her worry and her love on her sleeve, and her reactions to Sam's injuries and close calls are visceral and immediate. She manages bipolar disorder with medication and has voiced concern that Sam may have inherited the condition. Rachel enjoys wine -- she became noticeably intoxicated during the family's first Shabbat dinner at Pop-pop Moe's house -- and secretly reads genre fiction.

Beneath the warmth and worry, Rachel possesses a pragmatic streak and a capacity for strategic thinking that emerges decisively when her family is threatened. Rather than merely opposing Sam's vigilante activities, she takes a more realistic view than Ben, recognizing that outright prohibition is futile and instead working to establish boundaries that manage risk. When Maya Richardson threatened her at her workplace, Rachel did not cower; she stood her ground, implied Richardson looked old, and channeled her anger into founding a political movement. Her testimony at the Pennsylvania state senate hearings was instrumental in defeating anti-vigilante legislation, and her coalition spread to fourteen cities across the Northeast. She installed motion sensors on Sam's windows not to prevent her from leaving, but to know when she left -- a distinction that reveals her understanding that control is less effective than awareness.

Rachel carries deep trauma from her childhood with Victor Blanc. His unexpected appearance in Arc 13 triggered visible terror and emotional collapse, and she explicitly forbade Sam from contacting him. Her fear that Sam might inherit Victor's antisocial tendencies informs much of her protective behavior and contextualizes her approach to parenting a daughter with violent capabilities.

Richardson delivers veiled threats about "extracurricular activities" and "bad influences," implying Rachel's job could be at risk via budget cuts. Rachel stands her ground, directly asking if she is being threatened and implying Richardson looks old. Later at home, she finds Ben, Moe (expected), and her mother Camilla (unexpected) visiting. Moe tactfully removes Camilla from the kitchen so Rachel can detail the confrontation privately to Ben. Ben insists they tell Sam about the threats. Camilla surprisingly supports Rachel's decision to oppose the legislation. Decides to oppose the state senate version of Richardson's anti-vigilante ordinance and plans to testify at Harrisburg hearings. Drives Sam to South Philadelphia to track Elias after Derek's emergency call.

Afterward, she meets Camilla for coffee, revealing she installed motion sensors on Sam's windows as a compromise between trust and verification.

After Sam escapes Captain Devil, Rachel calmly establishes punishment (library volunteering, physical therapy assistance, tracker) while acknowledging pride in Sam's convictions. Coalition gains national momentum, spreading to multiple states. |
| Book 13: Burn After Reading | Major | Drives Sam to Harrisburg for state senate hearings. Delivers powerful testimony linking the Boston incident to fear-based policies and arguing that the Daedalus breach demonstrates flaws in the current approach to powered individuals. Her testimony helps defeat the anti-vigilante bill in committee 11-9. On the return trip, spots Victor Blanc's truck outside their home and panics. Exhibits extreme terror during Victor's visit, trembling and attempting to end the encounter; collapses emotionally after he leaves and calls in sick to work. Explicitly forbids Sam from contacting Victor. Coordinates with authorities during the Shrike crisis, demonstrating practiced evacuation skills. Introduces Sam to the Morrison Collection at the library, teaching her the digitization process and explaining the importance of metadata.

Participates in family therapy sessions with Dr. Kaplan, where inherited self-reliance patterns tracing back through Ben, Pop-pop Moe, and Holocaust survivor Leah are examined (Ch. 213). Contacts Nina de la Cruz through Dr. Jensen as genuine outreach rather than intelligence gathering -- Nina is a 24-year-old barback at Crescent nightclub with electrical powers, trapped by financial obligations supporting her sister. Rachel commits to genuinely helping Nina regardless of investigation value, declaring she would help "even if they send two T-Rexes and the Mayor" (Ch. 216). Arrives at the hospital and pulls Sam into a tight hug after the Garbage Day attack on the Music Hall that dislocates Tasha's shoulder (Ch. 218). |
| Book 15: Severe Weather Warning | Supporting | After Sam flees Patriot and Turbo Jett's arrest, Rachel and Ben hire Gerald "Jerry" Caldwell (Chernobyl's former lawyer) to represent Sam, leaving a voicemail telling Sam they have retained legal counsel and will not cooperate with authorities beyond legal requirements.

Her acceptance of Megalodon is framed not as permission but as acknowledgment that the terms of the situation have been accepted by all parties. Continues coalition work with a state legislator on a powered youth protection act (referenced in phone calls throughout the arc). Mentioned alongside Ben as hosting Maxwell Martinez during his three-month recovery. |
