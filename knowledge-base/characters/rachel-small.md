## Background

Rachel Esther Small (nee de Leon) is Sam Small's mother and Ben Small's wife. She works as a librarian for the City of Philadelphia, cycling through branches over the course of the story (Tacony, Northeast Regional, South Branch). Her professional research skills prove unexpectedly valuable to Sam's investigations. She manages bipolar disorder with medication, a condition she fears Sam may have inherited. Physically, she has tan skin, freckled cheeks, wavy lighter brown hair (often in a messy bun), a button nose, and is the same height as Sam but heavier.

Rachel's upbringing was turbulent. Her father Victor Blanc - a long-haul trucker who self-identifies as a sociopath - was physically abusive before a massive stroke in 1983 changed his personality. He left the family roughly six years later. Her mother Camilla's "boyfriend carousel" and the home's atmosphere of "passion, learning, and conflict" shaped Rachel into a self-described "firecracker." She attended Drexel University, where she met Ben. She has a brother, David de Leon, whose existence Sam was unaware of until Arc 13. Rachel cut Victor out of her life entirely until his unexpected arrival in Arc 13.

Rachel co-signed Sam's JLUMA alongside Ben in August 2023 and initially occupied a supportive but anxious parental role. Over the series, she evolved from worried parent into formidable political organizer, founding the Parents of Powered Kids Coalition in response to Maya Richardson's anti-vigilante legislation and helping defeat it at the state level.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- None. Rachel is a baseline human with no metahuman powers.

### Limitations

- As an unpowered civilian, Rachel has no enhanced durability, combat ability, or any other superhuman traits.

### Training & Skills

- **Library Science and Archival Research** - Professional expertise in information retrieval, cataloging, digitization, and metadata management. Introduced Sam to the Morrison Collection, which contains decades of superhuman history (Arc 13).
- **Political Organizing** - Built the Parents of Powered Kids Coalition from scratch, growing it from 14 attendees to thousands of subscribers and chapters across multiple states with secure communications and legislative testimony strategy.
- **Legal Knowledge** - Surprised Sam and Monkey Business with unexpected understanding of juvenile contract voidability during Rogue Wave negotiations (Arc 14).
- **Crisis Management** - Calm and decisive under extreme pressure, as demonstrated during the Shrike home invasion evacuation (Arc 14).
- **Confrontational Courage** - Long history of standing up to authority. As a young librarian circa 2001, confronted an INS agent, punched a process server, and got the agent reassigned (Arc 6).

## Personality

Rachel is more emotionally expressive and openly protective than Ben, serving as the "good cop" to his analytical "bad cop" in parenting. Her reactions to Sam's injuries are visceral and immediate. She enjoys wine (with a recurring pattern of overindulging at family dinners), claims to be "still thirty-five," and enjoys reading genre fiction.

Beneath the warmth, Rachel possesses a pragmatic streak and strategic mind that emerge decisively when her family is threatened. Rather than futilely opposing Sam's vigilante activities, she works to establish boundaries that manage risk - installing motion sensors on Sam's windows not to prevent her from leaving, but to know when she does. When Richardson threatened her workplace, Rachel channeled her anger into founding a political movement, motivated by civil liberties and spite in roughly equal measure.

Rachel carries deep trauma from her childhood with Victor Blanc. Her fear that Sam might inherit Victor's antisocial tendencies informs much of her protective behavior and shapes how she parents a daughter with violent capabilities. When Sam confesses to permanently disabling Aaron McKinley's arm (Interlude RS.2), Rachel internally connects Sam's capacity for violence to Victor, wondering if the cycle can be broken.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Samantha "Sam" Small | Daughter | Deeply protective but increasingly pragmatic. Provides research support, political cover, and investigative assistance. |
| Benjamin "Ben" Small | Husband | Partners in parenting; Rachel is the emotional counterbalance to Ben's analytical approach. Met at Drexel University. |
| Morris "Pop-pop Moe" Small | Father-in-law | Cordial relationship. Moe often mediates household tensions and provides wisdom. |
| Camilla de Leon | Mother | Extremely tense relationship rooted in a turbulent upbringing. Despite the friction, Camilla supported Rachel's anti-Richardson testimony and attended the first coalition meeting (Arc 12). |
| Victor Blanc | Father (estranged) | Completely cut out after his abuse and abandonment. His unexpected arrival in Arc 13 triggered profound terror. Last prior contact was at Rachel's wedding. |
| David de Leon | Brother | Unknown to Sam until Arc 13. Referenced during coalition work in Arc 16. |
| Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Adversary | Richardson's workplace threats backfired - Rachel retaliated by founding a coalition, embarrassing Richardson at her own town hall, and testifying to defeat SB-147. |
| Director Iris Hayes | Supervisor | Rachel's library boss. Sycophantic toward Richardson during her surprise visit. |
| Jordan Westwood (Safeguard) | Daughter's friend | Welcomed Jordan warmly into the family home. Uses "community service" as coded language for superhero activities. |
| Nina de la Cruz | Coalition contact | Rachel contacts Nina as genuine outreach, committing to help her exit the Crescent nightclub regardless of investigation value (Arc 14). |
| Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) | Daughter's friend | Initially friendly with Eileen O'Brien; the relationship soured when Sam and Maggie were arrested and the O'Briens blamed Sam (Arc 10). |
| Liam Smith | Kate's father | Bonded over the impossibility of raising powered children. Rachel and Ben offered financial help for the Smiths' relocation (Arc 11). |
| Mrs. Keller | Library colleague | Warned Rachel about Richardson's surprise library visit. |

    **Role:** Supporting

    Mentioned in Chapter 1 as co-signing Sam's JLUMA with parental consent. First appears on-page in Chapter 2 during the family drive to Pop-pop Moe's house in Ventnor for Shabbat dinner. Described as a librarian with tan skin, freckled cheeks, and wavy lighter brown hair. Gets quite drunk on wine and falls asleep on Moe's couch, then in the car on the drive home.

Present in Chapter 4 when Liberty Belle visits the Small home to recruit Sam for the Young Defenders. Makes proper tea with the kettle for the first time Sam can remember (she usually microwaves water), raises practical concerns about insurance, scheduling, risk assessment, pay, and college applications. During the summer montage (Ch. 9), takes Sam Target shopping for school supplies and buys her a first aid kit - not for Sam's own injuries, but "in case someone gets hurt at school and you're the one to help them." In Chapter 14, arrives at the hospital after Sam's injuries from the Kingdom fight - heels clicking on hospital tiles, emotional but controlled. Lays out a practical plan: stay with the Young Defenders for training and patrol, but no more freelance dangerous investigations, leaving that to adults with gear, backup, and bulletproof vests.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appears during the Rosh Hashanah family gathering at Pop-Pop Moe's in Ventnor (Ch. 16), on her third glass of wine and gently swaying.

In Chapter 27, Jordan visits the Small home for the first time; Rachel bakes cookies (extra chocolate for Sam), uses "community service" as coded language for superhero activities, and claims to be "still thirty-five." When the Kingdom's mutant animal hybrids attack the home in Chapter 27, Rachel screams from downstairs. In Chapter 28, she fends off an opossum-copperhead hybrid with a broom - Jordan uses spatial manipulation to fix the space under her feet so her wild swing actually connects. Calls 911: "What do you FUCKING mean, fifteen FUCKING minutes?" Tells Sam and Jordan "We love you" before evacuating with Ben to Pop-pop Moe's house. In Chapter 29, Ben confirms the family is safe in New Jersey, and he cries with Rachel and Sam over the phone.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Minor

    Sam is living with the Chen family in Bridesburg during this arc while the Small home is rebuilt. Rachel sends reminders about math homework even from a distance (Ch. 31). Appears via video call during Thanksgiving at the Chen household (Ch. 42), her face lighting up with "Sammy!" - a mix of gratitude and curiosity. Asks about school and life, carefully dancing around superhero topics. Tells Sam: "We're proud of you. You're doing incredible things." The family is living with Pop-Pop Moe in Ventnor while the house is repaired.

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital during Sam's recovery from radiation exposure. In Chapter 62 (epistolary chapter), a nurse notes that Sam's hair is falling out and Rachel "just started crying." Rachel is described as "pill-positive" regarding psychiatric medication, in contrast to Ben's skepticism - Sam overheard "intense conversations" about medication growing up. During a family visit (Ch. 63), Rachel brushes Sam's head where hair used to be with a touch that is "light, afraid." Tells Sam: "We've come to understand that we can't stop you from doing what you think is right. We just want you to be safe." Rachel has been working at a Ventnor library while the family lives with Pop-Pop Moe. Reveals her bipolar disorder directly to Jordan during a bedside conversation: "No, but I do, Jordan. When I was Sam's age I also used to do a lot of risky things. I just didn't have superpowers." In Chapter 65, Camilla de Leon storms into the hospital room and Rachel tries to stop her, shouting: "She's my granddaughter too, Rachel! You can't just keep me from her!" Rachel warns Camilla: "If you touch a hair on her body, or G-d forbid, bring HIM up, I will hunt for a restraining order." Camilla is described as having the same stormy orange-brown eyes as Rachel. Present for Sam's 15th birthday celebration (Ch. 68), where her relief is visible - hands fluttering, shiny eyes. Sam is started on lithium for a bipolar diagnosis and Rachel's face becomes "a mask of worry and denial when the doctors suggested Bipolar. A sort of smothered horror."

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appears in Chapter 69 during the family's return to their newly rebuilt home. Makes slow-cooker brisket for a family dinner. Comments on Sam's return to school: "Surviving a supervillain attack? That's one for the history books" - to which Sam protests "they don't know that!" In Chapter 71, Rachel leads the Passover Seder. Guests include Pop-Pop Moe, Ben, Sam, Jamila Fayad, and Abigail Silverman. Camilla is not present but Sam has had "clandestine meetings" with her - Camilla was in the passenger seat when Rachel picked Sam up from physical therapy. During the Seder, Rachel sings soprano during Kiddush. When Sam asks for wine since she's now fifteen, Rachel flatly refuses: "Absolutely not." When Sam slips and reveals her powers don't let alcohol affect her, Rachel catches it immediately: "And just HOW, exactly, would you know that, Samantha?" Rachel also reveals that the city provides security for the neighborhood - a police officer stationed in an empty house nearby.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Supporting

    During the summer montage (Ch. 86), Rachel's challah baking has become a running joke - her attempts are compared to a "sandworm from Beetlejuice" and "Baby Yoda choking on a frog." Makes "power pancakes" with protein powder and superfoods for Sam before the Fedorov deposition. Coaches Sam alongside Ben over dinner, advising her to "be completely honest" (Ch. 86). Shares a personal anecdote from her time as a young librarian at the University City branch circa 2001: a Korean bookseller outside the library was picked up by INS (undocumented immigrant), Rachel called the INS agent and "gave that racist prick a piece of my mind," a process server came with a subpoena, and Rachel claims she "punched him square in the nose" (or possibly "flashed the guy" - she's deliberately unclear). She got the agent reassigned. Ben uses her full name - Rachel Esther Small - during this scene. Rachel also coaches Sam before the deposition morning: "Stay strong, stay honest, and let that Gibson lady handle the rest." In Chapter 87, Rachel is present during the legal prep montage with Gibson and Caldwell. After Jamila breaks up with Sam (Ch. 89), Sam snaps at Rachel: "Leave me alone!" - though she recognizes she is being unreasonable. Present during Sam's multi-week recovery from the courthouse attack (Ch. 100), where Mom and Dad take turns staying with Sam. Rachel shares library gossip about Mrs. Goldstein during hospital visits.

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    In Chapter 102, Rachel and Ben are called to Principal Heckerman's office after Sam intervenes to protect freshman James Jackson from security officer Lewis Ridley's assault. Samantha's full name is used: "Samantha Elisabeth Small." After seeing Jordan's video evidence of Ridley's actual behavior, Rachel goes "FULL FURY" with what Sam describes as "unfiltered Spanish fury" - threatening to contact the student's parents, put them in touch with a lawyer, involve the teachers' union, and mentioning Mayor Watkins and the "little martial law stunt" that shut down her library. Heckerman downgrades Sam's punishment from expulsion to one week detention. In Chapter 107, Rachel appears in "librarian mode," drinking Dr. Pepper while the family watches the Fedorov sentencing. At the Rosh Hashanah dinner at Pop-Pop Moe's house in Ventnor (Ch. 108), Rachel is eyeing wine with "too much interest" from the start. By the time political arguments erupt, she is slurring and passionately denouncing martial law's effect on her library, revealing she was pulled over for "suspicious behavior" while dropping off library books. Dad stays behind to tend to Rachel after the dinner falls apart. On Homecoming night (Ch. 111), Mom sees Sam in her suit and tears up: "You look so grown up" - straightens Sam's collar with visible emotion. Quizzes Sam on congressional protocols and procedure using her librarian skills before the D.C. testimony (Ch. 113). After Sam's testimony, Mom is crying when they embrace at the loading dock. The family takes the train back to Philadelphia from Union Station.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    In Chapter 119, Rachel recognizes Maya Richardson on the news from the Kingdom attack on their home: "Isn't that the woman who was with that awful T-Rex man last winter? The one who destroyed our house just before Hanukkah?" Suggests talking to the DVDs and Councilman Davis to "rope in some of the adults." Mrs. O'Brien is seen chatting with Rachel on the front stoop "like they're old friends" when Sam and Maggie return from their first patrol.

    Interlude RS.1 is the first chapter told from Rachel's perspective. She hosts Moe for dinner at the newly reconstructed Small home with wine and snacks. The living room still smells like fresh paint and new carpet despite months of scented candles. They discuss work and recent events, with Rachel vaguely mentioning "some villain spouting nonsense about evil dolphins or something" at the zoo. Moe shares a story about working on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge as a metaphor for parenting - how his co-worker Jimmy said "sometimes you gotta know when to push and when to let things settle on their own." Rachel expresses escalating fears about Sam's dangerous activities: "She's almost sixteen. She should be worrying about prom dates and college applications." Sam texts that she's on her way home with Maggie, prompting a conversation about whether Sam has a crush on Maggie and past issues with Jamila. Rachel thinks about the distance growing between her and Sam, remembering the daughter who used to curl up next to her on the couch and read for hours. The interlude ends with the parents bonding over the impossibility of raising these particular children.

    In Chapter 126, after Sam's zoo encounter with Dr. Xenograft, Rachel offers grounding advice: "You can't save everyone. You can't fix everything. And trying to will only burn you out." Makes Sam a sandwich with pickles.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Major (Interlude)

    Rachel now works at the Northeast Regional Library, having transferred from the Tacony Library. During Shabbat dinner (Ch. 136), she drinks grape juice instead of wine: "Just trying it out. Could be a phase." Responds to the family discussion about Mrs. Xenograft's frog-hybrid creatures with dry humor: "Frogs combined with who knows what else, roaming around the city? Wonderful." During Aaron McKinley's escalating arson campaign, Rachel is concerned but Sam lies about staying safe (Ch. 141). When Sam subtly warns the family to go to Ventnor (Ch. 144), Rachel understands the unspoken danger and goes without being told explicitly. After Sam is set on fire at school, Rachel panics over the phone from Pop-Pop Moe's in Ventnor: "Your ARM is burned!" (Ch. 145).

    Narrates Interlude RS.2, set the morning after Aaron McKinley's arrest. Rachel organizes a healing trip to Kalahari water park in the Poconos with the Smalls, Kate's father Liam Smith, and Sam's friends (Maggie, Jordan, Tasha, and Kate). At the kitchen table, Liam deals with insurance paperwork - payout frozen pending determination of whether the fire was a "supervillain attack" or "ordinary arson." Rachel watches Sam's stiffness and the mosaic of scars and burns across her body in the harsh locker room light, resisting the urge to fuss. During the trip, Sam pulls Rachel aside and confesses that she permanently disabled Aaron's arm after he was already cornered - he'll never use it the same way again. Sam struggles with the satisfaction she felt and the guilt that followed: "It felt satisfying in this gross, animal way. Like what a cat probably feels when they catch a bird." Rachel internally connects Sam's capacity for violence to Victor Blanc, thinking about whether someone stopping Victor earlier would have spared Rachel, or whether it would just have been another act of violence in a long, endless chain. She tells Sam: "You're not him... You're not the kind of person who hurts people just because you can." The interlude ends with Liam and Rachel commiserating in the food court over the impossibility of raising these particular children.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Drives Sam and Kate to therapy sessions together - Sam for physical therapy, Kate seeing Dr. Alvarez (Ch. 150). Present during Sam's 16th birthday celebration (Ch. 154). Part of the 3 AM parental confrontation after Sam and Maggie are arrested (Ch. 155) - the O'Brien parents (Sean and Eileen) blame Sam's influence on Maggie, and both families impose grounding. Referenced during the period of escalating anti-vigilante sentiment as SARA passes and the Young Defenders are dissolved. Present during family scenes at home as Sam monitors the Stheno investigation.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present when Sam confesses to the warehouse raid; participates in establishing new ground rules with Ben - school first, mandatory check-ins, grounded for the month (Ch. 165). Agrees to the Chambers & Woo consultation with conditions: she and Ben must accompany Sam and the meeting is framed as a consultation with all findings shared (Ch. 167). Present at the Diamond Street meeting with Akilah and Devonte about the encrypted Kingdom data (Ch. 168). Offers financial help for Kate and Liam Smith's relocation to Center City after Soot's staged death (Ch. 175).

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Major

    Central figure in multiple storylines. In Interlude RS.3, Mrs. Keller informs Rachel that Councilwoman Richardson has arrived for a "surprise visit" at the South Branch Library during Summer Reading Club. Director Hayes (Iris Hayes), sycophantic toward Richardson, introduces her and praises Rachel's Summer Reading Program, then leaves them alone. Richardson delivers thinly veiled threats: "Municipal jobs are precious in this economy. Budget cuts happen. Programs get eliminated." Rachel confronts her directly: "Are you threatening me, Councilwoman?" When Richardson says "I'm not a mother, Mrs. Small," Rachel replies: "Could've fooled me" - implying Richardson looks old enough to be a mother. Rachel stands firm: "You should know that threatening my child is going to have the opposite effect." Later at Friday Shabbos dinner, she finds Ben making challah, Moe's brisket, and her mother Camilla visiting unexpectedly. Moe subtly steers Camilla away so Rachel can tell Ben about Richardson's visit privately. Ben calls it blackmail; Rachel notes Richardson was too smart to threaten explicitly. Rachel decides to testify at the Harrisburg hearings, motivated partly by civil liberties and partly spite: "Fine, thirty percent spite." Camilla supports the decision: "Show them what de Leon women are made of."

    Rachel insists Sam rest and plans to use the Rush Order shooting in her testimony after arriving at Jefferson Hospital when Ben is shot. In Interlude RS/DC/JF (six days after Ben is shot), Rachel organizes a parents' support group at the South Philly Public Library community room, where fourteen parents/guardians attend. Stories include: a telekinetic son (the Millers, car accident), a plant-manipulating daughter (single father), complementary-powered twins (heat/cold), and a wall-seeing grandson (grandmother). Camilla attends, sitting in the back. Rachel establishes regular meetings with a secure messaging group. Over coffee with Camilla, she discusses the motion sensors she installed on Sam's windows and the NRA sending flowers to Ben. The "cocaine Rachel" past and Camilla's "boyfriend carousel" are referenced during this conversation. News breaks that gun sales have spiked 300% following the "Gun Dad" incident.

    At Richardson's town hall (Ch. 191), Rachel stands up: "My name is Rachel Small... my husband is the man you're holding up as exemplar." Announces Ben opposes the legislation. Parents of powered teens stand throughout the audience with signs: "PROTECT POWERED YOUTH," "SUPERVISION NOT CRIMINALIZATION," "MY CHILD IS NOT A WEAPON." ParentsOfPoweredKids.co.us launches and gains 20,000 signatures in hours, with dozens of local chapters across Pennsylvania. Sam later realizes Rachel PLANNED for Sam to show up at the town hall - the motion sensors were designed so Rachel would know when Sam left, and she had the coalition ready. Rachel's punishment: library volunteering five days a week (four-hour shifts under Rachel's supervision), physical therapy assistance for Ben twice weekly, tracker at all times, and Sam must tell parents when going out as Bloodhound. Rachel tells Sam: "Next time you decide to do something monumentally reckless... talk to me first. We might be able to coordinate our recklessness." Coalition spreads to NJ, NY, and MD.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Major

    Announces she's taking Sam to Harrisburg for the state senate hearings on September 8th (Ch. 196). During the drive, the coalition has 2,000+ subscribers. In Chapter 197, Sam and Rachel help injured people in a hotel lobby using Sam's blood sense after the Boston explosion (a concussive energy discharge from someone who Activated while being kettled by police). Rachel's powerful final testimony before the committee helps defeat SB-147 by a vote of 11-9 in committee.

    On the drive home (Ch. 198), Rachel panics at the sight of a big rig cab parked on their street - it belongs to Victor Blanc. During Victor's visit (Ch. 199), he methodically examines Sam's hands, notes scars between fingers, and asks if she hesitates before hitting people. Victor reveals he hit Rachel: "never when she made a mistake, you never need more than one blow." Rachel steps in and orders him to leave when Sam impulsively punches Victor. Rachel collapses emotionally after he leaves and calls in sick to work for the first time in years. She explicitly forbids Sam from contacting Victor. Ben reveals that Victor was "different" before the stroke - more engaged when Rachel was young, something changed around age 6-7. Rachel says Sam "might be autistic, and that's fine" but is "not a sociopath."

    Sam gives Victor's sealed letter to Rachel (Ch. 201), claiming it was in the mailbox. Rachel and Ben reveal they KNOW Sam visited Victor because the tracker showed her location. Victor's letter confirms someone arranged his visit to cause family disruption. Sam later identifies the birds being killed across the neighborhood as the work of Shrike (Niles Nolan) and informs parents; Rachel calls police with the identification (Ch. 201). During the Shrike crisis, Rachel and Ben arrive at the scene where Sam rescues hostage Mack Gallagher from a dumpster (Ch. 203) - Rachel does first aid while Ben gets supplies from a convenience store. Introduces Sam to the Morrison Collection at the library, teaching her the digitization process and explaining the importance of metadata.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Major

    Demonstrates crisis management skills during the 3:42 AM emergency evacuation after Shrike's bedroom invasion (Ch. 204). Drives the family to the Music Hall (Auditors HQ) with emotions packed away in pure crisis mode. Parents see the base for the first time. Rachel establishes as non-negotiable that she must be present for any Rogue Wave contact. During the Rogue Wave negotiation (Ch. 205), Rachel catches Monkey Business on juvenile contract voidability - minors can void contracts at 18, which is why Monkey Business doesn't want to use his binding power. Rush Order comments: "Hot mom, Bloodhound." Rachel insists on maintaining normalcy with schoolwork even during the crisis, making Sam email teachers for assignments and do Spanish homework.

    Catches Sam with cigarettes: "SAMANTHA ELISABETH SMALL!" Compromises on smoking (Ch. 206): one cigarette allowed, only when Rachel is present. Reveals that Sam's maternal grandmother "Mom-Mom Leah" died of lung cancer from smoking, and raises the concern that regeneration might make cancer worse, citing how Liberty Belle's cancer was worsened by her powers. Schools in NE Philly close due to Shrike's attacks; dead animals are also found at Drexel University (where Rachel and Ben went to school).

    After Shrike's death, Rachel stays at the hospital for 24 hours straight until Tasha convinces her to sleep at a hotel. New family rules (Ch. 210): GPS tracker stays active at all times, must inform parents before patrols, parents have veto power, no bail if arrested under new anti-vigilante laws. Rachel: "We're not negotiating." When Sam says she doesn't want to be Bloodhound anymore, Rachel cries - from relief, not sadness. Participates in family therapy sessions with Dr. Kaplan (Ch. 213), fourth session. Rachel discusses hypervigilance since the home invasion. Pushes back on Ben's gun: "A gun in the house is more likely to hurt us than protect us." The session explores generational trauma - Ben's gun history tracing back through Pop-pop Moe, whose mother survived the Shoah.

    Contacts Nina de la Cruz through Dr. Jensen as genuine outreach (Ch. 216). Sam presents a persuasive argument for why the Smalls should be involved; Rachel challenges her to make the case. On Thursday, Nina visits the Small house - 24 years old, blue hair, undercut, piercings, electrical powers. Rachel pitches the mentorship program. After Sam excuses herself (secretly listening via phone from upstairs), Nina opens up about the Crescent nightclub, seeing Richardson and Silverstein going upstairs, being financially trapped supporting her younger sister. Rachel offers the program's job placement help and Davis's connections. After Nina leaves, Rachel commits: "I said I'd help her, and by G-d, I will help her even if they send two T-Rexes and the Mayor of Philadelphia after me." Arrives at the hospital and pulls Sam into a tight hug after the Garbage Day attack that dislocates Tasha's shoulder (Ch. 218).

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    After Sam flees Patriot and Turbo Jett's arrest attempt, Rachel is furious: "Let go of her. Right now" in a dangerous voice with the "scowl of a gorilla." Her expression "makes her eyebrows look like Victor's." She has her phone with tracker data ready. Pulls up tracker data when Jett asks to see it. Makes eye contact with Sam and nods - psychic communication to "Go. We'll handle this." Rachel and Ben hire Gerald "Jerry" Caldwell (Chernobyl's former lawyer) to represent Sam. Her voicemail to Sam: they have retained legal counsel, have tracker data, timestamped photos, and school attendance records. "We love you. We're furious, but not at you."

    Offers the Small family home as the new Auditors meeting space and war room after the Music Hall is damaged, providing replacement computers for Sam and Tasha. Tells Sundial: "Anything you need to say in front of Sam, you can say in front of us. We're up to speed." During the blizzard, Rachel describes what's happening as an "apocalypse" in the original sense: "A biblical apocalypse. An unveiling, not the end of the world. The chips start going down, and you get to see where all the fault lines are." Makes dinner (penne with marinara and Italian sausage, later meatloaf with ketchup glaze) and ensures Maxwell Martinez has everything he needs during his recovery at their home: blankets, water, pain meds. Tells him: "Call me Rachel." During the parent confrontation after Alex Kirby's unauthorized warehouse operation, Rachel asks the direct questions: "Did you two plan this together?" and "You still got shot - and you had access to a bulletproof vest." Coalition coordinates with NY and Boston groups regarding Richardson legislation being proposed in three more states. Nina is training for the administrative position Rachel's contact set up - should quit the Crescent by end of January. Mom texts every hour during mentorship meetings. Sam discusses The Crucible in English class and notes that Rachel "has strong opinions about Arthur Miller."

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Comes home to find Sam crying after the Songbird bounty hunter attack (Ch. 237). In Chapter 242, Sam comes home with a bruised face and tells her parents everything immediately - including that she is Megalodon. Dad had already figured it out (Mr. Donovan was asking around). Rachel delivers the "Watching History Syndrome" speech: describing the experience of watching your kid and knowing they are going to be in a history book one day, being scared anyway. Rachel tells Sam: "You're a remarkably well-adjusted teenager with superpowers. That's not a compliment." Her acceptance of Megalodon is framed not as permission but as acknowledgment that the terms of the situation have been accepted by all parties. Dad offers to get updated sewer maps: "If she's going to do this, she should have accurate maps." Rachel has been talking to Uncle David and other parents of powered kids - mentions three parents with kids at Aurora Springs, one in the hospital, one who was in Daedalus. For Sam's first patrol as Megalodon, parents negotiate terms: planned route, home by ten, text updates. Mom: "Home by ten" - functional family negotiation with no tears or ultimatums. Rachel attends synagogue with Sam, where the rabbi's sermon references Nachshon - walking into the water before the miracle. Continues coalition work, mentioned on the phone with coalition references to someone named "Gilly" and working with a state legislator. The coalition is listed among the many independent threads making Maya Richardson's position untenable. Maxwell Martinez departs Sunday morning after approximately three months recovering on the Smalls' couch. Rachel's coalition issues a polite statement when Richardson resigns, wishing her well.


## Trivia

- She microwaves water for tea as her typical method, but unusually used a kettle when Liberty Belle visited - the first time Sam can remember her using it.
