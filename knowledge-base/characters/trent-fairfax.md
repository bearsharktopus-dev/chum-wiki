## Background

Trent Fairfax was born in Philadelphia to a single mother, Emily Caldwell, who worked two jobs to cover his doctors, medication, and specialized schooling. Diagnosed with severe OCD in childhood, he developed coping strategies with therapist Dr. Hendricks and was placed on SSRIs that he credited with preventing "uncontrollable, alien thoughts" from overwhelming him. Assessed as intellectually gifted, he cultivated strategic invisibility through school - eating lunch in the library, maintaining strict routines, keeping his differences hidden.

Fairfax attended Columbia Law School, where he excelled under the Socratic method and specialized in criminal law. His metahuman abilities manifested during a traumatic assault by four powered criminals - Cryobrand, Firebrand, Rebrand, and Storebrand - who cornered him in an alley after a 1L celebration at McGinty's bar. After graduating, he explored his powers in secret and founded the Kingdom of Keys, inspired by a lifetime spent cataloguing the structural failures of fictional villains (from comic books through _The Sopranos_) and the real-world opportunity created by the Big Raid.

His public identity is carefully maintained as the unremarkable lesser scion of a Tremont & Fairfax partner - a freewheeling financial investor too inconsequential to attract attention. His actual role as the Kingdom's leader is known only to his inner circle; most subordinates know him only as "Upper Management" or "Mr. A." He also operates through a secondary front, Alcott & Associates, used for philanthropy, legal casework, and prison visits under attorney-client privilege. Fairfax privately funded the William J. Hofmann Memorial Recovery Ward at Jefferson Hospital, treating survivors of the Phreaks' courthouse attack - motivated by personal guilt, as Maya Richardson, operating under his authority, had brought Deathgirl into the Kingdom's orbit. He characterized this not as altruism but as recognizing that "a safe world is a profitable world."

## Powers & Abilities

!!! danger "REDACTED"
    Mr. Antithesis's powers have not yet been revealed in the published story. This section will be updated when his abilities are disclosed in-text.

### Training & Skills

- Licensed attorney (Columbia Law, criminal law specialty) who maintains his credentials and occasionally takes cases. His legal knowledge grants direct access to incarcerated individuals under attorney-client privilege.
- Lifelong analytical thinker who catalogued structural failures in fictional villains from childhood, then formalized his strategic reasoning through legal education.
- Treats criminal operations as business ventures, emphasizing financial return and sustainable institutional design over ideology or personality-driven leadership.
- Avid chess player, accomplished cook, and well-read with a particular interest in ancient mythology.
- Carries personal self-defense equipment (mace and taser) as a matter of practical habit.

## Personality

Trent Fairfax is obsessively clean and precise, with frequent use of hand sanitizer and a habit of destroying stress balls. He speaks with businesslike detachment, viewing crime as a purely financial enterprise. His OCD manifests in strict routines, need for symmetry and order, and intense agitation when his environment is disrupted - managed but never fully resolved through medication and behavioral systems. The persistent "tightness in his chest" has been a lifelong companion. He maintains a sterile Manhattan office and conducts meetings with cold, clinical efficiency.

Fairfax possesses deep, intellectualized self-awareness about his condition that borders on clinical detachment from his own psychology. He processes emotions analytically rather than experientially, describing feelings as "painted in a magic color" - bright yellow for noticing, hazard, and fear. Despite this emotional flatness, he is capable of dry situational humor - when cornered by powered criminals, he told them they would make "excellent clients one day." He does not drink alcohol.

Beneath the control, he is capable of rare but intense emotional reactions - after being coerced into the Daedalus operation by Porcelain, he destroyed his own office before composing himself. He does not take personal interest in low-level threats, delegating problems like Sam to subordinates, and views interactions with adversaries as simple business transactions.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Subordinate / Philadelphia branch leader | Formerly managed the Philadelphia operation under his authority. After her arrest, performs controlled cooperation with federal authorities - feeding expendable assets while protecting structural elements. Trent considers her political infrastructure (council seat, Argus Corps oversight) an acceptable loss that removes exposure threads. |
| Mrs. Blue Velvet (Ophelia Grady) | Subordinate / Second-in-command | His consigliere, appointed despite lacking managerial experience. Has developed an intense, borderline-obsessive attachment to him. Accompanies him to Jefferson Hospital ward visits as "Ms. Grady." Knows when not to ask questions, a trait he explicitly appreciates. |
| Mr. ESP (Wesley) | Subordinate / Boston branch leader | Oversees Kingdom operations in Boston. Coordinates with Fairfax on personnel logistics. |
| Porcelain | External threat / Coercer | Leader of Red Calf, described as the strongest superhuman on Earth. Coerced the Kingdom into the Daedalus prison break under threat of exposing Richardson's Kingdom ties. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary | Met her once in his Manhattan office during a business transaction. Initially delegated to Maya; after the Polygraph incident, assessed her as "sophisticated for a sixteen-year-old" and ordered a 72-hour response plan. Sam described him as "a child." |
| Mr. Retribution | Subordinate / Enforcer | Boston-based, deployed for high-priority tasks. Accompanied Sam to and from the Fairfax meeting. |
| Mrs. Quiet | Subordinate / Investigator | Serves as driver and handler for sensitive operations involving Fairfax's interests. |
| Blake Matthews (Mr. Tyrannosaur) | Subordinate / Enforcer | Receives operational briefings from Fairfax. |
| Dr. Trinh-Norwood (Mrs. Xenograft) | Subordinate / Scientist | Reports to Fairfax on drug development. He rewarded her Hypeman innovation with a raise but warned future failures would not be tolerated. |
| Lucas Donovan (Mr. Preclude) | Subordinate / Founding member | After depowering by Rogue Wave, Fairfax stripped his Polygraph codename but maintained salary and authority. Later re-powered through Fly with "Preclusion" (making rules), renamed Mr. Preclude, and assigned as Mr. Nothing's second-in-command in Philadelphia. |
| Emily Caldwell | Mother | Single mother who worked two jobs. Adapted to his sensory needs - hugging briefly, with warning, not too tight. Cried when he was accepted to Columbia. |
| Dr. Hendricks | Childhood Therapist | Practiced downtown (23 minutes by bus). Taught Trent to recognize and redirect catastrophizing. Referred him to Dr. Ndiaye for New York. |
| Dr. Ndiaye | Law School Psychiatrist | Brooklyn-based, sessions by phone. Cautioned Trent against optimizing experiences rather than living them - a distinction he acknowledged intellectually but could not meaningfully apply. |
| Sarah Fairfax | Wife | Originally in Trent's 1L study group at Columbia. Instigated his attending the McGinty's bar celebration. Registered firearms-trained. They live together in Connecticut. Trent loves her deeply and thinks fondly of their first time at the shooting range together. |
| Marcus Whitmore | Ward Patient | A Phreaks courthouse attack survivor reduced to undifferentiated tissue by bad Jump, reconstructed over two years by metahuman healers. Fairfax visits him regularly. Whitmore asked about "the people behind the people behind the people" - a question Fairfax could not safely answer. |
| Aaron McKinley (Mr. Prometheus) | Subordinate / Recruit | Incarcerated pyrogenetic recruited at Curran-Fromhold under attorney-client privilege. Fairfax offered Kingdom membership, a synergistic Fly dose, a six-month jailbreak timeline, a mission to kill Sam Small, and a fiefdom in Camden. |

## Arc Appearances

Attendees include Mrs. Zenith, Mrs. Blue Velvet, Mr. ESP, Mr. Keys, and Mr. Yellowjacket. Does not appear in person.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Supporting (Interlude LTN.2)

    Meets with Mrs. Xenograft in his sterile Manhattan skyscraper office following the failed zoo heist (Operation Ivory). Receives her presentation of Hypeman (Compound J-237) and accepts her explanation for the failure. Rewards her with a raise and share of Hypeman's profits but warns that future failures will not be tolerated. Scylla is deliberately left outside his office, implying his power's disruptive effect on superpowered creations.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Supporting (Chapters 173-174)

    First in-person appearance. Sam Small is brought to his Manhattan office by Mr. Retribution and Mrs. Quiet for a negotiated meeting. Fairfax interrogates Sam about Kate Smith/Soot's identity, treating the exchange as a business transaction. Provides Sam with two Hypeman autoinjectors in exchange for information. Rebuffs Sam's attempt to gain intelligence about Tremont & Fairfax. Notes Sam is only spared because her powers lack significant collateral damage. Sam privately describes him to Retribution as "a child."

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Supporting (Interludes MR.8, BM.3)

    In Interlude MR.8, meets privately with Porcelain of Red Calf for 43 minutes while Richardson waits outside beyond the 50-foot range. Porcelain coerces the Kingdom into extracting Deathgirl from Daedalus under threat of exposing Richardson's Kingdom ties. After requesting 20 minutes before seeing Richardson, Fairfax destroys his own office in a rage - crystal paperweight shattered, bookshelves emptied, hand sanitizer spilled - emerging with raw knuckles and red eyes from crying. He admits, "I don't handle anger well." Outlines the operation parameters for September 10th. In Interlude BM.3, briefs operatives via video call at Bella Notte restaurant in Staten Island on the Daedalus prison break, revealing Porcelain as contractor and presenting schematics. First time showing his face on video to subordinates, noted as highly unusual. States collateral escapes are explicitly not the Kingdom's concern per Porcelain's requirements.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting (Interlude MR.9)

    Personally attends a late-night debrief at a Port Richmond warehouse after Polygraph is captured and depowered by Rogue Wave - unprecedented given his usual remoteness. Arrives in a nondescript sedan at 11:50 PM. Maintains at least 15 feet from Mr. Nothing due to their powers' dangerous interaction. Announces Polygraph will lose his codename but retain salary, territory, and authority, as the alphabetized system requires demonstrated superhuman capability. Pledges to personally coordinate Fly acquisition to restore Polygraph's powers. Gives Maya 72 hours for a comprehensive response plan against Bloodhound, advising her to sleep on it first. Maya's resulting plan includes the frame-up operation against Sam using Mrs. Doppelganger.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude TF.3 - Arc Finale)

    Reorganizes the Kingdom of Keys after Maya Richardson's arrest and controlled cooperation with federal authorities. Elevates Mr. Keys to primary advisory role and places Mr. Nothing in operational command of Philadelphia. Lucas Donovan, re-powered through Fly with a new ability called "Preclusion" (making rules), is renamed Mr. Preclude and assigned as Nothing's second-in-command. Receives Chezki Espinosa, who brings Dr. Euphemia "Effie" Dunham - a brilliant but chaotic stem cell and chimera researcher - to be inducted as Mrs. Zygote under Mrs. Xenograft's supervision.

    Explains to subordinates why threatening Maya's daughter Roxanne would be counterproductive, turning a managed asset into a desperate liability. Assesses the fallout: the Bellwether site is gone (16 detained, equipment seized, Marathon's explosives found), and Maya's political infrastructure - her council seat and Argus Corps oversight role - is severed. Considers this acceptable, as it removes exposure threads. Reframes Philadelphia as "a revenue center, not a political project." Has a security detail watching Daisy Zhen's parents (Wei and Xiuying Zhen) in Chicago. Ophelia Grady works in the lobby. Lucas endures an extended conversation with Effie in the waiting room. Trent heads home to wife Sarah in Connecticut.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up (TF.1)"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude)

    Extended first-person flashback covering Fairfax's life from age nine through law school. Opens with nine-year-old Trent purchasing _The Amazing Spider-Man_ #252 at a comic shop (held it for eleven minutes checking for damage, bought it for $1.25) while his mother waits outside. Depicts his childhood OCD management with Dr. Hendricks - compulsive counting (67 steps from lobby to apartment door), catastrophizing, the persistent chest tightness. His family lived in a fourth-floor apartment in a declining building; the elevator worked most days. By the time he left for Columbia, he owned 847 comics in seven long boxes, organized by title and issue number in plastic sleeves with cardboard backings.

    Covers his acceptance to Columbia (mother's happy tears, four-hour-twenty-seven-minute bus ride counting mile markers), mastery of the Socratic method under Professor Whitman (earned "adequate" - high praise), transition to psychiatrist Dr. Ndiaye, and his study group (Sarah, Michael, David, Lisa). He lived in a small, clean studio organized precisely to his specifications, ate alone by preference, and characterized relationships as "collegial - functional, adequate." His analytical study of _The Sopranos_ (introduced by a classmate) reinforced his cataloguing of villain failure modes: ego over strategy, personality-driven instability over institutional durability. He described feelings as arriving "painted in a magic color" - bright yellow for noticing, hazard, and fear.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up (TF.2)"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude)

    Continues from TF.1 across three sequences. Opens at McGinty's bar after 1L, where Trent attends the study group celebration but drinks only ginger ale and departs early. Walking home, he overhears Cryobrand, Firebrand, Rebrand, and Storebrand planning a robbery. Rebrand shapeshifts to confront him; Cryobrand restrains him with hydrokinetic bindings, forces water into his sinuses, and orders Firebrand to brand him with heat-touch. Firebrand strikes his chest and abdomen repeatedly. Trent's activation event occurs - nosebleed, steam from Firebrand's heat vaporizing Cryobrand's water - and he breaks free, macing Cryobrand and tasering Firebrand. He told them they would make "excellent clients one day."

    In the second sequence, Trent visits the Jefferson Hospital ward with Ophelia Grady, meeting Marcus Whitmore - reduced to undifferentiated tissue by bad Jump, partially reconstructed through two years of metahuman healing. Whitmore asks about "the people behind the people behind the people." Trent internally acknowledges the chain of causation leads back to his own decisions through Maya and Deathgirl. He rejects the degrees-of-separation defense: responsibility does not evaporate because it passes through intermediaries. The ward's funding brought in metahuman healers, experimental enzyme treatments, and research infrastructure advancing power-induced transformation medicine.

    In the third sequence, Trent visits Aaron McKinley at Curran-Fromhold prison under attorney-client privilege. McKinley's right arm is fully braced from injuries inflicted by Sam Small. Fairfax offers Kingdom membership, a Fly dose synergistic with pyrogenetic powers, a six-month jailbreak timeline, a mission to kill Sam, a fiefdom in Camden, and millions of dollars. Names him "Mr. Prometheus" - emphasizing the need for a distinguished name that could not be confused with "McKinley" over a wire. The case was transferred from Tremont & Fairfax's inferior criminal law division to Alcott & Associates. Internally references Porcelain: "I can learn, too, Mr. Espinosa. My wheels versus your own."

## Trivia

- The Kingdom psych profiles list his name as "Liam Caldwell," born November 13, 1989, while his current canonical name is "Trent Fairfax." This may represent an alias, a retcon, or an in-universe discrepancy.
- The psych profiles note his 26th birthday inspired a pact to build an organization with 26 metahuman members - one for each letter of the alphabet - which became the Kingdom's naming convention.
- The Kingdom's first major heist occurred in Philadelphia in December 2020 according to the psych profile timeline.
- His favorite villain was Kid Miracleman from _Miracleman_, which he considered the gold standard.
- His internal monologue at the hospital includes: "Supervillainy is the most fun a boy can have without joining a hedge fund," and "I hold no illusions about what I am. But I think 99 out of 100 Mr. Antithesises live in a much worse world than I do."
- Interlude TF.2 opens with Pink Floyd's "Money" lyrics and closes with a spoken word excerpt from the same song's outro, framing the interlude's themes of financial power and moral accounting.
- A passerby mistook him and Blue Velvet for a couple; Trent noted her blue-haired aesthetic has value and asked her not to change it.
- Alcott & Associates also operates as Alcott Properties in Boston. The Boston Red Shocks raided Alcott Properties' Seaport offices to copy documents proving collusion with city officials, unknowingly targeting a Kingdom front company.
- His hatred of sweat was a recurring motif, rooted in its association with germs and illness rather than the sensation itself.
