## Background

Alex Kirby is a sixteen-year-old who recently relocated to Philadelphia from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. His parents hold mid-level administrative positions in the Pennsylvania state government - not elected officials, but functionaries with enough standing that City Councilman Jamal Davis knows them professionally. It was this connection, rather than a referral from Dr. Jensen (who flagged the other mentorship candidates), that secured Alex's place in the pilot peer mentorship program spearheaded by Davis after the Shrike crisis.

Alex joined the program in November 2025 and trained alongside Zara Khan, Liam O'Connor, and Jasmine Walker under Sam Small and Maggie O'Brien's guidance, developing increasingly precise fire control over the following months. However, his desire for bold action clashed with the program's emphasis on restraint. He conducted three weeks of unauthorized solo reconnaissance on Kingdom operations, then executed a one-man warehouse raid during the January blizzard (Arc 15), adopting the callsign "Hellhound" and wearing Sam's old Bloodhound mask - warped and melted into something new. He barely survived an encounter with the Kingdom enforcer Garbage Day and was subsequently benched from all solo operations indefinitely.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Pyrokinesis (Torch-Style)** - Vents an anomalous flammable gas mixture from his pores and flash-ignites it on command. Technically classified as pyrogenesis (he makes fire rather than controlling existing fire), though the mechanism is closer to a biological blowtorch than spontaneous fire creation. The gas mixture smells faintly of propane and alcohol, a distinctive signature that can identify his presence at a scene.
- **Thermal Regulation** - Runs naturally hot, described as having a "pilot light under his skin" with tiny gas jets burning off before becoming visible. He can consciously decide to be warm, making him effectively immune to cold weather and capable of acting as a space heater for others during winter mentorship sessions.
- **Variable Flame Control** - Can adjust output through muscle effort across a wide spectrum. Fire color shifts from dull red-orange at low effort (warming, ambient light) through blue-hot at medium intensity (laser-thin jets capable of cutting metal, precision work) to white at full power. Can light a candle from three feet away with a white-hot razor-thin lance.
- **White-Hot Incandescent Beam** - Upper limit: a white-hot beam from all ten fingers, effective as a plasma torch. Sustainable for only 10-20 seconds before he loses consciousness.
- **Flashbang Deployment** - Accumulates flammable gas at a location (typically near a ceiling) and ignites it, creating a blinding white flash with a corona of colors. Repeatable trick.
- **Steam Explosion** - Directs a plasma-torch-intensity flame at snow or water to create a burst of superheated steam, useful as a defensive wall or area-denial tool.

### Limitations

- Baseline human outside of his pyrokinesis - no enhanced durability, regeneration, or physical augmentations.
- Maximum output sustainable for only 10-20 seconds before unconsciousness.
- Fire is insufficient against opponents with high durability (Garbage Day, AK.1).
- Fires produce a distinctive propane-and-alcohol smell that can identify his presence at a scene.
- High-output fire use burns calories rapidly, requiring frequent refueling.

### Training & Skills

- Two years of "kiddie MMA" training prior to the mentorship program.
- Power control training under Sam and Maggie, developing precision fire techniques and de-escalation awareness.
- Genuine aptitude for fieldwork and intelligence gathering (three weeks of solo Kingdom reconnaissance, Arc 15).
- Trained in parkour by Sam beginning in Arc 16 - "don't-die training" focused on escape: drops, wall direction changes, gap reading, and exit route identification. His residual heat leaves steam marks on cold metal surfaces.
- Self-imposed mercy code: "disarm, don't injure" and "you don't become a good guy by doing bad-guy things."

## Personality

Alex is a romantic in the genre sense - he believes in grand gestures, dramatic action, and making a difference through bold moves. He is driven by a hunger for significance that his emotionally unavailable, career-focused parents fail to provide. When asked why he did not call his parents about his raid injuries: "Because they would've fixed it. Made it go away. And I didn't want it fixed. I wanted it to matter." Mrs. Patterson identified the core of his behavior: he acts out not because he wants to break rules, but because he does not know who he is if he is not fighting something - and noted the parallel to Sam herself.

Alex is an interesting counterpoint to Sam's increasing cynicism. Where Sam thinks in systems, leverage, and long games, Alex still believes in the power of a single dramatic act. He is not reckless in the way of someone who does not think; he is reckless in the way of someone who has thought about it and decided the risk is worth the story. On Valentine's Day (Arc 16), he asked Sam out, was turned down gracefully, and accepted after about ten seconds - passing what Sam internally called "the test." His parting observation was pointed: the situation is not a political thriller either, and she could stand to lighten up.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Mentor | Leads the mentorship program; coordinated Alex's warehouse raid remotely. Gave him her old vest and mask, benched him afterward, and later began teaching him parkour. Sam calls him "Kirby" to distinguish him from her friend Alex Garcia. |
| Jamal Davis | Program Facilitator | Enrolled Alex through his professional connection to Alex's parents rather than Dr. Jensen's referral system. |
| Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) | Peer Mentor | Co-runs mentorship sessions with Sam. Would automatically tell Alex "Language" when he swore. |
| Mr. and Mrs. Kirby | Parents | Mid-level state government administrators. Emotionally unavailable and career-focused - sent a taxi instead of coming to pick him up after the Songbird attack. Alex told them his raid injuries were from parkour on icy roofs. |
| Zara Khan | Fellow Mentee | Youngest member of the peer group at thirteen. |
| Liam O'Connor | Fellow Mentee | His brashness described as "good brash" to Alex's romantic brashness. |
| Jasmine Walker | Fellow Mentee | Withdrawn and quiet where Alex is outward and action-oriented. |
| Tasha Reynolds (Lighthouse) | Operational Support | Provided drone overwatch during the warehouse raid and pre-called fire trucks as a safety measure - the trucks forced Garbage Day to retreat, saving Alex's life. |
| Benjamin Small | Associated Adult | Picked Alex up after the warehouse raid at Sam's direction. |
| Garbage Day | Adversary | Kingdom enforcer who nearly killed Alex during the warehouse raid. Retreated only when fire trucks arrived. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Introduced in Chapter 215 as one of four initial mentorship students at the Tacony Music Hall. Arrives last, wearing a Phillies hoodie, confident and easygoing. Recognizes Sam from the Harrisburg senate hearing. During the group's power demonstrations, produces a small flame in his palm - technically pyrogenesis rather than pyrokinesis, as he makes fire but does not fully control its aftermath at this stage. His parents barely notice his practicing at home.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Major

    Attends the first off-site mentorship meeting at Sam's parents' house (Chapter 221), arriving at 11:20 with Maggie. Can now narrow his flame to laser-thin precision. His parents are relieved he is "in a program." Practices powers in the alley behind the house between the rowhouses.

    Trains at Pennypack Park in January (Chapter 222), producing blue-hot sustained flames between his fingers and acting as a space heater for the group during the winter session. Demonstrates precision work by melting specific icicles. Burns calories fast and needs power bars to refuel. Sam begins mentally calling him "Kirby" to distinguish him from her school friend Alex Garcia.

    Reveals three weeks of unauthorized solo reconnaissance on Kingdom operations during the January 14 blizzard crisis (Chapter 229). Had been working independently since hearing about Sam's impersonation by the shapeshifter Alice. Presents a manila folder containing distribution schedules stolen from a dealer's car he broke into at a bar, hand-drawn territory maps, and route times, identifying a building on Torresdale Avenue as a major operation with heavier traffic and security. While walking the neighborhood with Sam, three Kingdom guys outside Mr. Nowak's hardware store begin pressuring them; Alex lights his fingers with fire - orange flame from his thumb, each fingertip lighting up dull red, then flashing to bright white - and the guy retreats. Alex announces his intention to hit the warehouse that night: "I'm not asking permission." Sam agrees to coordinate one operation with the condition that Alex follow instructions exactly, including retreating.

    Executes the warehouse raid in Interlude AK.1. Spends two hours on the rooftop in sixteen inches of snow, running hot enough that his body heat keeps him warm. Wears Sam's old Bloodhound mask (warped and melted into something new) and Sam's old bulletproof vest, which is sized for a fourteen-year-old girl and a little snug on him. Also wears cutproof padding on knees and elbows. Enters through the east side service entrance by melting the padlock and deadbolt. On the ground floor, finds and photographs all fifteen break-ins' stolen goods - cash registers, electronics, and merchandise with store labels still attached, organized with hand-written inventory lists. Upstairs in the records room, photographs filing cabinets, territory maps pinned to a corkboard, and a laptop. Two armed guards discover him - "Refrigerator" (with shoulders like a refrigerator and a pistol) and a lean man (also armed). Gets shot in the chest - the vest catches it but the impact lifts him off his feet and cracks his ribs. Deploys the gas/plasma flashbang trick to blind the guards, then is grazed twice (outer thigh and upper arm). Strips both guns using magazine release and slide lock, scatters the bullets across the floor. Burns the Kingdom records, maps, and corkboard. Garbage Day arrives by taxi. Extended chase through the warehouse, with Garbage Day throwing shelving units like frisbees. Creates a steam wall at full power, charges, and jams a blue-flame knife hand into Garbage Day's abdomen, but is swatted aside. Fire trucks arrive - Tasha (Lighthouse) had called them preemptively - and Garbage Day retreats. Escapes to a 24-hour laundromat on Cottman Avenue, where Benjamin Small picks him up twenty minutes later. Ditches the mask, vest, and padding in a dumpster behind a closed restaurant.

    Debriefed by Sam the next morning at the Small house (Chapter 230). Sam inspects his injuries: massive purple-black bullet bruise across his entire chest the size of a dinner plate with deep tissue damage, a shallow graze on his outer thigh seeping through gauze, a graze on his upper arm, and a swollen shoulder (possibly bruised muscle or fracture). Sam orders ice, ibuprofen, no arm use for a week, and insists on urgent care. Delivers the ultimatum: "I'm not Belle. I'm not going to do to you what she did to me." Benched from all solo operations indefinitely. Participates in the war room session, contributing his evidence folder while Jordan sorts his approximately 200 photos (43 usable, the rest garbage). Reveals the warehouse contained goods from all fifteen blizzard break-ins labeled by source - a central collection point with inventory tracking, distribution schedules for the next two weeks, territory assignments, a rotation system, and payment records going back a month. Accepts the benching with gratitude rather than defiance.

    At the first mentorship meeting after the raid (Chapter 231, around January 24th), arrives on foot walking stiffly with two cracked ribs confirmed at urgent care. Told his parents he fell doing parkour on icy roofs. During career discussions, initially offers "business, consulting, or project management" before admitting "drag racer" as his real answer. Demonstrates his improved fire control: lights a candle from three feet away with a white-hot razor-thin lance, then provides warmth for the group with red-orange flame pooling from his palms. At the second post-raid meeting (January 31st), is suspiciously calm - "Fine, keeping busy" - which Sam cannot tell is genuine or performed.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Shows up at Sam's house on Valentine's Day (Chapter 235) with expensive chocolates at 8 AM Saturday, asks Sam out, and is turned down - Sam tells him that dating someone in the middle of a war is a distraction. Alex accepts after processing. Sam later realizes she benched Alex for doing the same thing she herself is doing as a supposedly retired hero (Chapter 237).

    Begins parkour training with Sam (Chapter 243), with Thursday morning sessions at 6:30 AM on the rooftop of a commercial building on Cottman Avenue. Sam teaches what she calls "don't-die training" - the emphasis is on learning to leave, not to chase or fight. Covers ingress, traversal, and egress as three separate skills, focusing on traversal only. After a 40-minute session, Alex can drop eight feet quietly, change direction off a wall, and identify three exit routes from any position. His residual heat leaves steam marks on cold metal railings, prompting Sam to note the need for heat-dispersing gloves as an Amelia project. Sam reflects that Liberty Belle gave her missions to handle restlessness, and parkour serves as a safer pressure valve for Alex. Parkour training continues through Chapter 245.

    Present during the Songbird attack on the community center (Chapter 241), pacing and furious, wanting to fight back and wanting to help. Sam shuts him down, telling the mentorship kids that their only job is to not fight Songbirds because the Songbirds want them to fight - a powered kid hurting a Songbird would become "dangerous superpowered kids attack protestors." Sam explicitly addresses Alex in the de-escalation speech, warning that setting a Songbird on fire would destroy the narrative advantage of adults harassing children. His parents do not come to pick him up - they send a taxi, a detail Sam files away as significant.


## Trivia

- His "Hellhound" alias was created by physically warping and melting Sam's old Bloodhound mask. His explanation: "so it was mine." He announced it during the warehouse raid: "Hellhound says hi."
- Sam's old bulletproof vest was sized for a fourteen-year-old girl and sat a little snug on him.
- Sam explicitly invoked Liberty Belle when benching him: "I'm not Belle. I'm not going to do to you what she did to me." She later realized she benched Alex for doing the exact same thing she was doing herself.
- During the Valentine's Day exchange, Alex told Sam: "That didn't stop Peter Parker." Sam's response: "I don't read comics."
- The only member of the initial mentorship cohort not flagged through Dr. Jensen's clinical referral system.
- Jordan sorted 43 usable photos out of approximately 200 Alex took during the raid. Jordan called it "the warehouse he burned down"; Sam corrected: "The warehouse that caught fire."
- In Chapter 225, Sam sees a teenager with bright hair fleeing a Kingdom front fire and initially thinks it is Alex, but the fire has a different smell.
- Expressed interest in drag racing during mentorship career discussions, initially offering "consulting or project management" before admitting the real answer.
