??? warning "Background"

    Alex Kirby is a white teenager who recently relocated to Philadelphia from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. His parents hold mid-level administrative positions in the Pennsylvania state government - not elected officials, but functionaries with enough standing that City Councilman Jamal Davis knows them professionally. It was this professional connection, rather than a referral from Dr. Jensen (who flagged the other mentorship candidates), that secured Alex's place in the pilot peer mentorship program spearheaded by Davis in the aftermath of the Shrike crisis.

    Alex arrived at the first mentorship meeting at the Tacony Music Hall on November 11, 2025, the last of the four initial students to show up. He recognized Sam Small from the Harrisburg senate hearing, establishing an immediate connection to her public profile. During the group's power demonstrations, Alex produced a small flame in his palm, accompanied by a faint smell of propane and alcohol - the first indication of his pyrokinetic abilities.

    Over the following months, Alex participated in regular mentorship sessions at the Parkway Central Library, Franklin Park, Pennypack Park, and eventually the Tacony Community Center. He trained alongside Zara Khan, Liam O'Connor, and Jasmine Walker under Sam and Maggie O'Brien's guidance, developing increasingly precise fire control. However, his desire for bold, decisive action clashed with the program's emphasis on measured development and restraint. In mid-January 2026, Alex revealed he had been conducting unauthorized solo reconnaissance on Kingdom of Keys operations for three weeks and intended to raid a distribution warehouse alone. Despite Sam's objections, she coordinated his operation remotely, during which Alex barely survived an encounter with the Kingdom enforcer Garbage Day. Sam subsequently benched him from all solo operations indefinitely. Alex created his "Hellhound" identity by warping Sam's old Bloodhound mask, declaring it his own.

??? note "Powers & Abilities"

    **PERKS Assessment**

    No official PERKS assessment on file.

    **Abilities**

    - **Pyrokinesis (Torch-Style)** - Generates pressurized jets of an anomalous flammable gas mixture and flash-ignites them. This is not true pyrogenesis; the process produces a chemical mixture that smells faintly of propane and alcohol. The mechanism is closer to a biological blowtorch than spontaneous fire creation.
    - **Variable Flame Control** - Can adjust output through muscle effort, narrowing to a focused hot jet capable of cutting through metal (melted a padlock and deadbolt during the warehouse infiltration) or widening to a dull, short flame suitable for warming or ambient light.
    - **White-Hot Incandescent Beam** - Upper limit of his power: a white-hot beam projected simultaneously from all ten fingers, effective as an oxy-cutting torch. Sustainable for only 10-20 seconds before he loses consciousness.
    - **Flashbang Deployment** - Can accumulate flammable gas at a location and then ignite it as a concussive flash, blinding and disorienting opponents. Used this technique to neutralize two armed guards during the warehouse raid.
    - **Steam Explosion** - Can direct a plasma-torch-intensity flame at snow or water to create a sudden burst of superheated steam, useful as a defensive or area-denial tool.

    **Limitations**

    - Alex is a baseline human outside of his pyrokinesis; he possesses no enhanced durability, regeneration, or secondary physical enhancements.
    - His maximum output (white-hot beam from all ten fingers) is sustainable for only 10-20 seconds before he passes out, leaving him completely vulnerable.
    - He was physically outmatched by Garbage Day during the warehouse raid, demonstrating that his fire is insufficient against opponents with high durability or structural manipulation powers.
    - He sustained serious injuries from conventional weapons during the warehouse operation: a bullet caught by his vest that cracked his ribs, plus two grazing gunshot wounds to his left thigh and left upper arm.
    - His fires produce a distinctive smell (propane and alcohol), which can potentially identify him or his presence at a scene.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Received power control training through the mentorship program under Sam Small and Maggie O'Brien, developing precision fire techniques and de-escalation awareness.
    - Conducted three weeks of independent surveillance and reconnaissance on Kingdom operations, producing hand-drawn maps and stolen distribution schedules - indicating aptitude for fieldwork and intelligence gathering.
    - Demonstrated tactical thinking during the warehouse raid, including using accumulated gas as a flashbang, disarming guards, and stripping and scattering their ammunition.
    - Expressed interest in business and drag racing during mentorship career discussions.

??? warning "Personality"

    Alex Kirby is a romantic in the genre sense - he believes in grand gestures, dramatic action, and making a difference through bold moves. He is driven by a hunger for significance that his emotionally unavailable, career-focused parents fail to provide. He validates frustration and encourages action over patience, not out of malice but out of a deep conviction that heroism is the path to meaning. Mrs. Patterson, the community center's youth services veteran, identified the core of his behavior succinctly: he acts out not because he wants to break rules, but because he does not know who he is if he is not fighting something.

    This romantic disposition makes Alex an interesting counterpoint to Sam Small's increasing cynicism and realpolitik tendencies. Where Sam has learned to think in terms of systems, leverage, and long games, Alex still believes in the power of a single dramatic act to change things. His unauthorized warehouse raid - three weeks of solo reconnaissance culminating in a one-man assault on a Kingdom distribution hub - is the clearest expression of this worldview. He is not reckless in the way of someone who does not think; he is reckless in the way of someone who has thought about it and decided the risk is worth the story. On Valentine's Day, he showed up at Sam's house at 8 AM with expensive chocolates and a rehearsed speech, was turned down gracefully, and accepted the rejection after about ten seconds - passing what Sam internally called "the test" of whether he would push back. His parting observation to Sam was pointed: the situation is not a cowboy movie or an action movie, but it is not a political thriller either, and she could stand to lighten up.

??? warning "Relationships"

    | Character | Relationship | Notes |
    |-----------|-------------|-------|
    | Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Mentor | Sam leads the mentorship program and coordinated Alex's warehouse raid remotely. Benched him from solo operations afterward, explicitly refusing to replicate Liberty Belle's child-soldier model. Alex recognized Sam from the Harrisburg senate hearing. Attempted to ask Sam out on Valentine's Day; was turned down gracefully. |
    | Jamal Davis | Program Facilitator | Davis knows Alex's parents professionally and enrolled Alex in the mentorship pilot through that connection rather than through Dr. Jensen's referral system. |
    | Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) | Peer Mentor | Fellow mentor in the program who helps run sessions and training alongside Sam. |
    | Mr. and Mrs. Kirby | Parents | Mid-level Pennsylvania state government administrators. Emotionally unavailable and career-focused. Did not come to pick Alex up from the community center after the Songbird attack - sent a taxi instead. |
    | Zara Khan | Fellow Mentee | Trains alongside Alex in the mentorship program. Youngest member of the peer group. |
    | Liam O'Connor | Fellow Mentee | Trains alongside Alex. Liam's brashness is described as the "good brash" to Alex's romantic brashness. |
    | Jasmine Walker | Fellow Mentee | Fellow mentorship student. Withdrawn and quiet where Alex is outward and action-oriented. |
    | Tasha Reynolds (Lighthouse) | Operational Support | Provided drone overwatch during the warehouse raid and called fire trucks in advance, which ultimately saved Alex's life when Garbage Day arrived. |
    | Benjamin Small | Associated Adult | Picked Alex up from the laundromat extraction point after the warehouse raid. |
    | Garbage Day | Adversary | Kingdom enforcer who nearly killed Alex during the warehouse raid. Possesses structural manipulation powers that made him physically immune to Alex's fire. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Introduced in Chapter 215 as one of four initial mentorship students at the Tacony Music Hall. Arrives last, recognizes Sam from the Harrisburg senate hearing. Demonstrates pyrogenesis during the power-sharing session, producing a small flame with a propane/alcohol smell. Participates in subsequent mentorship sessions at the Parkway Central Library and Franklin Park, developing fire control.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Major

    Attends mentorship meeting at Sam's house during the Rogue Wave/Kingdom fallout period (Chapter 221), practicing powers in the alley behind the house. Trains at Pennypack Park in January (Chapter 222), using fire to warm the group during winter sessions. Participates in mentorship career discussions, expressing interest in business and drag racing. Briefly glimpsed by Sam fleeing the Rittenhouse Square consulting firm fire (Chapter 225/228), though Sam does not confirm his identity at the time. Reveals three weeks of unauthorized solo reconnaissance on Kingdom operations during the January 14 blizzard crisis (Chapter 229), presenting stolen distribution schedules and hand-drawn surveillance maps. Executes the warehouse raid in Interlude AK.1: infiltrates the Torresdale Avenue warehouse, photographs all 15 break-ins' stolen goods, is shot in the chest (vest saves him) and grazed twice, deploys a gas flashbang to neutralize guards, burns Kingdom records, barely survives Garbage Day's arrival, and limps three blocks to extraction. Debriefed by Sam in Chapter 230; benched from solo operations indefinitely. Sam inspects his injuries and delivers the ultimatum: "I'm not Belle. I'm not going to do to you what she did to me." Present during mentorship meetings in Chapters 229-231 while Sam navigates legal constraints.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the Tacony Community Center grand opening (Chapter 234), lurking near the cookies and watching Sam. Shows up at Sam's house on Valentine's Day (Chapter 235) with expensive chocolates, asks Sam out, is turned down, and accepts gracefully. Described as "incinerating cardboard" and being "very normal" at the community center that same day. Present during the Songbird attack on the community center (Chapter 240), pacing and furious, wanting to fight; Sam shuts him down. His parents do not come to pick him up -- they send a taxi. Sam explicitly addresses him in the de-escalation speech, warning that setting a Songbird on fire would destroy the narrative advantage of adults harassing children.


??? warning "Trivia"

    - Alex's "Hellhound" alias is a deliberate derivation of Sam's "Bloodhound" identity, created by physically warping Sam's old mask. His explanation - "so it was mine" - encapsulates his need to claim significance through connection to established heroic legacy.
    - His fire is explicitly described as more controlled and utility-focused than Aaron McKinley's chaotic fire, positioning the two pyrokinetics as thematic opposites: one a tool user, the other a destroyer.
    - Alex was identified by the arc synopsis as representing the next generation of powered kids Sam is trying to prevent from becoming vigilantes. His unauthorized raid forced Sam to confront the limits of mentorship.
    - Sam explicitly invoked Liberty Belle when benching Alex: "I'm not Belle. I'm not going to do to you what she did to me."
    - During the Valentine's Day exchange, Alex told Sam: "That didn't stop Peter Parker." Sam's response: "I don't read comics."
    - His parents' absence during the Songbird attack - sending a taxi instead of coming themselves - is noted by the narrative as significant and "filed away" by Sam.
    - Alex entered the mentorship program through Davis's professional connections to his parents rather than through Dr. Jensen's referral system, making him the only member of the initial cohort who was not flagged through clinical or institutional channels.
    - Mrs. Patterson described Alex as "a romantic" who acts out because he does not know who he is if he is not fighting something - and noted the parallel to Sam herself.
