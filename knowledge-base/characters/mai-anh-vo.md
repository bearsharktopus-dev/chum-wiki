## Background

Mai-Anh "Annie" Vo is a disillusioned ex-military operative who initially enlisted in the armed forces for college benefits, only to discover that she genuinely enjoyed the structure and violence of military life. Her military service provided extensive combat training and physical conditioning, shaping her into a disciplined and formidable fighter. At some point after leaving the service, she was recruited into Rogue Wave, the anarcho-capitalist criminal organization dedicated to democratizing superpowers through the distribution of the drugs Jump and Fly.

Within Rogue Wave, Annie serves as the primary enforcer and personal bodyguard to Lawrence Sullivan, the organization's leader who operates under the alias Monkey Business. She is the organization's muscle and security specialist, responsible for protecting leadership during operations and eliminating threats through direct physical confrontation. Her role places her at the center of Rogue Wave's most dangerous field operations, from public distribution events to targeted extraction missions against the rival Kingdom of Keys.

Annie tells herself she joined Rogue Wave for ideological reasons -- the organization's belief that powers should be available to everyone rather than controlled by government bureaucracy or genetic lottery. However, she is at least partially aware that her true motivation is simpler: she is good at breaking things, and Rogue Wave gives her a venue to do so. In addition to her Fly-granted bodyguard power, her naturally occurring metahuman ability to disperse physical impact makes her one of the most physically resilient operatives in Philadelphia's criminal underworld.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Impact Dispersal (Primary Power)** -- Annie's primary metahuman ability disperses approximately 90% of any physical impact throughout her entire body, distributing force primarily across her muscles and bones rather than allowing it to concentrate at the point of contact. This renders her effectively immune to most forms of physical damage, including punches, blunt weapons, small-caliber gunfire, and falls. Only high-caliber bullets or equivalent force can overcome this dispersal threshold and cause meaningful injury. Sustained damage over time can wear her out even if individual blows are ineffective.
- **Enhanced Strength** -- The same dispersal mechanism applies to her own muscular effort, spreading exertion across all muscle groups simultaneously. This grants her extreme physical strength disproportionate to her frame, as every movement recruits her entire musculature rather than isolated muscle groups.
- **Passive Physical Conditioning** -- Her power causes all exercise and physical activity to distribute microdamage across every muscle group in her body, effectively making any workout a full-body training session. This results in an exceptionally muscular and conditioned physique without targeted exercise.
- **Guardian Redirection (Fly Power)** -- Annie has been given a secondary Fly-derived power that allows her to redirect any attack aimed at someone she is actively guarding toward herself instead. This makes her an ideal bodyguard, as ranged attacks, projectiles, and other offensive actions targeting her principal are automatically drawn to her impact-dispersing body. During the marina battle in Chapter 157, this ability was demonstrated when she absorbed all of Blink's ranged slingshot attacks that were aimed at Monkey Business.

### Limitations

- High-caliber firearms and weapons of equivalent or greater force can overcome her impact dispersal and inflict real damage.
- Sustained damage over prolonged engagements can accumulate and wear her down, even if individual hits are individually negligible.
- Her guardian redirection power requires active proximity to the person she is protecting; she cannot redirect attacks from unlimited range.
- She possesses no ranged offensive abilities and must close distance to engage targets in combat.

### Training & Skills

- Extensive military combat training, including hand-to-hand fighting techniques and weapons proficiency.
- Highly conditioned physically through both natural training regimens and the passive full-body conditioning effect of her power.
- Experienced in personal security and close protection operations, including threat assessment, perimeter control, and VIP escort.
- Proficient with firearms; described as "heavily armed" during field operations and known to draw weapons reflexively when her principal is threatened.
- Capable of planning and articulating multi-layered protection strategies, as demonstrated when she outlined a three-tier security framework (observation, alert, and intervention) during negotiations with Sam Small.

## Personality

Annie presents an exterior of cold professionalism and emotional detachment. She is disciplined, controlled, and economical in both her speech and her actions, traits that reflect her military background and make her the most composed member of Rogue Wave's core team. She does not engage in the theatrical philosophizing of Monkey Business, the manic energy of Rush Order, or the paranoid intensity of Dead Drop. She is there to do a job, and she does it well. This composure makes her particularly dangerous in confrontations, as she does not lose her temper or make rash decisions under pressure.

Beneath that professional surface, however, Annie harbors a genuine appreciation for violence that she only loosely conceals behind ideological justifications. She claims allegiance to Rogue Wave's mission of democratizing power, but she is at least dimly aware that her real motivation is the satisfaction she derives from her own capabilities. She is intentionally written as a female inversion of the "stupid goon" archetype -- she is not unintelligent, but she is content to leave the thinking and strategizing to the people she considers smarter than herself. She follows orders, protects her principal, and hits whatever needs hitting. This self-aware acceptance of her role within the organization's hierarchy makes her reliable and predictable in ways that Rogue Wave's more ideologically or emotionally driven members are not.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business) | Leader / Romantic partner | Annie serves as Monkey Business's primary bodyguard and enforcer. The two are also seeing each other romantically on the side; everyone in Rogue Wave knows, and nobody cares. |

| Tomas "Tommy" Reynoso (Jackpot) | Colleague | Fellow core member of Rogue Wave. Jackpot's extracted powers supply the Jump that Annie helps distribute and protect. |
| Dean Carver (Rush Order) | Colleague | Fellow core member and field operative. The two have been deployed together on extraction missions, including the Mr. Polygraph operation. |
| Renee "Ren" Costello (Dead Drop) | Colleague | Fellow core member. Dead Drop handles intelligence while Annie handles muscle; they were paired together on the Polygraph extraction team. |
| Elias Franklin (Chimera) | Colleague | Rogue Wave's scientific consultant. Annie works alongside him during operations requiring the full team. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary / Temporary ally | Annie has been present during multiple interactions with Sam, including the marina confrontation and the Shrike protection negotiation. The relationship is strictly professional and transactional. |

## Trivia

- The character reference guide contains a typo in her alias, spelling it "Birhtday Suit" rather than "Birthday Suit."
- Annie is described as intentionally embodying the female version of the "stupid goon" trope -- she is not actually stupid, but she is content to leave strategic thinking to others and focus on what she does best.
- Her power's passive conditioning effect makes her notably muscular ("beefy") because every form of physical activity spreads microdamage across all muscle groups simultaneously, turning any exercise into a comprehensive full-body workout.
- She and Lawrence Sullivan are in an open romantic relationship that the entire Rogue Wave organization is aware of and indifferent to.
- Annie is described as the most controlled member of Rogue Wave's core team, a trait that paradoxically makes her the most dangerous in confrontations because she does not make emotional mistakes.
- Her codename "Birthday Suit" is a darkly humorous reference -- typically meaning "naked" or "unprotected" -- that plays against her actual near-invulnerability.
