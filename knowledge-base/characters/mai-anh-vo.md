## Background

Mai-Anh "Annie" Vo enlisted in the military for college benefits but discovered she genuinely enjoyed the structure and violence of service life. After leaving, she was recruited into Rogue Wave, the anarcho-capitalist organization dedicated to democratizing superpowers through the drugs Jump and Fly.

Annie serves as the primary enforcer and personal bodyguard to Monkey Business, handling security during field operations from public distribution events to targeted extractions. She tells herself she joined for ideological reasons, but is at least partially aware that her real motivation is simpler: she is good at breaking things, and Rogue Wave gives her a venue to do so.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Impact Dispersal (Primary Power)** - Disperses approximately 90% of any physical impact throughout her entire body, distributing force across muscles and bones rather than concentrating it at the point of contact. Effectively immune to punches, blunt weapons, small-caliber gunfire, and falls. Only high-caliber bullets or equivalent force can overcome this threshold.
- **Enhanced Strength** - The same dispersal mechanism applies to her own muscular effort, spreading exertion across all muscle groups simultaneously. Every movement recruits her entire musculature, granting extreme strength disproportionate to her frame.
- **Passive Physical Conditioning** - Her power distributes microdamage from any physical activity across every muscle group, making any workout a full-body training session. This results in an exceptionally muscular physique without targeted exercise.
- **Guardian Redirection (Fly Power)** - Fly-derived secondary power that redirects any attack aimed at someone she is actively guarding toward herself instead. Requires active proximity to her principal.

### Limitations

- High-caliber firearms or equivalent force can overcome her impact dispersal.
- Sustained damage over prolonged engagements accumulates and wears her down even if individual hits are negligible.
- No ranged offensive abilities; must close distance to engage.

### Training & Skills

- Extensive military combat training, including hand-to-hand techniques and weapons proficiency.
- Experienced in close protection operations, including threat assessment, perimeter control, and VIP escort.
- Proficient with firearms; described as "heavily armed" during field operations.

## Personality

Annie presents cold professionalism and emotional detachment - disciplined, controlled, and economical in speech and action. She does not engage in the theatrical philosophizing of Monkey Business, the manic energy of Rush Order, or the paranoid intensity of Dead Drop. This composure makes her particularly dangerous, as she does not lose her temper or make rash decisions under pressure.

Beneath that surface, she harbors a genuine appreciation for violence only loosely concealed behind ideology. Intentionally written as a female inversion of the "stupid goon" archetype - not unintelligent, but content to leave strategy to those she considers smarter. She follows orders, protects her principal, and hits whatever needs hitting.

    Present in Interlude RS-DC-JF at Rogue Wave's Camden safehouse during the team's assessment of Rush Order's fight with Bloodhound.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Rogue Wave continues expanding operations while the Kingdom deals with internal crises.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Accompanies Monkey Business and Rush Order to the Tacony Music Hall to negotiate a protection arrangement with Sam Small during the Shrike crisis (Chapter 205). Arrives in a dinged-up black sedan with Monkey Business, wearing a plaid shirt and jeans rather than tactical gear. Outlines a three-layer protection framework - observation, alert, and intervention - for the Small family and their associates. Draws her pistol alongside Rush Order when Sam unexpectedly cuts Monkey Business's palm with a tooth during the handshake, but stands down when Monkey Business signals acceptance.

    **Role:** Supporting

    Selected by Monkey Business as part of the combat team (alongside Rush Order and Dead Drop) for the Mr. Polygraph extraction operation. Appears in Interlude DC.2 (Rush Order's POV of the operation at Roxborough Memorial Hospital). Summoned from the gym at the Camden safehouse when the operation begins. Demonstrates her near-invulnerability when a mook hits her with a baseball bat and she does not flinch, grabbing the bat and sweeping his legs. During the extraction, tackles Mr. Nothing when he nullifies Rush Order's powers mid-operation, overpowering him through natural strength alone despite her abilities being negated - she plants a boot in Nothing's sternum and sends him flying. Bleeds from her knuckles but grins after the fight. Notably looks away during Snake Oil's power extraction process.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Argus Corps hits Rogue Wave distribution points as part of their enforcement activities; Birthday Suit is not featured directly.


## Trivia

- Her alias is misspelled as "Birhtday Suit" in at least one instance.
- She speaks with a low, raspy voice and a slight accent. Her laugh is described as sounding like a horse nickering.
- She wears a paper birthday hat as a personal touch - her own idea - which she sometimes removes before meetings to maintain a low profile.
- Her codename "Birthday Suit" - typically meaning "naked" or "unprotected" - plays against her actual near-invulnerability.
