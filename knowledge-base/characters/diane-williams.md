## Background

Diane Williams was born in Baltimore on March 17, 1985. Her mother, Martha Williams, died in 1999 from diabetes complications, after which Diane became the primary caregiver for her younger brother, Alex Williams. She graduated from Patterson High School in 2003 with a community service award and enrolled at Towson University to study Criminal Justice. A period of depression led her to temporarily withdraw in 2004, but she returned and graduated in 2008, making the Dean's List in her final year.

On November 3, 2005, Diane survived a catastrophic subway crash in New York City. Trapped beneath rubble for hours, her superhuman abilities manifested. After graduating from Towson, she moved to Philadelphia in 2008 and began operating as "Breakout," receiving her official vigilante license in 2013. In 2010, she encountered Professor Franklin (Jeffery Brown) at an underground superhuman event, and he became her mentor, guiding her from raw physicality to strategic heroism. At his suggestion, she changed her alias to "Liberty Belle" in 2015. She registered with the NSRA in 2016 and joined the Delaware Valley Defenders the same year. Franklin's death at Chernobyl's hands in 2017 caused a brief hiatus, after which she assumed leadership of the Defenders.

In May 2021, Diane was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer from radiation exposure during an earlier encounter with Chernobyl. She continued her duties despite chemotherapy. By late 2023, the cancer had spread to her lungs, liver, and bones. She was killed by Chernobyl at the abandoned PES refinery on the first night of Hanukkah, dying in the arms of her protege, Sam Small.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | G6/S/P/T (Super Strength), B5/S/P/T (Super-Proprioception) |
| **Category** | Gigant, Brain |
| **Power Ranking** | 6/10 |
| **Control** | 9/10 |
| **Hostility** | 0/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 4/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 3/10 |

### Abilities

- **Super Strength (Gigant)** - Tremendous physical strength allowing her to lift and throw cars, trucks, and firetrucks, break concrete pillars, and dent heavy mechanical armor. She could kick vehicles across a road and punch through reinforced doors with ease.
- **Super-Proprioception (Brain)** - Advanced proprioceptive sense that allowed her to detect the precise position, orientation, and movement of her body without relying on visual cues. This ability functioned through her vestibular senses, granting heightened spatial awareness in combat and navigation, particularly useful during low-visibility situations such as nighttime operations and fire rescues.

### Limitations

- Her powers were purely physical and touch-range, offering no defense against ranged attacks, radiation, or environmental hazards beyond her own durability.
- The terminal stomach cancer progressively weakened her over time, reducing her stamina and physical resilience in her final years.
- Her fighting style, while agile, could not fully compensate for opponents with environmental manipulation abilities or heavily armored foes.

### Training & Skills

- Trained in judo and aikido, which she incorporated into her combat style and taught to proteges.
- Criminal Justice degree from Towson University (Class of 2008).
- Skilled detective with extensive files and equipment (bequeathed to Sam Small). Proficient in surveillance, stakeout methodology, and information gathering.
- Decade-long superheroics experience with exceptional power control (9/10 PERKS control rating).
- Trained in first aid; carried a utility belt with supplies during operations.
- In her early Breakout career, drove an armored SUV with police radio and wore layered tactical gear including Kevlar vests, shin guards, forearm braces, and a modified helmet.

## Personality

Diane was charismatic, inspiring, and strategic, with a fierce dedication to justice. She carried herself as a leader who saw potential in others before they saw it in themselves. She had a sense of humor - playing six-on-one basketball with teenagers, using poker to teach misdirection - but could be blunt about difficult truths, telling Sam plainly that she would keep going until she died.

Franklin's mentorship shaped her deeply. He taught her that the name "Breakout" reflected only destruction and encouraged her to embody responsibility, sharing the Benjamin Franklin quote: "By failing to prepare, you're preparing to fail." She nearly quit hero work early on; Franklin convinced her to stay, a turning point she cited during his eulogy.

Later assessments have painted her legacy in a more complex light. Fellow heroes criticized her for recklessness bordering on suicidality and a tactical mindset that failed to account for long-term strategy. Some criticisms hold merit, though she did have a long-term plan that others simply did not agree with.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |

| Chernobyl (Illya Myronovych Fedorov) | Adversary | Killed Professor Franklin, gave Diane her cancer through radiation exposure, and ultimately killed her at the PES refinery. |
| Elijah Brooks (Multiplex) | Colleague | DVD second-in-command. Had philosophical disagreements with Diane about mentoring young heroes, favoring systems over charismatic leadership. |
| Akilah Washington (Puppeteer/Marionette) | Protege | Recruited to the Young Defenders. Left $100,000 in Diane's will. |
| Joshua Pleasants (Miasma) | Friend / Confidant | Close friend bequeathed items in her will. Came to Philadelphia after her death and continued her investigations. |
| Mark Ramirez (Silver Strike) | Ex-partner | Brief relationship in early 2018, ending by mutual agreement in April. |
| Alex Williams | Brother | Younger brother whom Diane raised after their mother's death. |
| Shrike (Niles Nolan) | Adversary (defeated) | Confronted during her Breakout days in Strawberry Mansion (DW.1). Shrike had trapped a family in a lattice of metal spikes. Franklin arrived and incapacitated him with an electrical shock. |
| Martha Williams | Mother (deceased) | Died in 1999 from diabetes complications. |

This scene predates her move to Philadelphia (2008) and her adoption of the Liberty Belle identity (2015).
