??? warning "Background"

    Diane Williams was born in Baltimore on March 17, 1985. She demonstrated leadership qualities from an early age, notably standing up to a school bully at age eight. Her mother, Martha Williams, died in 1999 from complications related to diabetes, after which Diane became the primary caregiver for her younger brother, Alex Williams. She graduated from Patterson High School in 2003 with a community service award and enrolled at Towson University to study Criminal Justice. A period of depression following a failed relationship led her to temporarily withdraw from college in 2004, but she returned the following year and eventually graduated in 2008, making the Dean's List in her final year.

    On November 3, 2005, Diane survived a catastrophic subway crash in New York City. Trapped beneath rubble for hours, her superhuman abilities manifested, allowing her to shield herself and other passengers from the crushing weight. She subsequently sought therapy to cope with the trauma and spent the next several years training and honing her powers. After graduating from Towson, she moved to Philadelphia in 2008 and began operating as a vigilante under the alias "Breakout," a name referencing a brick-breaking video game she had enjoyed in her youth. She received her official vigilante license in 2013.

    In 2010, Diane encountered Professor Franklin (Jeffery Brown) at an underground superhuman event, and he became her mentor. Under his guidance, she refined her approach to heroism, shifting from raw physicality to strategic thinking. In 2015, at Franklin's suggestion, she changed her alias to "Liberty Belle" to better reflect her protective nature. She registered as a superhuman entity with the NSRA in 2016 and officially joined the Delaware Valley Defenders the same year. Professor Franklin's death at the hands of Chernobyl in 2017 deeply affected her, causing a brief hiatus from vigilante work. She subsequently took on the mantle of leadership within the Delaware Valley Defenders, training multiple generations of young heroes.

    In May 2021, Diane was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer, allegedly caused by radiation exposure from an earlier encounter with the supervillain Chernobyl. She began chemotherapy but continued her duties as leader of the Delaware Valley Defenders and the Young Defenders. By the time of her death in late 2023, the cancer had spread to her lungs, liver, and bones, leaving her with an estimated eight to twenty-four months to live. She was killed by Chernobyl at the abandoned PES refinery in Southwest Philadelphia on the first night of Hanukkah, dying in the arms of her young protege, Sam Small.

??? note "Powers & Abilities"

    **PERKS Assessment**

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | **Classification** | G6/S/P/T (Super Strength), B5/S/P/T (Super-Proprioception) |
    | **Category** | Gigant, Brain |
    | **Power Ranking** | 6/10 |
    | **Control** | 9/10 |
    | **Hostility** | 0/10 |
    | **Collateral Damage** | 4/10 |
    | **Threat Level** | 3/10 |

    **Abilities**

    - **Super Strength (Gigant)** - Tremendous physical strength allowing her to lift and throw cars, trucks, and firetrucks, break concrete pillars, and dent heavy mechanical armor. She could kick vehicles across a road and punch through reinforced doors with ease.
    - **Super-Proprioception (Brain)** - Advanced proprioceptive sense that allowed her to detect the precise position, orientation, and movement of her body without relying on visual cues. This ability functioned through her vestibular senses, granting heightened spatial awareness in combat and navigation, particularly useful during low-visibility situations such as nighttime operations and fire rescues.

    **Limitations**

    - Her powers were purely physical and touch-range, offering no defense against ranged attacks, radiation, or environmental hazards beyond her own durability.
    - The terminal stomach cancer progressively weakened her over time, reducing her stamina and physical resilience in her final years.
    - Her fighting style, while agile, could not fully compensate for opponents with environmental manipulation abilities or heavily armored foes.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Trained in martial arts including judo and aikido, which she incorporated into her combat style and taught to her proteges.
    - Criminal Justice degree from Towson University (Class of 2008).
    - Skilled detective whose deductive abilities and investigative tenacity were described as nearly a superpower in their own right. She maintained extensive files and detective equipment that she bequeathed to Sam Small.
    - Proficient in surveillance techniques, stakeout methodology, legal and gray-area investigation methods, and information gathering.
    - Decade-long experience in superheroics with exceptional power control, reflected in her 9/10 PERKS control rating.
    - Trained in first aid and emergency medical response; carried a utility belt with first aid supplies during field operations.
    - In her early career as Breakout, she drove an armored SUV while monitoring police radio and wore tactical gear including layered Kevlar vests, shin guards, forearm braces, and a modified helmet.

??? warning "Personality"

    Diane was charismatic, inspiring, and strategic, with a fierce dedication to justice. She spoke with natural authority and compassion, carrying herself as a leader who saw potential in others before they saw it in themselves. She had a sense of humor, as seen in her willingness to play six-on-one basketball with teenagers and her use of poker to teach misdirection, but could be blunt about difficult truths, telling Sam plainly that she would keep going until she died.

    During her early mentorship under Franklin, she nearly quit being a hero when the work became overwhelming, but Franklin convinced her to stay, a turning point she later cited as pivotal during his eulogy. Franklin's guiding philosophy shaped her deeply; he taught her that her name "Breakout" reflected only destruction and encouraged her to embody responsibility, sharing the Benjamin Franklin quote: "By failing to prepare, you're preparing to fail."

    Later assessments have painted her legacy in a more complex light. While her dedication to uncovering corruption beneath institutions like Daedalus was genuine, many fellow heroes criticized her for recklessness bordering on suicidality, an inability to know when to give up, and a tactical mindset that failed to account for long-term strategy. Some of these criticisms hold merit, though she did have a long-term plan that others simply did not agree with. Her decision to confront Chernobyl alone at the refinery, despite her terminal illness, exemplifies both her courage and her self-destructive tendencies.

??? warning "Relationships"

    | Character | Relationship | Notes |
    |-----------|-------------|-------|
    | Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Protege | Recruited Sam to the Young Defenders, trained her in combat and detective work, and left her all detective equipment and files in her will. Sam was present at her death. |
    | Professor Franklin (Jeffery Brown) | Mentor (deceased) | Her most formative relationship. Franklin guided her from a raw vigilante into a disciplined hero and suggested the Liberty Belle name. His death at Chernobyl's hands in 2017 haunted her for the rest of her life. |
    | Chernobyl (Illya Myronovych Fedorov) | Adversary | The supervillain who killed Professor Franklin, gave Diane her cancer through radiation exposure, and ultimately killed her at the PES refinery. |
    | Elijah Brooks (Multiplex) | Colleague | Second-in-command of the Delaware Valley Defenders during the Liberty Belle era. Had philosophical disagreements with Diane about mentoring young heroes, favoring systems over charismatic leadership. |
    | Akilah Washington (Puppeteer/Marionette) | Protege | Recruited Akilah to the Young Defenders. Left her $100,000 in her will. |
    | Joshua Pleasants (Miasma) | Friend / Confidant | Close friend who was bequeathed items in her will. Came to Philadelphia after her death and continued her investigations. |

    | Alex Williams | Brother | Younger brother whom Diane raised after their mother's death. |
    | Shrike (Niles Nolan) | Adversary (defeated) | Villain she confronted during her early Breakout days in the Strawberry Mansion area. Shrike was stealing copper wiring from homes and had trapped a family of three in a lattice of metal spikes. Diane fought him through a spike-filled rowhome, taking a wound to her calf before Franklin arrived and incapacitated Shrike with an electrical shock. Franklin knew Shrike's real name was Niles and zip-tied him for containment transport, possibly to Daedalus. |
    | Martha Williams | Mother (deceased) | Died in 1999 from complications related to diabetes, instilling in Diane a strong sense of responsibility. |
