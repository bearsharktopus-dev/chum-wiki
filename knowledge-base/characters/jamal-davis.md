## Background

Jamal Davis is a Philadelphia city councilman who serves as the civilian liaison for the Delaware Valley Defenders, the city's premiere registered superhuman team. In this capacity, he functions as the de jure leader of the organization, managing its political relationships, providing institutional cover, and coordinating with law enforcement and government agencies on the team's behalf. While Liberty Belle served as the de facto field leader during her lifetime, Davis handled the administrative and political dimensions of the DVD's operations.

Davis first came to Sam Small's attention during her early days with the Young Defenders, when he joined the senior DVD members to assess drone footage of a Kingdom of Keys murder at Dobson Mills. His role expanded significantly during Arc 4, when Sam confronted him with evidence of a government conspiracy protecting Chernobyl. Sam initially suspected Davis of complicity in the cover-up, but Davis forcefully denied any knowledge, explaining that he had been following NSRA safety directives without awareness of the underlying arrangement. He proposed an off-the-books investigation to avoid government scrutiny, offering to provide surplus equipment and resources while working official channels. This covert arrangement effectively gave birth to "The Auditors," an unofficial investigative team comprising Sam, Jordan, and Spindle, with Davis providing political cover from behind the scenes.

Over the course of the story, Davis has evolved from a background authority figure into one of Sam's most important institutional allies. He has repeatedly navigated the tension between his public office and his private support for Sam's increasingly aggressive methods, maintaining official distance when necessary while quietly providing intelligence, resources, and political protection. His relationship with Sam deepened through moments of crisis — advising her during the Maya Richardson election, providing a keycard override granting Sam access to DVD headquarters, and texting quiet encouragement after her confrontation with Richardson at town hall.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file. Davis possesses no superhuman abilities.

### Abilities

- N/A — Jamal Davis has no superpowers. His value to the Delaware Valley Defenders and to the broader Philadelphia superhero community is entirely political, strategic, and institutional.

### Limitations

- As a baseline human, Davis has no physical capabilities beyond those of an ordinary person. He cannot participate in combat operations or field missions.
- His effectiveness is constrained by political realities — every action he takes must be weighed against potential consequences for his elected position, the DVD's legal standing, and the broader political landscape.
- His off-the-books support for Sam places his career and legal standing at considerable risk.

### Training & Skills

- Experienced politician with deep knowledge of Philadelphia's government structure, legislative processes, and municipal bureaucracy.
- Skilled negotiator and diplomat, capable of managing relationships across the superhero community, law enforcement, federal agencies, and city government simultaneously.
- Knowledgeable about RICO laws, chain of evidence requirements, and the legal complexities surrounding superhuman prosecution.
- Adept at redirecting government funding and navigating institutional channels — demonstrated by his ability to redirect historical preservation funding triggered by Garbage Day's attack on the Music Hall into the community center renovation.
- Maintains professional connections across Pennsylvania state government, including relationships with families like the Kirbys (mid-level state government functionaries from Harrisburg).

## Personality

Davis is diplomatic, strategic, and cautious to his core. He speaks carefully, weighing the political implications of every word before it leaves his mouth. He genuinely believes in the value of superhero work and has demonstrated real courage in supporting Sam's investigations off-the-books, but he never loses sight of the political realities that constrain his actions. He intervenes in disputes among DVD members with measured authority, reminding colleagues of the importance of unity and communication rather than taking sides.

Beneath the politician's polish, Davis possesses a moral seriousness that has sharpened over time. The Shrike incident in Arc 14 — watching Sam, a teenager, kill a white supremacist on live television — triggered a crisis of faith in the entire young-superhuman-to-hero pipeline. His growing disillusionment did not lead to paralysis but to action: he spearheaded a mentorship program designed to offer powered youth an alternative to becoming child soldiers. When pushed past his limits, Davis does not explode — he plans. Maya Richardson sending Garbage Day after Sam and injuring Tasha Reynolds, a civilian noncombatant, crossed a line in his book. His response has been to bide his time, build evidence, and wait. As the character reference guide notes, "the guns will come out soon enough."

Had the Faraday cage room professionally built to classified signal-blocking standards, clearly knowing what the Auditors would use it for.

## Trivia

- Davis sealed his secret alliance with Sam in Chapter 49 with a fist bump and the phrase "For great justice," establishing a tone of conspiratorial idealism that has characterized their relationship since.
- He signs his text messages to Sam with "-JD."
- Miasma initially warned Sam against trusting Davis, calling him "the governmentest, stoogiest of them all" — an assessment that proved wrong when Davis proposed the off-the-books investigation.
- Davis knows the Kirby family professionally through Pennsylvania state government connections, which is how Alex Kirby entered the mentorship program rather than being flagged through Dr. Jensen's referral system like the other students.
- The community center renovation was made possible because Garbage Day's attack on the Music Hall triggered historical preservation funding, which Davis redirected to the project — turning an act of violence against Sam into institutional support for powered youth.
- His keynote speech at the grand opening was deliberately timed by Miasma to coincide with Elena Morales's televised confession, maximizing media impact in Maya Richardson's district.
- The legal case United States v. Davis (2005), which established the legal framework for treating superhuman abilities as weapons, shares his surname but is not confirmed to involve him directly.
