## Background

Jamal Davis is a Philadelphia city councilman who serves as the civilian liaison and de jure leader of the Delaware Valley Defenders. Under the RSE legal framework, every registered superhuman team requires a civilian regulator for oversight; Davis fills this role, managing political relationships, institutional cover, and coordination with law enforcement and government agencies. While Liberty Belle served as de facto field leader during her lifetime, Davis handled the DVD's administrative and political dimensions.

After Liberty Belle's death and Sam Small's discovery of the government's arrangement with Chernobyl, Davis became one of Sam's most important institutional allies. Convinced of his own ignorance of the cover-up, he proposed an off-the-books team - Sam, Jordan, and Spindle with Miasma as adult supervision - operating outside the DVD's FOIA-accessible records. Davis would work official channels, provide surplus equipment through discreet "dumpster drops," and offer political cover, at enormous personal risk: exposure would cost him his council seat, team leadership, and potentially the entire DVD. He delivered the story's title drop during this meeting: "Chumming the water before we can go hunting for sharks. Pun somewhat intended."

Over the course of the story, Davis has navigated the tension between his public office and private support for Sam's increasingly aggressive methods. He has provided intelligence, resources, keycard access to DVD headquarters, and political protection while maintaining official distance. His role has expanded from background authority figure to active political combatant - ultimately building a five-member council coalition that stripped Maya Richardson of Argus Corps oversight and championing the conversion of the Auditors' Music Hall into the Tacony Community Center.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file. Davis possesses no superhuman abilities.

### Abilities

- N/A - Jamal Davis has no superpowers. His value is entirely political, strategic, and institutional.

### Limitations

- Baseline human with no combat capabilities.
- Every action must be weighed against consequences for his elected position, the DVD's legal standing, and the broader political landscape.
- His off-the-books support for Sam places his career and legal standing at considerable risk.

### Training & Skills

- Experienced politician with deep knowledge of Philadelphia's government structure, legislative processes, and municipal bureaucracy.
- Skilled negotiator and diplomat across the superhero community, law enforcement, federal agencies, and city government.
- Knowledgeable about RICO laws, chain of evidence requirements, and the legal complexities of superhuman prosecution.
- Adept at navigating government funding streams - secured insurance, emergency city funds, and historical preservation funding for the Music Hall repairs.
- Understands the legal architecture of the RSE system, including FOIA requirements, registration constraints, and insubordination consequences.

## Personality

Davis is diplomatic, strategic, and cautious to his core, weighing the political implications of every word. He genuinely believes in superhero work and has demonstrated real courage in supporting Sam's off-the-books investigations, but never loses sight of political realities. He can command silence in a packed room with a single word: "Quiet." Usually jovial, he shifts to gravity and urgency when the situation demands it, and his nostrils flare when thinking hard.

Beneath the politician's polish, Davis possesses a moral seriousness that has sharpened over time. His discovery that people above him had been using him to protect a supervillain made him "sick to his stomach," and his response was to risk his career on a covert investigation rather than accept the status quo. When pushed past his limits, Davis does not explode - he plans, marshaling his political tools methodically against his targets.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in Chapter 6 as "Mr. Davis" via his labeled locker at DVD headquarters. Identified as the de jure head and civilian regulator of the DVD.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First appearance in Chapter 15. Present at DVD headquarters when Sam and the Young Defenders review drone footage of a Kingdom of Keys murder at Dobson Mills. Described as bald, wearing professional attire, with gentle charisma and warm wise eyes. His signature greeting is a firm, friendly handshake. Has been trying to push the Kingdom investigation through bureaucratic channels with limited success - "like trying to make headway through thick molasses." Asks practical questions about the footage, including whether the drone operator had permission to fly.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appears across multiple chapters with an expanding operational role. In Chapter 32, he leads the briefing on the Philly Phreaks threat with stern authority, confirming cell phone tracking of the tipster and Sam's classification as a Visually-Apparent Metahuman. In Chapter 34, he confirms from footage that Deathgirl is a power copier. In Chapter 37, he leads the tactical briefing on the Chernobyl industrial thefts in northeast Philadelphia, outlining the two-fold threat of Chernobyl and Kingdom synergy and assigning the Young Defenders to disaster relief and civilian management rather than direct combat. In Chapter 41, he mediates at the debriefing after Sam witnesses a Kingdom execution, initially expressing skepticism - "Are we sure this isn't just bravado for the crowd?" - before proposing that the Kingdom may be trying to establish direct contact with Chernobyl rather than merely scavenging his leftovers. In Chapter 44, he issues evacuation orders during the Chernobyl crisis, directing teams to evacuate south of Broad Street and warning about Kingdom operatives using the chaos. He ordered Liberty Belle to stand down and appease Chernobyl per government policy - an order Belle defied.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Major Supporting

    Appears at Liberty Belle's will reading in Chapter 46, looking haggard, tired, and sunken. Contradicts Multiplex's warning that the government might contest Sam's inheritance: "I have no intention of contesting this will." Tells Sam, "This city owes a lot to heroes like you and Liberty Belle." Gives the final eulogy at Belle's funeral in Chapter 47, carefully navigating the political complexities of Belle's defiance: "When the time came to make the call, to evacuate or to stand and fight, Diane did what she believed was right for the city she loved." Admits they "often butted heads" but with "deepest respect."

    Central role in Chapter 49. Sam confronts Davis with the Chernobyl confession video, accusing him of knowing about the government-Chernobyl arrangement. Davis slams the table hard enough to break a folding chair leg and shouts her full name: "Samantha Elisabeth Small!" Claims ignorance - he received NSRA reports saying "Avoid at all costs" and "Minimize contact" regarding Chernobyl, which he interpreted as safety advisories about radiation danger. Once convinced, he proposes "Young Defenders Dark" - Sam, Jordan, and Spindle operating off the books with Miasma as adult supervision. Davis will work official channels and provide government surplus equipment via "dumpster drops." He identifies the strategic logic: all DVD operations are recorded and FOIA-accessible, so the investigation must exist outside official channels. Sam will serve as bait to provoke the NSRA into overreacting. The stakes for Davis are enormous: exposure would cost him his team leadership, council seat, and could destroy the entire DVD. He lowers his fist to Sam's chest: "For great justice?" Sam bumps it. He also delivers the title drop: "Chumming the water before we can go hunting for sharks. Pun somewhat intended." Notable detail: Davis slid Sam's phone back across the table noting "It has not been recording anything" - Sam had not thought to record the conversation.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appears in Chapter 91 at a DVD leadership meeting, noting that losses of Professor Franklin and Liberty Belle have left the DVD "stretched alarmingly thin" and raising the need to promote Young Defenders. Intervenes with measured authority when tensions arise: "something you'd like to share with the rest of the class?" In Chapter 92, Davis draws Crossroads, Puppeteer, and Rampart aside for a private discussion about the graduation process. In Chapter 100, he congratulates Crossroads on graduation to the senior team and oversees Rampart's appointment as new Young Defenders leader, as well as Captain Plasma's transfer from Los Angeles.

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the full DVD meeting in Chapter 113 following Patriot's attack on Sam at the Tacony Charter homecoming dance. Seated at the head of the table with shoulders slumped. Will contact DC legal aid groups for superhero and vigilante rights in preparation for Sam's congressional testimony.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Supporting

    In Chapter 120, Sam seeks Davis's guidance after Richard Duvall dismisses her concerns about Richardson's Kingdom ties. Davis confirms the DVD has suspected Richardson's alter ego as Mrs. Zenith for years but cannot build a concrete case: "they're slippery, always one step ahead." Explains the Kingdom's use of intermediaries with no connections higher up the ladder, discusses limitations of postcognitive background checks, and advises: "We have to follow the rules. Even when - especially when - it's inconvenient." In Chapter 125, present at the DVD debrief after Sam's Kingdom investigation at the Crescent, described as having an "unreadable expression, tired but firm." Advocates for gathering more intel before making moves.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Calls a meeting in Chapter 151 where Clara Parker announces the Young Defenders' impending dissolution under Richardson's Superhuman Activity Regulation Act. In Chapter 152, Sam calls Davis to discuss legal limitations of pursuing the Kingdom; Davis explains RICO prosecution complexities - establishing shell companies, burden of proof, and paper trails. Referenced in Chapter 160 as present at an emergency city council session responding to the Rogue Wave crisis.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Provides Sam with a keycard override granting access to DVD headquarters (Chapter 166), which Sam uses for medical treatment from Nurse Sylvia Moore. Sam texts Davis before meeting Mr. Antithesis in New York (Chapter 173) as a safety protocol: "try to scry me in 2-3 hours." After the meeting, Davis says he cannot legally condone her actions or use evidence gathered through vigilante diplomacy. Present in Chapter 177 when Sam delivers the Stheno data flash drive and one Hypeman autoinjector. Davis is "concerned but more measured" compared to Multiplex's fury over Sam's three gunshot wounds and near-drowning. Commits to analyzing the data and building a case, saying "if" evidence leads to Richardson. Referenced in Interlude MR.6 as repeatedly texting Richardson - "Need to talk about what happened at the warehouse" - angry about Argus Corps' off-the-books warehouse involvement. Richardson ignores his texts.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    After Sam's confrontation with Richardson at town hall (Chapter 192), Davis texts Sam: "Nice work tonight. -JD," signaling covert political alignment without public commitment. Referenced as supporting Rachel Small's Parents of Powered Kids coalition.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam calls Davis at 3:42 AM in Chapter 204 after the Shrike crisis. He arrives in a hastily thrown-on suit with toothpaste on his collar. Proposes witness protection (weeks to set up), an NSRA manhunt, and Defenders safe rooms as options, reminding Sam: "You're sixteen, Sam." Sam includes Davis on her protection list.

    In Chapter 211, Davis visits with architect John Horvath's blueprints for converting the Music Hall into a community center with youth programs, after-school activities, and meeting space. Pitches it as legitimizing the Auditors' presence: "A community center with a superhero team isn't a vigilante hideout." Also proposes a mentorship program for Activated youth who do not want to become heroes or villains, citing the Whitford Institute as a model. Wants to use his council position to zone the building properly. Sam and Tasha are interested; Derek is ambivalent.

    In Chapter 215, Davis brings snacks (cookies, juice boxes) to the mentorship session. Four students attend: Zara Khan (glass sensing and control), Liam O'Connor (partial dragon transformation), Alex Kirby (pyrogenesis), and Jasmine Walker (who passes on demonstrating her power). Davis sets ground rules - "You're not lab rats" - and mentions plans for a press conference in a few months. He leaves for about an hour, letting Sam and Maggie lead.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Meets with Sam at his City Hall office (Room 507) in Chapter 219 following Garbage Day's attack on the Music Hall. Looks terrible - stubble, bloodshot eyes. Reports the Music Hall will be out of commission for months due to water damage, insurance complications, and historic preservation requirements. Furious about Tasha being attacked, pledges to use his political tools against Richardson. Gives Sam a phone number for anonymously tipping the DVD on a post-it note, and notes the Music Hall falls within Richardson's district. In Chapter 221, Davis calls Sam about the 19 arrests at Roxborough Memorial - including high-value target Mr. Polygraph (Lucas Donovan) - implicitly acknowledging Sam's anonymous tip: "whoever made that call - they did the right thing." Informs Sam that Music Hall repairs are funded through insurance and emergency city funds, approximately nine weeks. Warns that the Kingdom will respond to losing Mr. Polygraph. In Chapter 222, Tasha reports Davis called with a construction update: upper floors by late February or early March, lobby usable by mid-February. Davis is aware of the Silverstein shell company evidence but cannot convince the DA without a preponderance of evidence; the data sits encrypted on Jordan's server.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Gives a speech at the Tacony Community Center grand opening (Chapter 233), critiquing the child-soldier superhero pipeline and introducing the center as an alternative. Performs a ceremonial key handoff to Sam in Chapter 234 - a velvet box with a photographer present, containing keys for the office, Faraday cage room, and roof access. Warns Sam the center will be a target from "Songbirds, Kingdom, anyone who benefits from powered kids having nowhere to go." Referenced in Chapter 237 as part of Sam's intel distribution circuit.

    In Chapter 244, Silverstein pauses when he sees Davis's name on Sam's community center paperwork, and Sam directs Silverstein to speak with Davis as a colleague-to-colleague channel. In Interlude MR.10, Davis has built a coalition of five council members to vote for stripping Richardson of Argus Corps oversight, with Silverstein co-sponsoring the motion. The transition is effective April 1st. After Richardson's resignation, Davis comments diplomatically: "personal decision that we respect."
