??? warning "Background"

    Chezki Espinosa began his military service at age eighteen, entering the Israel Defense Forces before advancing into Mossad as a specialized operative. After approximately four years of service carrying out operations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Espinosa experienced a superhuman activation event during a mission in Rafah, Gaza. His unit was directed to neutralize a target named Mohammed al-Rashidi in a residential building. When intelligence redirected the team to a secondary structure, the building was shelled by Israeli artillery while Espinosa was still inside. The strike, which killed his teammate Yosef and was later recognized as deliberate friendly fire, buried Espinosa under tons of rubble. He emerged alive, having manifested extreme physical durability and strength that rendered him virtually indestructible.

    The Israeli government quickly recognized the value of Espinosa's abilities and turned him into a national asset. He was deployed as a one-man demolition force across Iran, Lebanon, Syria, and other conflict zones, carrying out missions that those in comfortable offices marked on maps. In the intervening years, Espinosa wore weighted clothing to remain grounded - fifteen kilograms sewn into his suit jacket lining and another ten in a vest beneath his shirt, weights that had to be recalibrated every few months as his body continued to densify. By 2011, his body had grown so dense and powerful that custom porcelain armor weighing one hundred and sixty kilograms was designed to allow him to interact with the world without destroying it. He was housed in a special dormitory and deployed continuously across Iran, Lebanon, and Syria, reducing targets to coordinates and people to designations. His mother in Haifa remained the only person who still called him, asking when he was coming home, when he was getting married, when he would give her grandchildren - normal questions he could not answer. Over the years, Espinosa grew disillusioned with the men who directed him, viewing their perpetual warfare as self-serving rather than motivated by genuine security concerns. A deputy minister once told him, "You don't need to understand. You just need to perform."

    Espinosa's break with Israel came approximately eleven years before the main story timeline (circa 2014–2015) at a classified security briefing in the Knesset. Invited to be displayed before politicians and generals - twelve men around a table in a chamber off the main floor - he sat through two hours of briefings on regional threats while watching the comfortable officials laugh, drink warm coffee, and make jokes during a meeting about casualty projections. He then confronted the assembled officials, accusing them of perpetuating unnecessary violence for their own benefit and of shelling the Rafah building with him inside. He physically seized a general by the skull - a man with soft hands and a vacation tan who soiled himself in terror - delivered a scathing denunciation of the establishment, declaring that "the cruelty is the purpose," killed the man, announced his resignation, and walked out. The Israeli government covered up the incident, blaming the death on Hamas. Espinosa fled to a safe house in Cyprus, where he attempted to clean blood from under his fingernails with a pocketknife and discovered he could still bleed when the blade punctured his skin - a detail that surprised him, as he had nearly forgotten the sensation. Cross contacted him via encrypted message ("Heard about your retirement. Coffee?") and invited him to Zurich, where the two and other former government operatives they had connected with during the Daedalus project founded Red Calf Security Solutions in 2015.

    As de facto leader of Red Calf, Espinosa has shaped the organization according to his nihilistic philosophy: a world of perpetual escalating warfare where humanity either evolves from the ashes or proves his belief that the cruelty is the purpose. Under his direction, Red Calf has become one of the most feared and best-compensated employers of metahumans in the world, implicated in numerous war crimes but too useful to major governments to face real scrutiny.

??? note "Powers & Abilities"

    **PERKS Assessment**

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | **Classification** | G10 (extreme durability and strength) |
    | **Category** | Gigant |
    | **Power Ranking** | 10/10 |
    | **Control** | Unknown |
    | **Hostility** | Unknown |
    | **Collateral Damage** | Unknown |
    | **Threat Level** | Extreme |

    Espinosa is one of the few G10-rated superhumans on record. His PERKS assessment is referenced in intelligence briefings but the full breakdown beyond his classification and power ranking has not been disclosed.

    **Abilities**

    - **Superhuman Strength** - Muscle-based super-strength on a scale entirely beyond other known superhumans. Described as the "world's strongest superhuman," capable of giving fictional benchmarks like Superman or Homelander a competitive fight. His strength manifested during his activation event when he lifted a concrete slab weighing several hundred kilograms while buried under a collapsed building with a broken arm.
    - **Near-Impenetrable Skin** - His skin and body have become so dense and durable that conventional weapons, including small arms fire, are entirely ineffective against him. A Palestinian youth struck him with a chunk of concrete at full force and the concrete chipped off his skin without leaving a mark. He is described as impervious to most small arms and able to neutralize armored threats in close combat.
    - **Accelerated Healing** - Espinosa demonstrated rapid healing immediately after his activation event, when a broken arm that should have been shattered beyond repair showed only fading bruises within hours. During the Rafah debriefing, military doctors could find no evidence of the fracture. Later, in the Cyprus safehouse, a pocketknife puncture to his finger still produced blood, suggesting that while his durability had become extreme, he retained some capacity to be wounded by sharp implements at close range during that period.
    - **Progressive Physical Enhancement** - Espinosa's body continues to build itself without his input, growing denser and stronger over time. His muscle mass increases without exercise or nutrition, his bones become denser, and his overall weight steadily climbs. Without his weighted armor, he described feeling as though gravity had forgotten how to hold him. This ongoing enhancement has made it increasingly difficult for him to interact with the normal world without specialized equipment.
    - **Primal Intimidation Aura** - Espinosa's physical presence triggers an instinctive fear response in those around him, described as the "lizard brain recognizing a predator before the conscious mind catches up." Even the man seated beside him on his flight to New York shifted away without realizing he was doing it. This effect persists even among powerful political and military figures; the entire room of Knesset officials visibly contracted away from him when he took a step forward.

    **Limitations**

    - **Environmental Destruction** - Espinosa's sheer strength and density make normal interaction with the world extremely difficult. Without his weighted porcelain armor, he cracks concrete simply by walking and cannot touch objects without risking their destruction.
    - **Porcelain Armor Dependency** - He wears custom hyper-weighted porcelain armor weighing approximately one hundred and sixty kilograms to dampen his strength enough to interact with his environment in a quasi-normal fashion. Without it, basic tasks like holding a cup, shaking hands, or sitting in a chair require careful force calculation.
    - **Progressive Isolation** - His body's continuing densification means the armor must be periodically upgraded with additional weight, and the gap between his physical capabilities and the fragile world around him continues to widen.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Extensively trained in Mossad special operations, including unarmed combat, small arms proficiency, and demolitions.
    - Years of field experience conducting covert operations, assassinations, and sabotage missions across the Middle East, North Africa, and beyond.
    - Strategic and tactical leadership experience running Red Calf's global operations.
    - Proficient in operational planning and coordination of combined conventional and superhuman military operations.

??? warning "Personality"

    Espinosa is confident, quiet, and professional. He does not mince words and carries himself with a calm, calculated demeanor that contrasts sharply with the enormous weight of his demands and the threat he represents. He is not conventionally supervillainous; those who interact with him describe the experience less as encountering a madman and more as dealing with an implacable force that simply cannot be refused. His presence triggers a primal recognition in others, a lizard-brain awareness of a predator that manifests even in powerful figures like Mr. Antithesis, who destroyed his own office in frustrated rage after meeting with Porcelain.

    Espinosa monitors his own heart rate as a matter of habit - sixty-eight to seventy beats per minute during combat operations - the way other people check the weather. He drinks black coffee, invariably cold by the time he gets to it, a recurring ritual that persists from his IDF days through his Knesset confrontation and beyond. Beneath the professionalism lies an anarchistic nihilist whose worldview was forged in the rubble of Rafah and hardened by years of being used as a disposable weapon. He does not believe the violence itself was wrong but rather that it was unnecessary violence conducted by comfortable men who treated warfare as a way to justify their own power. His philosophy has crystallized into a vision of perpetual escalating conflict, where stability is never allowed to form and humanity must either evolve or be proven unworthy. He orchestrates chaos on a global scale with methodical precision, timing crises across multiple cities to maximize disruption.

??? warning "Relationships"

    | Character | Relationship | Notes |
    |-----------|-------------|-------|
    | Dov | IDF teammate (survived) | Espinosa's teammate during the Rafah operation. Dov had a pregnant wife, Miriam, expecting their first child, a girl they planned to name Shira. He survived the building collapse and was found sitting on an armored vehicle in shock afterward. One of Espinosa's last thoughts before the collapse was that Dov's daughter would have her father. |
    | Yosef | IDF teammate (deceased) | A young, barely twenty-year-old teammate who still flinched when shooting started. Killed by shrapnel to the throat during the Rafah operation while covering the perimeter. Espinosa visited his grave once between deployments and found grass growing on it; Yosef's parents thanked Espinosa for his service without knowing the full circumstances of their son's death. |
    | Director Harrison | Daedalus project director | American official who welcomed Espinosa to the Daedalus construction project as a consulting specialist. Described Espinosa as Israel's "contribution to the international effort." Maintained a professional demeanor around Espinosa despite awareness of his capabilities. |
    | Espinosa's Mother | Mother | Lives in Haifa. The only person who still called Espinosa during his years as Israel's weapon, persistently asking when he was coming home, getting married, and giving her grandchildren. Espinosa let her calls go to voicemail and told himself he would call back later. |
    | Jared Cross (Tarbaby) | Co-founder / Colleague | Met during Daedalus construction in 2006–2007 when Cross served as a stress tester for the containment cells, producing corrosive substances to probe the facility's defenses. The two recognized each other as former government tools over coffee in the empty commissary. Cross was formerly British Royal Engineers, then freelance. He invited Espinosa to Zurich after his break with Israel, leading to Red Calf's founding. |
    | Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Subordinate (Kingdom intermediary) | Meets with Richardson to demand Kingdom assistance with the Daedalus prison break. Richardson cannot refuse his requests. |
    | Trent Fairfax (Mr. Antithesis) | Subordinate (Kingdom leader) | The Kingdom of Keys operates subordinate to Red Calf. Porcelain's demands cause Antithesis rare emotional distress and he threatens to expose Richardson's connections if refused. |
    | Morris "Pop-pop" Small | Historical acquaintance | Met Pop-pop during Daedalus construction in 2006–2007 as an Israeli consultant named "Espinosa." Espinosa studied Morris's file upon arrival and noted his family history - second-generation American, father arrived as a child refugee in the 1930s, the family that sent him vanished into the camps. Espinosa recognized in Morris the look of a diaspora Jew who grew up in the shadow of survival and approached him to praise his weatherproofing work, calling it important and noting that Morris "understood the assignment better than most." Morris deflected the compliment with a joke about comic books. |
    | Liberty Belle (Diane Williams) | Subject of investigation | Belle investigated Porcelain before her death, connecting him to Daedalus and writing "Porcelain?" in her notebook. Pop-pop confirmed the Espinosa-Porcelain link to Belle. |
    | Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary (indirect) | Sam discovers the Porcelain-Espinosa-Daedalus connection through Belle's notes and library archives. Porcelain's operations directly impact Sam's world. |
    | Daisy Zhen (Deathgirl) | Target of interest | Red Calf orchestrated the Daedalus prison break specifically to extract Deathgirl, viewing her power-copying abilities as a valuable weapon. Observed her courthouse hearing after her escape. |
    | Samuel Royce (Gallows) | Colleague | Red Calf operative; former U.S. Marine sniper who "doesn't talk about why he left the Marines." Met during Daedalus construction period. Espinosa described the mutual recognition among the Daedalus consultants as "tools that have realized they're being used." |
    | Anika Voss (Lotus) | Colleague | Red Calf operative; former Slovak intelligence officer who "speaks seven languages and none of them contain the word truth." Met during Daedalus construction period. |
    | Lt. Gen. Dominic Hartley | Colleague | Red Calf COO; former British general who retired after an incident that never made the papers. Met during Daedalus construction period as one of the specialists who "consults" on containment projects. |
    | Kingdom of Keys | Organizational subordinate | The Kingdom operates under Red Calf's authority, carrying out contracted operations and receiving directives from Porcelain. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    The name "Porcelain?" appears underlined in red ink in Liberty Belle's notebook about Chernobyl, discovered by Sam during her investigation of Belle's materials (Chapter 48). This is the first reference to the character in the story.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Interlude (MR.4)

    First on-screen appearance. Porcelain meets Maya Richardson in a sterile office space after her recruitment meeting for Argus Corps. He commends her recent successes, requests her assistance in extracting a dangerous individual (implied to be Deathgirl) from Daedalus Correctional Facility, and demonstrates calm authority that leaves Richardson unable to refuse. He also inquires about purchasing Hypeman for Red Calf.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Major presence across multiple interludes and referenced events. In Interlude MR.8, Porcelain meets with Mr. Antithesis at the Kingdom's Manhattan office, demanding the Kingdom execute the Daedalus prison break on September 10th. His meeting leaves Antithesis so distressed he destroys his own office. He threatens to expose Richardson's Kingdom connections if they refuse, and specifically schedules the operation during state senate hearings to exploit the protests as a distraction. In Interlude MS.1, Pop-pop Small's flashback reveals "Espinosa" was an Israeli consultant at the Daedalus construction site in 2006–2007, and Pop-pop confirms to Sam that Belle showed him a photo connecting Espinosa to Porcelain. In Interlude BM.3, Mr. Antithesis reveals to Kingdom operatives that they have been contracted by Red Calf and Porcelain specifically to extract Deathgirl, offering $2 million per surviving operator. In Chapter 196, Sam discovers documents in the Morrison Collection linking "Chezki Espinosa" (Israeli military trainer from 2006) to Porcelain, along with information about Red Calf Security Solutions founded in 2015. In Interlude EW.1, the Daedalus prison break is executed as a forced collaboration between the Kingdom and Red Calf, with Red Calf operatives Vector and Tarbaby participating alongside Kingdom members. In Interlude DZ.2, a mysterious observer at Daisy Zhen's courthouse hearing is identified as Porcelain/Chezki Espinosa, indicating Red Calf's continued interest in Deathgirl after her escape. The arc summary confirms that Porcelain orchestrated simultaneous crises across multiple cities as part of his manufactured chaos strategy.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Red Calf situation referenced as occurring in Germany, diverting federal resources and leaving Philadelphia vulnerable to Kingdom operations during a blizzard engineered by Maya Richardson.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** Interlude (CE.1)

    Porcelain's origin story told in first person. Chronicles his Mossad career, beginning with the Rafah operation in which his unit was sent to capture Mohammed al-Rashidi in a residential building. After intelligence redirected the team to a secondary building, Israeli artillery shelled the structure with Espinosa inside - a deliberate tactical decision. Teammate Yosef was killed by shrapnel; teammate Dov survived. Espinosa's activation event occurred as he pushed a concrete slab weighing several hundred kilograms off himself with a broken arm. He emerged to find the building completely leveled and was struck by a Palestinian youth with a concrete chunk that shattered against his unmarked skin. The debriefing revealed his injuries had already healed, and no one apologized for shelling the building. Subsequent scenes cover his deployment across Iran, Lebanon, and Syria; his flight to New York wearing weighted clothing (25 kg total); his arrival at the Daedalus construction project where he met Director Harrison, stress tester Jared Cross, and weatherproofing contractor Morris "Moe" Small; nighttime scenes of removing weights and feeling untethered from gravity; the arrival of his 160 kg porcelain armor in 2011; his dramatic resignation at a Knesset security briefing where he seized a general, denounced the establishment, killed the general, and walked out; his retreat to a Cyprus safehouse where Cross contacted him; and his departure for Zurich. The interlude also references other figures Espinosa met during the Daedalus period - Royce (American sniper), Voss (Slovak intelligence), and Hartley (British general) - who later became Red Calf colleagues.


??? warning "Trivia"

    - The codename "Porcelain" derives from the white ceramic composite armor he wears to dampen his strength, which Israeli propagandists used to create a symbolic image of a gleaming guardian angel.
    - Red Calf's official public mission statement is "To provide effective, ethical, and innovative military solutions to governments and organizations committed to the pursuit of global security," a stark contrast to its actual operations.
    - The core leadership of Red Calf all met during the 2006–2007 Daedalus construction project, where they served as consultants and contractors from various national agencies.
    - Pop-pop Small recognized Espinosa as a fellow Jew during their brief interaction at Daedalus and noted the difference between Israeli and diaspora Jewish identity.
    - The Interlude CE.1 origin story opens and closes with lyrics from Butthole Surfers' "Pepper," framing the narrative of violence and disillusionment.
    - During the Rafah operation, Espinosa monitored his heart rate at sixty-eight to seventy beats per minute while breaching a building - a discipline he described as telling him "what kind of day you're going to have."
    - Espinosa's flight to New York for the Daedalus consulting assignment took eleven hours, during which he pretended to sleep while the passenger next to him unconsciously shifted away.
    - At the Daedalus commissary, Cross made coffee with the efficiency of "someone who has done it a thousand times in a thousand temporary facilities" and handed Espinosa a cup black without asking how he took it.
    - When removing his 25 kg of weights at night in his Daedalus quarters, Espinosa felt as though he might float away, as if gravity had forgotten how to hold him.
    - Espinosa's Knesset confrontation included him drinking cold Starbucks coffee from a plastic cup during the two-hour briefing - a detail that parallels his habitual cold coffee consumption throughout the interlude.
    - The general Espinosa killed at the Knesset soiled himself in terror. Espinosa described the moment with dark humor, noting "What - ha ha - like they could arrest me?"
    - In the Cyprus safehouse, Espinosa attempted to clean blood from under his fingernails with a pocketknife, but the blade tip punctured when he pushed too hard and the metal buckled, producing a shallow cut that bled - a sensation he had nearly forgotten he was capable of experiencing.
    - Red Calf is officially listed as "not a designated terrorist organization" despite its extensive war crimes implications, largely because it remains too useful to the United States for real scrutiny.
    - Approximately 30–40% of Red Calf's active operatives are powered individuals, with custom equipment tailored to their abilities.
    - The intelligence community considers Espinosa a priority surveillance target and regards countermeasure development against his enhanced physiology as a critical need.
