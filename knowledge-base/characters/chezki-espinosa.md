## Background

Chezki Espinosa entered the Israel Defense Forces at eighteen and advanced into Mossad as a specialized operative. After approximately four years of service, he experienced a superhuman activation event during a mission in Rafah, Gaza, when Israeli artillery shelled the building he was inside - a strike later recognized as deliberate friendly fire. Teammate Yosef was killed; Espinosa was buried under tons of rubble and emerged having manifested extreme physical durability and strength.

The Israeli government deployed him as a national asset across Iran, Lebanon, Syria, and other conflict zones. His body continued to densify over the years, requiring first weighted clothing (25 kg total) and eventually custom porcelain armor weighing 160 kg (delivered in 2011) to interact with the world without destroying it. He grew disillusioned with the officials who directed him, viewing their perpetual warfare as self-serving. A deputy minister once told him, "You don't need to understand. You just need to perform."

His break with Israel came circa 2014-2015 at a classified Knesset security briefing, where he confronted assembled politicians and generals, declared "the cruelty is the purpose," and resigned violently. What exactly happened to the general he seized is deliberately ambiguous. He fled to a safehouse in Cyprus, where Jared Cross contacted him and invited him to Zurich. Together with other former government operatives they had connected with during the Daedalus construction project, they founded Red Calf Security Solutions in 2015.

As de facto leader of Red Calf, Espinosa has shaped the organization according to his nihilistic philosophy: perpetual escalating warfare where humanity either evolves from the ashes or proves his belief that the cruelty is the purpose. Red Calf has become one of the most feared employers of metahumans in the world, implicated in numerous war crimes but too useful to major governments to face real scrutiny.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | G10 (extreme durability and strength) |
| **Category** | Gigant |
| **Power Ranking** | 10/10 |
| **Control** | Unknown |
| **Hostility** | Unknown |
| **Collateral Damage** | Unknown |
| **Threat Level** | Extreme |

Espinosa is one of the few G10-rated superhumans on record. His PERKS assessment is referenced in intelligence briefings but the full breakdown beyond his classification and power ranking has not been disclosed.

### Abilities

- **Superhuman Strength** - Muscle-based super-strength on a scale entirely beyond other known superhumans. Described as the "world's strongest superhuman," capable of giving fictional benchmarks like Superman or Homelander a competitive fight.
- **Near-Impenetrable Skin** - His body is so dense that conventional weapons, including small arms fire, are entirely ineffective. A chunk of concrete thrown at his face chipped on impact without leaving a mark (Rafah, post-activation).
- **Accelerated Healing** - Demonstrated rapid healing immediately after his activation event; a broken arm showed only fading bruises within hours, with military doctors finding no evidence of the fracture. He can still bleed from sharp implements at close range - a pocketknife punctured his skin in the Cyprus safehouse - though whether this remains true as of the present is unclear.
- **Progressive Physical Enhancement** - His body continues to densify without exercise or nutrition, growing stronger and heavier over time. Without his weighted armor, he feels as though gravity has forgotten how to hold him. The armor must be periodically upgraded with additional weight.
- **Primal Intimidation Aura** - His physical presence triggers instinctive fear, described as the "lizard brain recognizing a predator." Even the passenger beside him on a flight unconsciously shifted away, and a room of Knesset officials visibly contracted when he stepped forward.

### Limitations

- **Environmental Destruction** - Without his 160 kg porcelain armor, he cracks concrete simply by walking and cannot touch objects without risking their destruction. Basic tasks like holding a cup or shaking hands require careful force calculation.
- **Progressive Isolation** - His continuing densification means the armor must be periodically upgraded, and the gap between his capabilities and the fragile world around him continues to widen.

### Training & Skills

- Extensively trained in Mossad special operations, including unarmed combat, small arms proficiency, and demolitions.
- Years of field experience conducting covert operations, assassinations, and sabotage missions across the Middle East, North Africa, and beyond.
- Strategic and tactical leadership experience running Red Calf's global operations.
- Proficient in operational planning and coordination of combined conventional and superhuman military operations.

## Personality

Espinosa is confident, quiet, and professional - not conventionally supervillainous. Those who interact with him describe the experience less as encountering a madman and more as dealing with an implacable force that simply cannot be refused. Mr. Antithesis destroyed his own office in frustrated rage after a meeting with Porcelain.

He monitors his heart rate as a matter of habit - sixty-eight to seventy beats per minute during combat - the way other people check the weather. He drinks black coffee, invariably cold by the time he gets to it. Beneath the professionalism lies an anarchistic nihilist whose worldview was forged in Rafah and hardened by years as a disposable weapon. He does not believe the violence itself was wrong, but rather that it was unnecessary violence conducted by comfortable men who treated warfare as a way to justify their own power. His philosophy has crystallized into a vision of perpetual escalating conflict, orchestrated with methodical precision across multiple cities simultaneously.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Dov | IDF teammate (survived) | Espinosa's teammate during the Rafah operation. Dov had a pregnant wife, Miriam, expecting their first child, a girl they planned to name Shira. He survived the building collapse and was found sitting on an armored vehicle in shock afterward. One of Espinosa's last thoughts before the collapse was that Dov's daughter would have her father. |
| Yosef | IDF teammate (deceased) | A young, barely twenty-year-old teammate who still flinched when shooting started. Killed by shrapnel to the throat during the Rafah operation while covering the perimeter. Espinosa visited his grave once between deployments and found grass growing on it; Yosef's parents thanked Espinosa for his service without knowing the full circumstances of their son's death. |
| Director Harrison | Daedalus project director | American official who welcomed Espinosa to the Daedalus construction project as a consulting specialist. Described Espinosa as Israel's "contribution to the international effort." Maintained a professional demeanor around Espinosa despite awareness of his capabilities. |
| Espinosa's Mother | Mother | Lives in Haifa. The only person who still called Espinosa during his years as Israel's weapon, persistently asking when he was coming home, getting married, and giving her grandchildren. Espinosa let her calls go to voicemail and told himself he would call back later. |
| Jared Cross (Tarbaby) | Co-founder / Colleague | Met during Daedalus construction in 2006-2007 when Cross served as a stress tester for the containment cells, producing corrosive substances to probe the facility's defenses. The two recognized each other as former government tools over coffee in the empty commissary. Cross was formerly British Royal Engineers, then freelance. He invited Espinosa to Zurich after his break with Israel, leading to Red Calf's founding. |
| Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Subordinate (Kingdom intermediary) | Meets with Richardson to demand Kingdom assistance with the Daedalus prison break. Richardson cannot refuse his requests. |
| Trent Fairfax (Mr. Antithesis) | Subordinate (Kingdom leader) | The Kingdom of Keys operates subordinate to Red Calf. Porcelain's demands cause Antithesis rare emotional distress and he threatens to expose Richardson's connections if refused. |
| Morris "Pop-pop" Small | Historical acquaintance | Met Pop-pop during Daedalus construction in 2006-2007 as an Israeli consultant named "Espinosa." Espinosa studied Morris's file upon arrival and noted his family history - second-generation American, father arrived as a child refugee in the 1930s, the family that sent him vanished into the camps. Espinosa recognized in Morris the look of a diaspora Jew who grew up in the shadow of survival and approached him to praise his weatherproofing work, calling it important and noting that Morris "understood the assignment better than most." Morris deflected the compliment with a joke about comic books. |
| Liberty Belle (Diane Williams) | Subject of investigation | Belle investigated Porcelain before her death, connecting him to Daedalus and writing "Porcelain?" in her notebook. Pop-pop confirmed the Espinosa-Porcelain link to Belle. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary (indirect) | Sam discovers the Porcelain-Espinosa-Daedalus connection through Belle's notes and library archives. Porcelain's operations directly impact Sam's world. |
| Daisy Zhen (Deathgirl) | Target of interest | Red Calf orchestrated the Daedalus prison break specifically to extract Deathgirl, viewing her power-copying abilities as a valuable weapon. Observed her courthouse hearing after her escape. |
| Samuel Royce (Gallows) | Colleague | Red Calf operative; former U.S. Marine sniper who "doesn't talk about why he left the Marines." Met during Daedalus construction period. Espinosa described the mutual recognition among the Daedalus consultants as "tools that have realized they're being used." |
| Anika Voss (Lotus) | Colleague | Red Calf operative; former Slovak intelligence officer who "speaks seven languages and none of them contain the word truth." Met during Daedalus construction period. |
| Hartley | Colleague | Red Calf operative; former British general who retired after an incident that never made the papers. Met during Daedalus construction period as one of the specialists who "consults" on containment projects. |
| Kingdom of Keys | Organizational subordinate | The Kingdom operates under Red Calf's authority, carrying out contracted operations and receiving directives from Porcelain. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    The name "Porcelain?" appears underlined in red ink in Liberty Belle's notebook about Chernobyl, discovered by Sam during her investigation of Belle's materials (Chapter 48). This is the first reference to the character in the story.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Interlude (MR.4)

    First on-screen appearance. Porcelain meets Maya Richardson in a sterile office space after her recruitment meeting for Argus Corps. He commends her recent successes, requests her assistance in extracting a dangerous individual (implied to be Deathgirl) from Daedalus Correctional Facility, and demonstrates calm authority that leaves Richardson unable to refuse. He also inquires about purchasing Hypeman for Red Calf.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Major presence across multiple interludes and referenced events. In Interlude MR.8, Porcelain meets with Mr. Antithesis at the Kingdom's Manhattan office, demanding the Kingdom execute the Daedalus prison break on September 10th. His meeting leaves Antithesis so distressed he destroys his own office. He threatens to expose Richardson's Kingdom connections if they refuse, and specifically schedules the operation during state senate hearings to exploit the protests as a distraction. In Interlude MS.1, Pop-pop Small's flashback reveals "Espinosa" was an Israeli consultant at the Daedalus construction site in 2006-2007, and Pop-pop confirms to Sam that Belle showed him a photo connecting Espinosa to Porcelain. In Interlude BM.3, Mr. Antithesis reveals to Kingdom operatives that they have been contracted by Red Calf and Porcelain specifically to extract Deathgirl, offering $2 million per surviving operator. In Chapter 196, Sam discovers documents in the Morrison Collection linking "Chezki Espinosa" (Israeli military trainer from 2006) to Porcelain, along with information about Red Calf Security Solutions founded in 2015. In Interlude EW.1, the Daedalus prison break is executed as a forced collaboration between the Kingdom and Red Calf, with Red Calf operatives Vector and Tarbaby participating alongside Kingdom members. In Interlude DZ.3, a mysterious observer at Daisy Zhen's courthouse hearing is identified as Porcelain/Chezki Espinosa, indicating Red Calf's continued interest in Deathgirl after her escape. The arc summary confirms that Porcelain orchestrated simultaneous crises across multiple cities as part of his manufactured chaos strategy.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Red Calf is mentioned by Miasma during a conversation with Sam, who vaguely recognizes the name but cannot place it. Later, a Red Calf international incident in Germany is referenced as diverting federal superhuman resources offshore, leaving Philadelphia vulnerable to Kingdom operations during a blizzard engineered by Maya Richardson.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    During Sam's confrontation with Maya Richardson in her office, Maya tries to redirect Sam toward Porcelain and the Daedalus breakout as a bigger threat, implying the breakout was not accidental and offering to "point you in the right direction." Sam refuses the misdirection. Later, Maya writes "Red Calf" on her legal pad as a potential redirect target for Bloodhound.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** Interlude (CE.1)

    Porcelain's origin story told in first person. Chronicles his Mossad career, beginning with the Rafah operation in which his unit was sent to capture Mohammed al-Rashidi in a residential building. After intelligence redirected the team to a secondary building, Israeli artillery shelled the structure with Espinosa inside - a deliberate tactical decision. Teammate Yosef was killed by shrapnel; teammate Dov survived. Espinosa's activation event occurred as he pushed a concrete slab weighing several hundred kilograms off himself with a broken arm. He emerged to find the building completely leveled and was struck by a Palestinian youth with a concrete chunk that shattered against his unmarked skin. The debriefing revealed his injuries had already healed, and no one apologized for shelling the building. Subsequent scenes cover his deployment across Iran, Lebanon, and Syria; his flight to New York wearing weighted clothing (25 kg total); his arrival at the Daedalus construction project where he met Director Harrison, stress tester Jared Cross, and weatherproofing contractor Morris "Moe" Small; nighttime scenes of removing weights and feeling untethered from gravity; the arrival of his 160 kg porcelain armor in 2011; his dramatic resignation at a Knesset security briefing where he seized a general by the skull, denounced the establishment, released the general, kicked him, and walked out; his retreat to a Cyprus safehouse where Cross contacted him; and his departure for Zurich. The interlude also references other figures Espinosa met during the Daedalus period - Royce (American sniper), Voss (Slovak intelligence), and Hartley (British general) - who later became Red Calf colleagues.


## Trivia

- The codename "Porcelain" derives from his white ceramic armor, which Israeli propagandists used to create the image of a gleaming guardian angel.
- Red Calf's official public mission statement is "To provide effective, ethical, and innovative military solutions to governments and organizations committed to the pursuit of global security" - a stark contrast to its actual operations.
- Interlude CE.1 opens and closes with lyrics from Butthole Surfers' "Pepper."
- At the Daedalus commissary, Cross made coffee with the efficiency of "someone who has done it a thousand times in a thousand temporary facilities" and handed Espinosa a cup black without asking how he took it.
- His internal monologue during the Knesset confrontation included the darkly humorous thought "What - ha ha - like they could arrest me?"
- Red Calf is officially listed as "not a designated terrorist organization" despite extensive war crimes implications, largely because it remains too useful to the United States for real scrutiny. Approximately 30-40% of its active operatives are powered individuals.
- The intelligence community considers Espinosa a priority surveillance target and regards countermeasure development against his physiology as a critical need.
