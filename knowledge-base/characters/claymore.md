## Background

Claymore is a journalist and young woman who underwent a traumatic activation event at the Boston Commons during the September 9, 2025 protests. Her powers manifested involuntarily while police were kettling protesters, producing a flash and pressure wave that injured approximately one hundred people protesting alongside her. She also vaporized her own hair during the uncontrolled discharge. The experience left her deeply guilt-ridden and struggling with the constant mental calculations of blast radii that accompanied her new abilities.

After months training alone in an abandoned shipping facility in South Boston, the Red Shocks discovered her and the Colonel offered her a place with people who understood what she was going through. By approximately January 2026 - roughly four months after activation - she had become a functional member of the team and participated in her first operational mission: a break-in at Alcott Properties in the Seaport district to copy documents proving collusion between the developer and city officials in expediting evictions in East Boston.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Explosive Body Part Detonation** - Claymore can detach parts of her body - fingernails, hair, and larger segments such as fingers or thumbs - and cause them to detonate on impact, converting biological tissue into concussive force (pressure waves rather than thermal energy). Ghostwriter estimated her overall explosive density at roughly two-thirds that of dynamite, with significantly less waste heat.
- **Scalable Yield** - Energy output varies by tissue type: a single fingernail produces approximately 150 joules (sufficient to crack a deadbolt), a full finger approximately 800 joules. She calibrates output to specific tasks, using hair as improvised detonation cord and varying quantities for different structural targets.
- **Rapid Regeneration** - All detonated body parts regenerate. Fingernails regrow in approximately 30 to 40 minutes; a severed thumb regenerates in one to two hours, with a thick callus forming instantly to seal the wound. Hair also regrows rapidly.
- **Tissue Detachment** - Body parts detach voluntarily without pain, producing only a soft "click" of disconnection. Callus tissue forms immediately over exposed surfaces.

### Limitations

- Detached body parts cannot be reattached; they can only be replaced through regeneration.
- Regeneration imposes significant caloric debt, requiring front-loaded food intake before operations.
- Fingernails are aerodynamically poor projectiles, described as "fluttery."
- Larger expenditures (full fingers, thumbs) produce proportionally more force but require longer regeneration and greater caloric cost.
- The constant mental calculation of blast radii is psychologically taxing and cannot be turned off - she describes it as "a song I cannot stop humming."

### Training & Skills

- Trained in breaching techniques under the Red Shocks, learning to calibrate explosive yield to specific structural targets (padlocks, deadbolts, reinforced doors, keycard locks).
- Journalist, with a self-described "journalism reflex" for cataloging environmental details automatically.
- Read Russian literature recreationally prior to her activation (specifically The Master and Margarita by Bulgakov).
- Had a brother with some technical knowledge.

## Personality

Claymore is analytical, self-aware, and haunted by her activation event. She uses humor and sarcasm as deflection, cracking jokes to cover visible anxiety and engaging in the team's banter despite being the newest member. She draws a firm moral line between targeted property damage and harm to people, and her internal monologue repeatedly returns to the imperative of choosing restraint - a need to prove to herself that she is "a person who can make bombs" rather than a bomb.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| The Colonel | Leader / Mentor | Recruited Claymore from the abandoned shipping facility. Communicates in economical silences and sparse acknowledgments; Claymore learned more from his silences than from hours of Ghostwriter's monologues. |
| Ghostwriter | Teammate | Wears archival gloves, uses books as part of his power set, and can absorb information from documents by eating them. Provided intellectual context and emotional check-ins for Claymore. Estimated her explosive density and encouraged her to experiment with hair as a detonation medium. |
| Red Scare | Teammate | Lean, wiry build with a liquid movement quality. Teaches self-defense at a community center in Jamaica Plain. Coached Claymore on psychological adjustment to constant threat awareness, assuring her the mental calculations would get "quieter." |
| Lavender Girl | Teammate | Plant-growth abilities; serves as technical support and emotional warmth. Grows vegetables for mutual aid networks and made protein bars for Claymore's caloric needs. Reminded Claymore that using her power was "spending, not sacrificing." |

    **Role:** POV (Interlude CM.1)

    Narrated a first-person account of her recruitment by the Boston Red Shocks, her training to control her explosive body part detonation abilities, and her first operational mission - a break-in at Alcott Properties in the Seaport district to copy documents proving developer collusion with city officials in expediting evictions in East Boston. The interlude also depicted her activation event at the Boston Commons (September 9, 2025) in flashback, where she involuntarily injured approximately one hundred fellow protesters.


## Trivia

- Claymore's interlude code is "CM," with CM.1 being her sole narrated chapter.
- The Boston Commons explosion was reported in the main story as a "suspected terrorist attack" during the September 9, 2025 protests, referenced in connection with the Daedalus prison break and state senate hearings. Reports noted "no conventional bomb was used" and evidence pointed to an activation incident.
- The name "Claymore" references the Claymore directional mine. The shortened "Clay" is used by teammates casually, while "Claymore" is reserved for operational contexts.
- She wore a "slitted cloth" tied around her face as a mask during her solo training period before joining the Red Shocks.
- Her hair vaporized during her activation event and subsequently regrew, suggesting regeneration was active from the moment of activation.
- She mentioned owning a Hitachi personal massager in a deflective joke during training, using crude humor to manage anxiety about her own destructive capabilities.
- The Red Shocks operated out of the basement of a used bookstore in Allston, with the owner maintaining plausible deniability about their activities.
- Lavender Girl's protein bars were described as tasting "like cardboard and desperation."
- Her phone screen was cracked from being dropped during training, at the same moment she successfully blew a fist-sized hole in a concrete wall with exactly the intended yield.
- The Alcott Properties targeted by the Red Shocks shares a name with Alcott & Associates, the law firm run by Trent Fairfax (Mr. Antithesis of the Kingdom of Keys), suggesting the Red Shocks may be unknowingly targeting Kingdom front companies.
- She compared the sensation of voluntarily detaching a fingernail to "unclenching a fist" and, more colorfully, to a bowel movement.
