## Background

Lucas Donovan was born on September 15, 1985, in Trenton, New Jersey, to Victoria and Raymond Donovan. His power first manifested on June 17, 2001, during a family dinner when he felt an itching sensation in his skull as his father lied about his whereabouts - tying his abilities directly to the domestic deceptions that defined his upbringing.

After relocating to Philadelphia in 2007, Lucas worked as a bartender while quietly using his lie-detection to identify cheating patrons. By 2010, he had drifted into organized crime, earning the nickname "Polygraph" in a small-time gang and freelancing his interrogation services after the gang disbanded in 2016. On October 31, 2019, Mr. Antithesis recruited him as a founding member of the Kingdom of Keys, where he became co-lead interrogator alongside Mr. Nothing (Darnell Hayes). He served at the center of the Kingdom's intelligence operations until his capture and depowering by Rogue Wave in late 2025. After months depowered and weeks in a cell, the charges against him were dropped when prosecutors couldn't establish a connection between his presence at the hospital and any criminal activity. Trent Fairfax kept him on salary, covered his legal fees, and provided him with a selection of Fly compounds. Lucas chose a new power - Preclusion - and was rechristened Mr. Preclude, assuming the role of Mr. Nothing's second-in-command in Philadelphia.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Preclusion (Current)** - Gained through Fly compounds provided by Mr. Antithesis after his original power was extracted. Described as "authoritative" rather than observational - Lucas "makes rules." The full scope and mechanics of this ability have not yet been detailed, but Trent considers it "distinctive" and Chezki Espinosa immediately recognizes its tactical utility. Represents a fundamental shift in Lucas's operational posture from detecting problems to dictating solutions.

- **Lie Detection (Former - Extracted)** - Lucas formerly possessed an extrasensory ability to determine whether someone was truthfully responding to a question he asked. When a subject spoke a falsehood, he experienced a distinct unpleasant twinge, referred to as a "ping," in the back of his skull. This ability functioned regardless of physical proximity and operated over telephone calls, video calls, and any other medium that transmitted spoken communication. The power detected subjective truth rather than objective reality, meaning it registered whether the speaker believed they were telling a falsehood rather than whether the statement was factually accurate. This power was extracted by Snake Oil during his capture by Rogue Wave (Arc 15), crystallizing into a blue-green crystal. The resulting ability was later acquired by Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business).

### Limitations (Former Power)

- Required spoken communication; completely ineffective against written statements, non-verbal cues, or text-based deception.
- Clever wordplay, half-truths, and technically correct but misleading statements could circumvent the power.
- Simultaneous lies from multiple speakers could overwhelm the ping sensation, requiring mental discipline to manage.
- Recorded playback did not trigger the power - only live speech from the actual speaker (exploited by the Auditors during the Soot sting, Arc 11).

### Training & Skills

- One of the best marksmen in the Kingdom of Keys among members whose powers do not enhance their aim. He is consistently described as a crack shot with firearms.
- Excellent chess player, reflecting his strategic intelligence and capacity for anticipating opponents' moves.
- Genuinely intelligent, capable of running complex interrogations that blend psychological pressure with his supernatural abilities.
- Skilled in intimidation and psychological manipulation, employing threats of extreme violence (such as Yakuza-style finger removal) to extract compliance even without using his power.
- Practiced meditator, using breathing techniques to manage his anger issues and maintain composure during high-pressure interrogations.
- Experienced in impersonating law enforcement, having successfully posed as NSRA Agent Parker with fabricated credentials during the Hatboro-Horsham investigation.

## Personality

Lucas presents as professional and controlled, but significant anger management issues simmer beneath the surface. He is impulsive in his thinking but disciplined in his actions, possessing the self-awareness to lid his volatile impulses most of the time. When the lid slips, the results are explosive - firing his gun into machinery in frustration (Arc 1), breaking a subordinate's nose (Arc 4), or escalating confrontations beyond tactical necessity. His rage appears rooted in a deep-seated frustration with dishonesty, exacerbated by a power that forces him to confront untruths constantly.

Professionally, he is direct, authoritative, and comfortable with lethal force, treating violence as a business tool within the Kingdom's criminal pragmatism. Outside of work, he enjoys classic detective novels, jazz music, poker, and maintains a collection of vintage polygraph machines.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First appears in Chapter 12 alongside Mr. Nothing and Mudslide at the abandoned Dobson Textile Factory. Described as a white man with dark black hair, facial stubble, wearing a navy blue suit with a black undershirt and sunglasses, with a holstered pistol. Interrogates a captive about connections to Liberty Belle while overseeing Mudslide's loyalty test, which results in the captive being buried alive. Discovers Sam Small and Jordan Westwood after they fall through rotten floorboards. Interrogates Sam at gunpoint, revealing his lie-detection abilities and threatening to shoot her if she lies. References "Mr. B" - a Kingdom lawyer or fixer. Sam exploits the limitation that he can't directly reference the murder in his questions. Fires his gun into machinery in frustration when Sam bluffs about streaming audio, allowing the teens to escape. Engages in a brutal fight in Chapter 13, emptying his clip wildly at Jordan's elevated platform (grazing Sam twice on the upper arm and thigh). Fights hand-to-hand with his larger, heavier frame before Sam bites deep into his shoulder, breaking bone. Gets punched repeatedly by Sam. Pistol-whips Sam with his gun handle. Retreats when police sirens approach.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as a subject in the drone footage shown to the adult Delaware Valley Defenders by the Young Defenders team. Sam's intel provides "Mr. Nothing, Mr. Polygraph, Mudslide" as the first identified Kingdom operative names - a major breakthrough for the adults, who previously had zero operative names despite knowing of the organization. Mrs. Zenith later references "P and N" (Mr. Polygraph and Mr. Nothing) as the operatives Sam "fucked up" in her encounter with Mr. Tyrannosaur.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Leads the Halloween night recruitment meeting at the Kingdom warehouse at 4547 Trenton Avenue alongside Mrs. Heartbeat. Described with salt-and-pepper hair, a dense grey-white mustache, red-rimmed eyes, and a tailored dark sharp suit. Addresses approximately 30 recruits, explains the initiation test requiring them to convert stolen goods from the Chernobyl haul into $20,000 cash each by mid-December, and threatens to shoot any undercover officers - quizzing each person with his lie-detection power before they leave. In Chapter 41, executes a suspected informant with two gunshots (one through the forehead, one through the sternum) after the man was tested by his lie detection and "found wanting." This event is witnessed by Sam, Jordan, Jamila, and Spinelli, who are hiding inside the warehouse. Jordan records his speech on an iPhone, capturing his reference to tailing Chernobyl and using the word "fruitful." Video footage is later presented to the Delaware Valley Defenders and Councilman Davis as evidence.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appears in the AMK.1 interlude alongside Mr. Tyrannosaur. Summons Aaron McKinley to demand repayment of lost Kingdom funds. Threatens to cut off Aaron's pinky finger in a Yakuza-style punishment (Yubitsume), terrorizing him with a utility knife before pocketing it and instead breaking his nose with a punch. Reveals that the Kingdom has identified "Wolf" as Bloodhound, a junior cape interfering with their operations. Assigns Aaron to kill Bloodhound as a means of redeeming himself, but withholds her name and address to avoid making it "easy mode." Appears in Chapter 57 posing as NSRA Agent Parker alongside Mr. ESP (Agent Evans) at the Hatboro-Horsham NSRA crime scene. His shoulder is still visibly injured from Sam's bite months earlier - arm cradled close to his body. Has shaved off his mustache to change his appearance. Sam and Jordan deliberately tell lies to trigger his power and make him reveal information through his reactions. Falters when Sam questions his specific reference to abandoned buildings, confirming Kingdom surveillance of their activities. Agent Evans pulls him away after the confrontation escalates. Photograph taken by Sam becomes evidence of Kingdom members impersonating federal officers, later shown to NSRA Agent Torres during intelligence sharing, who confirms the man in the photo matches the Halloween warehouse video.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting (Interlude)

    Appears in the BM.1 interlude (Mr. Tyrannosaur's POV) at a Kingdom leadership meeting. Arrives visibly injured from a recent assault by Fly-powered attackers ("gutter punks from the Liberties"). Asks the room what they know about Fly, then reports on the emergence of the drug and its implications - powers in pill form without an activation event. References Mr. ESP's failure with the Chernobyl/Fedorov recruitment. Treats his injuries at the break room's first aid dispenser, popping ibuprofen and applying bandaids. Invites Mr. Tyrannosaur to unwind at a strip club afterward, and they depart Kingdom headquarters together in Lucas's Cadillac.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present during the Soot sting operation (the Washes operation) alongside Mr. Retribution, Mrs. Quiet, and Mr. Nothing. Described with a chinstrap beard (having shaved off his mustache) and a raspy, tired voice. Arrives at Lardner's Point Park where the Kingdom offers $2,000 to the Washes for first interrogation rights. Questions the disguised Sam about her knowledge of the Trenton Avenue warehouse. His lie-detection powers are bypassed during the interrogation because Sam was not actually speaking - Devonte's sound-replaying ability was feeding Kate's pre-recorded voice through the mask, and Lucas confirms "She's being honest." Demands to see "Soot's" face to confirm identity, threatening to expose the entire deception. A police siren diversion created by Devonte prevents him from unmasking Sam. In the MR.7 interlude following the operation, stands behind his chair during the Kingdom debriefing at the Spruce Street safehouse (a paranoid habit - he never sits during debriefs). Assigned by Maya Richardson alongside Mr. Nothing to coordinate with Mrs. Xenograft on rebuilding Hypeman production at the Camden backup facility.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as the target of Rogue Wave's favor demand. Rogue Wave delivers an envelope to Sam via hospital mail containing a single folded paper reading "Mr. Polygraph. We'll be in touch." - establishing that their price for helping protect Sam's family from Shrike is assistance capturing Lucas. Sam later explains to the team that Rogue Wave wants help capturing Mr. Polygraph, describing him as the Kingdom's internal security.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Captured in the Rogue Wave operation at Roxborough Memorial Hospital. Sam tips off Rogue Wave about the Kingdom's evidence disposal at the hospital, and Rush Order uses his "pigeon sense" - the ability to locate anyone by full legal name - to track Lucas's movements. Rogue Wave sets up a multi-day stakeout using a geased private investigator as bait. When the Kingdom finally sends advance security along with Lucas and Mr. Nothing to investigate, they are ambushed by Rogue Wave's combat team (Rush Order, Birthday Suit, Dead Drop). Rush Order tackles and captures Lucas while Birthday Suit takes down Mr. Nothing. Lucas is transported to Rogue Wave's Camden safehouse where Elias (Chimera) administers novocaine and Snake Oil performs the power extraction through direct physical contact on Lucas's neck. Over approximately 90 seconds, Lucas's lie-detection power crystallizes into a blue-green, fist-sized crystal, leaving him permanently depowered. Lucas screams during the process - described as not a scream of pain but of wrongness - and slumps afterward "like someone cut his strings." He is dumped at a Camden police station approximately two hours later, unconscious and restrained. He is subsequently found at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Camden (Room 347, secure wing), traumatized but not physically injured, with attorney Catherine Giuliano of Kline-Morrison present. Maya Richardson visits him that evening after receiving the Kingdom emergency call from Mr. Nothing. Mr. Antithesis arrives at a Port Richmond warehouse debrief and announces that Lucas will lose his "Mr. Polygraph" designation (a structural necessity, as the Kingdom's alphabetized system requires demonstrated superhuman capability) but maintain his salary, territory, and operational authority, pledging to personally coordinate Fly acquisition to restore his abilities. The operation results in 19 total arrests (4 Kingdom including Lucas, 15 Rogue Wave expendable foot soldiers), transforming Sam from a "tactical nuisance" to a "strategic problem" in the Kingdom's assessment.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Appears in the TF.3 interlude (Mr. Antithesis's POV) at Trent's office. Rechristened Mr. Preclude - formerly Mr. Polygraph, "reborn through Fly" - as of April 2nd. Assigned as Mr. Nothing's second-in-command in Philadelphia, handling enforcement, compliance, and personnel discipline while Nothing handles the operational architecture. Trent notes that Lucas is "different than the man I knew as Polygraph" - same frame, same face, but "something behind his eyes has been recalibrated" after months depowered and weeks in a cell. His charges were dropped because prosecution couldn't establish a connection between his hospital presence and criminal activity. Trent kept him on salary, covered his legal fees, and provided a selection of Fly compounds. Lucas's new power is described as "authoritative" compared to his former "observational" ability - he "makes rules" (Preclusion). Trent tells Chezki Espinosa that Lucas's loyalty was "purchased through demonstrated investment." Sat in the waiting room with Effie Dunham (Mrs. Zygote) during her interview and was visibly miserable - described as enduring "the hollow aftermath of prolonged social endurance." Effie waves at him on her way out and tells him to think about glial cells. He does not respond. Receives train tickets back to Philadelphia from Ophelia; Mr. Nothing will meet him at the station.
