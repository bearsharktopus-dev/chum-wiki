## Background

Lucas Donovan was born on September 15, 1985, in Trenton, New Jersey, to Victoria and Raymond Donovan. He grew up in a household characterized by dishonesty and maintained appearances, an environment that would prove formative in shaping both his temperament and his eventual relationship with his metahuman abilities. His power first manifested on June 17, 2001, during a family dinner when he experienced an itching sensation in his skull as his father lied about his whereabouts the previous night. This initial activation event tied Lucas's abilities directly to the domestic deceptions that defined his upbringing.

After relocating to Philadelphia in 2007, Lucas worked as a bartender, quietly using his nascent lie-detection abilities to identify patrons who were cheating or running scams. By 2010, he had drifted into organized crime, joining a small-time criminal gang where he earned the nickname "Polygraph" for his uncanny ability to identify deception. His powers proved invaluable during gang operations, most notably in 2012 when he uncovered a planned double-cross that saved the group from a disastrous outcome. When the gang disbanded following a major police crackdown in 2016, Lucas freelanced his interrogation services throughout Philadelphia's criminal underworld.

On October 31, 2019, Mr. Antithesis approached Lucas and offered him the role of lead interrogator for the newly forming Kingdom of Keys. Lucas accepted, formally adopting the designation "Mr. Polygraph" and cultivating a more professional appearance to align with the organization's corporate criminal ethos. As a founding member of the Kingdom, he became instrumental in vetting recruits, maintaining internal security, and conducting interrogations alongside his partner, Mr. Nothing (Darnell Hayes). The two operated as the Philadelphia branch's co-lead interrogators, a role that placed Lucas at the center of the Kingdom's intelligence operations for several years until his capture and depowering by Rogue Wave in late 2025.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Lie Detection (Spoken Word)** — Lucas possesses an extrasensory ability to determine whether someone is truthfully responding to a question he asks. When a subject speaks a falsehood, he experiences a distinct unpleasant twinge, referred to as a "ping," in the back of his skull. This ability functions regardless of physical proximity and operates over telephone calls, video calls, and any other medium that transmits spoken communication. The power detects subjective truth rather than objective reality, meaning it registers whether the speaker believes they are telling a falsehood rather than whether the statement is factually accurate. This nuance allows Lucas to identify individuals who are unknowingly spreading misinformation, as their genuine belief in the falsehood would not trigger a ping. Conversely, someone who believes they are lying but happens to state something factually true would still trigger the sensation.

### Limitations

- The ability requires spoken communication to function and is completely ineffective against written statements, non-verbal cues, or text-based deception.
- Clever wordplay, half-truths, and statements that are technically correct but misleading can circumvent the power, as the subjective belief component may not register these as falsehoods.
- The physical manifestation of the ping as a skull sensation can become distracting or overwhelming in environments where multiple lies are being told simultaneously, requiring significant mental discipline to manage during complex interrogations.
- Recorded playback of another person's voice does not trigger the power, as demonstrated during the Soot sting operation when the Auditors used Devonte's sound-replaying abilities to feed Kate's pre-recorded voice through Sam's mask, bypassing Lucas's detection entirely.
- Following his capture by Rogue Wave, Snake Oil extracted Lucas's lie-detection power through direct physical contact, crystallizing it into a blue-green substance over approximately 90 seconds. This left Lucas permanently depowered. As of the beginning of Arc 16, Mr. Antithesis is actively hunting Fly to provide Lucas with a replacement power, and it is implied he has re-acquired a new ability, though its nature has not yet been revealed.

### Training & Skills

- One of the best marksmen in the Kingdom of Keys among members whose powers do not enhance their aim. He is consistently described as a crack shot with firearms.
- Excellent chess player, reflecting his strategic intelligence and capacity for anticipating opponents' moves.
- Genuinely intelligent, capable of running complex interrogations that blend psychological pressure with his supernatural abilities.
- Skilled in intimidation and psychological manipulation, employing threats of extreme violence (such as Yakuza-style finger removal) to extract compliance even without using his power.
- Practiced meditator, using breathing techniques to manage his anger issues and maintain composure during high-pressure interrogations.
- Experienced in impersonating law enforcement, having successfully posed as NSRA Agent Parker with fabricated credentials during the Hatboro-Horsham investigation.

## Personality

Lucas Donovan presents as professional and controlled, maintaining a composed exterior that belies significant anger management issues simmering beneath the surface. He is impulsive in his thinking but disciplined in his actions, possessing the self-awareness to lid his volatile impulses most of the time. When that lid slips, the results are explosive: he has been observed firing his gun into machinery in frustration, breaking a subordinate's nose as a substitute for cutting off his finger, and escalating confrontations beyond what the tactical situation requires. His rage appears rooted in a deep-seated frustration with dishonesty, a trait likely exacerbated by a power that forces him to confront untruths constantly.

In his professional capacity, Lucas is direct, authoritative, and comfortable exercising lethal force. He executed a suspected informant with two gunshots during a recruitment meeting on Halloween to silence dissent and demonstrate consequences. He assigned Aaron McKinley to kill Bloodhound as casually as delegating a work task. Yet he is not purely sadistic; he simply operates within the Kingdom's framework of criminal pragmatism, treating violence as a business tool rather than a source of personal pleasure. Outside of work, Lucas is described as someone who simply has his life and lives it, with interests in classic detective novels, jazz music, poker, and a collection of vintage polygraph machines that reflects his respect for the tradition of lie detection.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Darnell Hayes (Mr. Nothing) | Partner / Close friend | Co-lead interrogator and operational partner for the Philadelphia branch. The two form an inseparable duo described as "heterosexual life mates," despite having met only relatively recently through the Kingdom. They complement each other tactically: Lucas provides intelligence-gathering through lie detection while Darnell provides power nullification in the field. |
| Trent Fairfax (Mr. Antithesis) | Superior / Benefactor | Leader of the Kingdom of Keys who recruited Lucas as a founding member in 2019. Following Lucas's depowering, Mr. Antithesis personally undertook a campaign to acquire Fly to restore Lucas's abilities, demonstrating the organization's investment in his value. |
| Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Colleague | Acting boss of the Philadelphia branch. Maya coordinated Lucas's legal representation following his arrest and visited him in the hospital after his depowering. She assigned him and Mr. Nothing to oversee Hypeman production coordination with Mrs. Xenograft. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary | Teenage vigilante who became Lucas's most persistent antagonist. Their encounters escalated from the Dobson Factory confrontation through the NSRA impersonation to the Soot sting, culminating in Sam orchestrating the tip that led to his capture and depowering by Rogue Wave. |
| Aaron McKinley (The Coyote) | Subordinate | Low-level criminal whom Lucas intimidated and then assigned to assassinate Bloodhound as repayment for lost Kingdom funds. |
| Blake Matthews (Mr. Tyrannosaur) | Colleague | Kingdom enforcer. Lucas socialized with him outside of operations, inviting him to a strip club after a Kingdom meeting, and the two met jointly with Aaron McKinley to collect debts. |
| Maria Valdez (Mrs. Heartbeat) | Colleague | Kingdom assassin and medic who accompanied Lucas during the Halloween warehouse recruitment meeting and the zoo heist operation. |

Interrogates a captive about connections to Liberty Belle while overseeing Mudslide's loyalty test, which results in the captive's murder. Discovers Sam Small and Jordan Westwood observing from the catwalks. Interrogates Sam at gunpoint, revealing his lie-detection abilities and threatening to shoot her if she lies. Fires his gun wildly in frustration when Sam bluffs about streaming audio, allowing the teens to escape. Engages in a brutal fight in Chapter 13, during which Sam bites his shoulder and punches him repeatedly. Appears in drone footage presented to the Delaware Valley Defenders as evidence of Kingdom criminal activity. |
| Book 2: Keys | Mentioned | Referenced as a subject in the drone footage shown to the adult Delaware Valley Defenders by the Young Defenders team. The footage of the Dobson Factory murder becomes key evidence identifying the Kingdom of Keys as a criminal organization. |
| Book 3: Dybbuk | Supporting | Leads the Halloween night recruitment meeting at the Kingdom warehouse on Trenton Avenue alongside Mrs. Heartbeat. Addresses recruits, explains the initiation test requiring them to convert stolen goods into $20,000 by mid-December, and threatens to shoot any undercover officers. Executes a suspected informant with two gunshots (one to the head, one to the chest) to demonstrate the consequences of betrayal. This event is witnessed by Sam, Jordan, Jamila, and Spinelli, who are hiding inside the warehouse. Video footage of his address is later presented to the Delaware Valley Defenders as evidence. Referenced in Sam's thoughts during subsequent chapters as a looming threat. |
| Book 4: Exorcism | Supporting | Appears in the AMK.1 interlude alongside Mr. Tyrannosaur. Summons Aaron McKinley to demand repayment of lost Kingdom funds. Threatens to cut off Aaron's pinky finger in a Yakuza-style punishment, terrorizing him with a knife before instead breaking his nose with a punch. Reveals that the Kingdom has identified "Wolf" as Bloodhound, a junior cape interfering with their operations. Assigns Aaron to kill Bloodhound as a means of redeeming himself. Appears in Chapter 57 posing as NSRA Agent Parker alongside Mr. ESP (Agent Evans) at the Hatboro-Horsham NSRA crime scene. His arm shows injuries from his previous encounter with Sam. Interrogates the teens about their presence, growing increasingly specific and suspicious. Triggers Spindle's recognition by using the word "fruitful" from their Halloween encounter. Sam deliberately lies to trigger his powers and test his reactions. Falters when Sam questions his specific reference to abandoned buildings, confirming Kingdom surveillance of their activities. Pulled away by Agent Evans after the confrontation escalates. Photograph taken by Sam becomes evidence of Kingdom members impersonating federal officers. Later shown in video evidence to NSRA Agent Torres during intelligence sharing. |
| Book 5: Mayfly | Supporting (Interlude) | Appears in the BM.1 interlude (Mr. Tyrannosaur's POV) at a Kingdom leadership meeting. Arrives visibly injured from a recent assault by Fly-powered attackers ("gutter punks"). Reports on the emergence of the Fly drug and its implications. References the recent Chernobyl/Fedorov failure. Treats his injuries at the first aid station. Invites Mr. Tyrannosaur to unwind at a strip club afterward, and they depart Kingdom headquarters together in a Cadillac. |
| Book 7: Security | Mentioned | Referenced in discussions about the Kingdom's potential interest in the Philadelphia Zoo and their operational planning. His role as interrogator is part of the broader Kingdom threat assessment during Arc 7. |
| Book 8: Big | Mentioned | Not directly present during the zoo heist (Operation Ivory), which was led by Mr. Nothing, Mrs. Heartbeat, Mudslide, and Mr. Tyrannosaur. Referenced as part of the Kingdom's operational structure during the arc's events. Mr. Nothing and Mudslide are captured at the conclusion of the zoo battle. |
| Book 10: Plume | Supporting (Interlude) | Assigned by Maya Richardson alongside Mr. Nothing to coordinate with Mrs. Xenograft on rebuilding Hypeman production in Camden, as detailed in the MR.7 interlude following the Soot sting operation. Part of the strategic planning discussion at the Kingdom safehouse regarding Rogue Wave's silence and anti-vigilante legislation expansion. |
| Book 11: Alarm Will Sound | Supporting | Present during the Soot sting operation (the Washes operation) alongside Mr. Retribution, Mrs. Quiet, and Mr. Nothing. Arrives at Lardner's Point Park and offers $2,000 to the Washes for first interrogation rights. Questions the disguised Sam about her knowledge of the Trenton Avenue warehouse. Demands to see "Soot's" face to confirm identity, threatening to expose the entire deception. His lie-detection powers are bypassed during the interrogation because Sam was not actually speaking; Devonte's sound-replaying ability was feeding Kate's pre-recorded voice through the mask. A police siren diversion prevents him from unmasking Sam. |
| Book 15: Severe Weather Warning | Supporting | Captured in the Rogue Wave operation at Roxborough Memorial Hospital. Sam tips off Rogue Wave about the Kingdom's evidence disposal, and Monkey Business correctly predicts Lucas's involvement. Lucas and Mr. Nothing arrive to investigate, where they are ambushed by Rogue Wave's combat team (Rush Order, Birthday Suit, Dead Drop). Rush Order captures Lucas, and he is transported to a secondary location in Camden where Snake Oil performs the power extraction, placing his hand on Lucas's neck after administering local anesthetic. Over 90 seconds, Lucas's lie-detection power materializes as a blue-green crystal, leaving him permanently depowered. Rogue Wave tips police about his location 45 minutes later. He is found at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Camden, traumatized but physically unharmed, with attorney Catherine Giuliano present. Maya Richardson visits him that evening. Mr. Antithesis subsequently announces that Lucas will lose his "Mr. Polygraph" designation but maintain his salary, territory, and operational authority, pledging to acquire Fly to restore his abilities. The operation results in 19 total arrests, including Lucas, transforming Sam from a "tactical nuisance" to a "strategic problem" in the Kingdom's assessment. |
| Book 16: Category Five Hurricane | Mentioned | Referenced as going through the legal system following his arrest. Mr. Antithesis is personally involved in hunting Rogue Wave to acquire Fly for Lucas's re-powering. It is implied that Lucas has re-acquired a new power, though its nature has not been revealed. |
