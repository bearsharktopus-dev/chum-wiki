## Background

Niles Nolan grew up in Chester County, Pennsylvania, the son of a retired conservative judge. He dropped out of medical school to attend art school, then dropped out of art school as well - an education that gave him an unsettling combination of anatomical knowledge and creative sadism.

Between 2009 and 2010, Nolan carried out a series of brutal attacks in Strawberry Mansion under the alias Shrike, named after the Laniidae "butcher birds" known for impaling prey on thorns and barbed wire. He targeted families in their homes, trapping residents with spike powers while ostensibly stealing copper wiring - though Liberty Belle's investigation determined the thefts were cover for his true purpose of arranging suffering as art. Five people were killed: four civilians and Officer James Martinez of the PPD. His victims were predominantly young women tortured with metal spikes grown from everyday objects.

Nolan was subdued by Liberty Belle (then Breakout) and Professor Franklin in a Strawberry Mansion rowhome (Interlude DW.1). Franklin's electrical abilities disrupted Nolan's spike generation. He was convicted on multiple counts of murder and received multiple life sentences without parole, transferred from Eastern State to Daedalus Correctional Facility. Belle advocated for rehabilitation programs during his incarceration, but budget cuts dismantled them and Daedalus conditions deteriorated.

After approximately fifteen years in Daedalus, Nolan escaped during the September 2025 breach orchestrated by the Kingdom of Keys and Red Calf - one of the "Magnificent Seven." He returned to Philadelphia specifically targeting Bloodhound, whom he viewed as Belle's successor. He established a base in the abandoned Metropolitan Opera House, attracted a following of neo-Nazi skinheads, and carried out an escalating campaign of terror across Northeast Philadelphia before breaking into the Small family home to deliver an ultimatum for a formal confrontation. He was killed during that confrontation at the Van Kirk and James construction site, dying approximately one hour after hospitalization from accumulated injuries, blood loss, and the effects of Hypeman.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Metallokinetic Spike Generation** - Could grow black metal spikes with reddish undertones from any metal object or surface containing metal, including walls, floors, ceilings, brick, and dirt. Spikes emerged rapidly (half a meter in half a second) and ranged from small thorns to massive structural protrusions. Growth was accompanied by a distinctive humming, hissing, and popping sound. Spikes disintegrated into floating black metallic particles when Nolan lost concentration or consciousness.
- **Environmental Control** - Primary combat strategy was transforming open spaces into deadly mazes of interlocking spikes, creating corridors, walls, blind spots, and kill zones. Could direct spike growth with precision and channel spikes through his feet, not just his hands.
- **Spike Weaponry** - Modified a metal drawer slide into an improvised pickaxe by growing a six-inch spike from its end. Fought in a style alternating between fencing jabs and baseball-bat swings.
- **Automated Spike Triggers** - Claimed the ability to seed "spike embryos" in structures that would activate on preset conditions (heartbeat stopping, restraint, timer). His claim to have seeded the Small home was confirmed to be a bluff, though tactically effective.
- **Hypeman Enhancement** - Took Hypeman during the final confrontation, gaining enhanced physical strength sufficient to break free from NSRA containment and snap handcuff chains. Fought with raw, prison-yard brutality rather than elaborate spike tactics while under its influence.

### Limitations

- **Cannot Spike Through Living Tissue** - Nolan could only generate spikes where there was open air or existing material. He could not grow spikes through a living body directly, only around or toward it. Sam identified this limitation during their fight.
- **Fatigue-Dependent** - As Nolan tired, his spikes weakened and became less responsive. Extended combat degraded his ability to maintain spike fields.
- **Electrical Disruption** - Professor Franklin's electrical abilities disrupted Nolan's power during their original confrontation, interfering with his ability to generate or control spikes. Consistent voltage appeared to be particularly effective.
- **Physical Frailty** - Despite his powers, Nolan was physically fragile - described as tall, angular, and spindly. He relied almost entirely on his spikes for defense and could be overwhelmed in close-quarters combat by a sufficiently aggressive opponent.

### Training & Skills

- Partial medical school education provided anatomical knowledge he applied to targeting vulnerable areas.
- Art school background informed his approach to arranging displays and creating elaborate installations.
- Skilled at constructing improvised traps using mundane materials - tripwires, chemical aerosol cans, bucket traps, and dental floss triggers.
- Demonstrated talent for psychological manipulation, stalking, and information gathering. He identified Sam's real name, her parents' names, and her Jewish heritage before confronting her.
- Strategic thinker who used press releases, media manipulation, and his follower network to control the narrative around his confrontation with Bloodhound.

## Personality

Nolan was a deeply antisemitic, white supremacist serial killer who combined a veneer of intellectual sophistication with sadistic cruelty. He wore a red armband bearing a hand-painted Iron Cross and explicitly targeted Sam's Jewish heritage, using slurs like "mongrel," "mutt," and "plague rat." He referred to his violent displays as "art" and approached his crimes with a methodical, performance-oriented mindset - sending press releases to media before confrontations and framing encounters as public spectacles.

His demeanor oscillated between unsettling calm and explosive, shrieking outbursts. His voice was abnormally deep for his thin frame but would jump from baritone to soprano when agitated. He rarely fully closed his lips and had a tendency to drool during rants. Despite his posturing, he crumbled when confronted with genuine physical threat - whimpering and assuming a fetal position when subdued by Belle and Franklin. Dr. Necrosis dismissed him as a "sloppy" imitator who used ideology as a costume.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Antagonist (Interlude DW.1)

    Appears in a flashback interlude from Diane Williams's perspective, during her early career as Breakout. Responding to Priority 1 violent incidents in Strawberry Mansion, Breakout discovers rowhomes fortified with jet-black metallic spike protrusions and a family of three - father, mother, and young girl - trapped in an intricate lattice of spikes. Shrike is described as well-dressed with wild blonde hair and a blood-soaked cloth mask, stealing copper wiring while holding the family hostage. Breakout engages in extended combat, during which Shrike herds her into a corner using spike walls and traps her in an iron maiden configuration. Professor Franklin arrives and incapacitates Shrike with an electrical discharge to the neck. Nolan is taken into custody, with Franklin revealing knowledge of his first name. The interlude establishes Breakout and Franklin's mentorship dynamic in its aftermath.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Primary antagonist

    Sam discovers Shrike's history through Liberty Belle's notebooks while cataloging them for the library. Simultaneously, a wave of dead birds impaled on sharp objects begins spreading across Northeast Philadelphia neighborhoods - Mayfair, Tacony, Holmesburg, Bridesburg, Oxford Circle, Bustleton, and Somerton - one new neighborhood per day. The escalation continues with an elaborate mannequin display at the Ascension of Our Lord church in Kensington, a barbed-wire hostage (Mack Gallagher) in a dumpster on Amber Street, and the impalement of a bloodhound dog at the Frankford and Knorr ShopRite with the message "WHERE ARE YOU?" Police publicly identify the perpetrator as Niles Nolan, 39, escaped Daedalus inmate, one of the Magnificent Seven. The arc culminates with Shrike's 3:17 AM home invasion of the Small residence, where he demonstrates knowledge of Sam's real identity and Jewish heritage, threatens her parents' reproductive organs, claims to have seeded the house with spike embryos, and delivers his ultimatum for a formal confrontation before escaping via a spike staircase grown from the house's exterior.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter In Place"

    **Role:** Primary antagonist (Chapters 204-209), posthumous presence (210-218)

    The arc opens with the Small family evacuating to the Auditors' Music Hall headquarters. Sam negotiates Rogue Wave protection for her family, then plans an offensive response. After leaving an invitation at the Metropolitan Opera House and surviving chemical traps there, Sam confronts Shrike at the Van Kirk and James construction site. Shrike arrives in a formal brown suit with an Iron Cross armband, transforms the site into a spike maze, and engages Sam in extended combat. He sent press releases beforehand, framing the encounter as a public spectacle, and his 15-20 skinhead followers form a perimeter. Sam defeats him after a grueling fight, and he is taken into NSRA custody. When his followers provoke a gunfight with police, Shrike breaks free, takes Hypeman, and initiates a second round of even more brutal combat. Sam enters a berserker state with full-body Instant Armor and ultimately puts Shrike down by biting through his forearm and delivering a final clothesline strike. Shrike dies approximately one hour after hospitalization. His death reverberates through the rest of the arc: Sam is hospitalized with catastrophic injuries, announces her retirement from the Bloodhound identity, enters therapy for nightmares about the fight, and the anti-powered extremist group the Songbirds emerges roughly two weeks after his death - with speculation that they may be a rebranded offshoot of his follower base, as "a shrike is a kind of songbird."

??? warning "Extra: Powered Perspectives"

    **Role:** Referenced

    Discussed in a Philadelphia Inquirer article by Dr. May Westwood dated September 24, 2025, examining the relationship between superhuman art and criminal violence. The article firmly rejects categorizing Shrike's displays as art, with art historian Dr. Vanessa Powell noting his work demonstrates "a startling poverty of imagination" and "obviousness masquerading as profundity, shock value substituting for substance."

??? warning "Extra: Interlude DT.3"

    **Role:** Referenced

    Referenced in a Cape Watch Philly blog post speculating about changes to the Bloodhound identity. Multiple observers note that Bloodhound has returned to active duty barely one month after sustaining catastrophic injuries during the Shrike fight, fueling speculation that a new individual has assumed the identity.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: THIS SIDE UP"

    **Role:** Referenced (Interlude FF.1)

    Mentioned in a TIME Magazine interview with Dr. Necrosis (Felix Fleischer), who dismisses Shrike and similar criminals as "sloppy" imitators who use ideology as a costume. Fleischer distinguishes between using fear as a tool and being a fearful thing, categorizing Shrike among those who "escalate past the point of usefulness because they cannot stop themselves."

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Referenced

    Tasha Reynolds's research into the Songbirds reveals that the group's founder, Mike D'Ambrosio, had no anti-powered presence before October 2025 - approximately two weeks after Shrike's death. Tasha raises the possibility that the Songbirds are a rebranded offshoot of Shrike's follower base, noting that "a Shrike is a kind of songbird."

## Trivia

- Sam connected Nolan's alias to the Laniidae "butcher birds" after an ornithologist on a news broadcast discussed shrike caching behavior.
- Sam's comment about his father putting kids in juvenile detention visibly struck a nerve during their confrontation.
- Of the Magnificent Seven Daedalus escapees, Shrike was the first to die. Others were recaptured, killed by police, surrendered, or remain at large.
- During the home invasion, Nolan wore boxing gloves with vinyl doctor's gloves underneath, suggesting forensic awareness despite his theatrical behavior.
- The Metropolitan Opera House held a ministry on its first floor and the opera house proper on the upper floors. Nolan set up improvised traps using mundane materials rather than his powers, possibly indicating a limitation in spike embryo maintenance or a preference for conserving his abilities.
- Drone footage of the Van Kirk fight was leaked and played on news channels continuously. The District Attorney declined to press charges against Sam, calling it "political suicide."
- The anti-powered extremist group the Songbirds emerged roughly two weeks after his death, with possible connections to his remaining follower base - "a shrike is a kind of songbird."
