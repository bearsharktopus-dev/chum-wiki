## Background

Joshua Pleasants is a metahuman from Boston whose powers activated at the moment of his death - a Post-Mortem Activation (PMA) - leaving him in a perpetual state of decay and regeneration. He is, by all practical definitions, a walking corpse that cannot die again. His heart barely beats, his blood has coagulated into sludge, and his body continuously produces toxic decomposition gases that he contains with a neon-yellow hazmat suit and skeletal mask. His appearance is gaunt and mummified, his voice tinny and forced through a shredded throat.

Pleasants studied science education at Towson University, intending to become a chemistry teacher. Diagnosed with fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) at age 22, he traveled to Mammoth Lakes, California to die on his own terms in a CO2-venting volcanic cave. Instead, he survived - his body adapted to not require oxygen, and his regeneration outpaced the prion disease, rebuilding his brain faster than CJD could destroy it. DAAS specialists diagnosed his condition as "arrested decomposition" and provided containment equipment. Two months later, he began vigilante work in Baltimore, where he met Breakout (later known as Liberty Belle) during a convenience store robbery - the first person to voluntarily spend time with him after his condition became apparent. He adopted the codename Miasma during their first conversation.

After building a decade-long vigilante career in Boston, Pleasants came to Philadelphia for Liberty Belle's funeral in December 2023. Named a beneficiary of her will, he remained in the city to continue her investigations, becoming an early ally and mentor to Sam Small. He intervened when NSRA agents tried to confiscate Belle's materials (Book 4), helped form the Auditors as an off-the-books investigative team, and solo-infiltrated the NSRA's Hatboro-Horsham office. The Kingdom of Keys subsequently framed him for four guard murders at that facility, triggering a citywide manhunt. Later, he joined Argus Corps as a covert mole to work against Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) from within, eventually helping Sam expose Richardson's Kingdom ties by capturing her shapeshifter double (Book 15).

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **High-Grade Regeneration** - Practically unkillable without depowering. Surface wounds heal in approximately fifteen seconds. His regeneration rebuilt his brain from CJD-induced destruction, replacing neural tissue faster than the prion disease could damage it. His body exists in perpetual decay-and-recycling equilibrium, sustaining biological function at the minimum viable threshold. Has survived headshot wounds.
- **Pain Immunity / Overexertion Tolerance** - Does not experience pain, allowing him to exert his muscles at full capacity without lactic acid buildup. This makes him appear stronger than he actually is.
- **Respiratory Independence** - Does not require oxygen. His lungs function mechanically (allowing speech) but do not perform gas exchange.
- **Toxic Gas Production** - His decomposing body continuously generates noxious gases contained within his hazmat suit. Can release them tactically to flood enclosed spaces and incapacitate opponents.
- **Firebomb Improvisation** - Can recycle and compress his own decomposition gases to create improvised incendiary devices.

### Limitations

- Cannot build muscle mass; regeneration reverts any gains, keeping his body at a fixed decay-renewal equilibrium.
- Decomposition stench makes stealth and social interaction extremely difficult; requires hazmat suit at all times.
- His rotting condition has destroyed his sense of smell and prevents him from tasting anything subtle. Relies on strongly flavored foods (kimchi, hot sauce, pickled jalapenos) for sensory experience.
- Depowering would presumably be fatal, as his body depends entirely on regeneration to sustain function.
- Heart rate of approximately eight to twelve BPM; blood coagulated into pudding-like sludge. Circulatory and digestive systems are practically inert - regeneration bypasses normal metabolic pathways.
- Toxic byproducts (ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane, volatile organic compounds) accumulate in tissues and vent through skin and breath, producing his incapacitating stench.

### Training & Skills

- Extensively self-educated across criminal justice, international relations, metahuman law, geopolitics, philosophy (Bentham, Mill), psychology, game theory, and legal theory. Maintains annotated personal libraries at his safehouses. Keeps no fiction.
- Skilled interrogator and proficient in real-time legal strategy.
- Rigorous operational security: maintains multiple safehouses across cities, rotates locations, uses burner phones, and compartmentalizes information.
- Experienced in long-term covert operations, having maintained his Argus Corps mole cover since the team's formation.

## Personality

Pleasants is a self-described curmudgeon whose abrasive exterior predates his powers - his abilities simply made the outside match the inside. He approaches the world through a rationalist lens, favoring Bayesian probability and utilitarian calculus. Strongly anti-government as a matter of principle, he views institutional power with deep skepticism. Despite this framework, he is not cold: he maintains a seven-year engagement, a wide circle of friends, and genuine investment in those he protects.

His response to his CJD diagnosis (Interlude JP.2) exemplifies his pragmatism - processing the news through data rather than emotion, spending two weeks on "administrative" preparation for death, then choosing to die on his own terms in California rather than decline into a vegetative state. When his Activation Event robbed him of that choice, his reaction was bitter laughter at the absurdity of gaining immortality only to keep dying in a different way.

Intellectual rigor is his defining trait. Unable to exercise or socialize conventionally, he devotes enormous time to reading and can contextualize local events within global patterns of metahuman politics. He is pragmatic to a fault - willing to propose plans with collateral damage that horrify his younger allies - but capable of deferring to their ethical objections. He compared Sam to Liberty Belle, noting the same "particular kind of insanity" that drives people to care about systemic injustice, describing that drive as "the flu" that makes people become superheroes.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Named as a beneficiary in Liberty Belle's will during the reading, receiving keys to a personal lockbox and its contents (Ch. 46). Attended Belle's funeral at Laurel Hill East cemetery wrapped in hazmat equipment with a tie loosely around the neck of the hood; Sam almost snickered at the combination. Delivered the first eulogy - a raw, emotional speech with no pleasantries or introductions, his voice tinny and retch-like, forced through a shredded throat (Ch. 47). Revealed Belle's origin: "In 2005, when the world came crashing down in a subway tunnel, it didn't break her. It forged her, in blood and dust and darkness." Intervened when NSRA agents tried to confiscate Belle's materials from Sam at Lily Chen's house (Ch. 48), arguing Fourth Amendment protections and calling Laura Zhang to confirm the agents had lied about having authorization. Brought Sam to his temporary base at an abandoned concrete pier near the Betsy Ross Bridge. Helped Sam interpret evidence of Chernobyl's government protection and proposed assembling a team to investigate. Davis subsequently designated Pleasants as "adult supervision" for the off-the-books "Young Defenders Dark" initiative (Ch. 49). Met with Sam, Jordan, and Spindle at the Tacony Music Hall (Ch. 54), where he clashed with them over the ethics of his proposed NSRA raid - calling them "you idealistic little pigs" and "you squeamish little babies" - but ultimately suggested the team name "The Auditors." Almost gassed Jordan's visiting mother (hand on containment suit zipper) and threatened to rot out the ceiling onto her, but backed down, went to get Wawa when told to, and later tailed the woman home. Conducted the solo infiltration of the NSRA's Hatboro-Horsham office. On January 20, 2024, the Kingdom framed him for the murder of four security guards at the facility (Ch. 56). An NBC10 news broadcast detailed his backstory: born Boston 1987, Towson University, Post-Mortem Activation, met Breakout in Baltimore. Security footage showed him examining files but did not show any direct acts of violence. The citywide manhunt continued for weeks, with vigilantes from other cities joining the search.

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam follows Pleasants' legal case from her hospital bed during recovery, feeling guilty about his situation. She tells her visitors: "Joshua Pleasants, that smelly corpse guy. He's innocent. The Kingdom framed him." She has footage on her phone and asks them to send it to Multiplex and talk to Agent Torres to clear his name.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Remains a fugitive. The citywide manhunt continues, with out-of-city vigilantes joining the search. A separate NSRA break-in occurs at Hatboro-Horsham - a different person, caught this time.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Recruited by Maya Richardson into Argus Corps during a sterile coworking space meeting (Interlude MR.4). He arrived ten minutes late in his hazmat suit and skeletal mask, sat far from Patriot, and told Maya: "I'm here because I have no better options." Maya appealed to his pragmatism, framing the Jump cleanup as a necessary evil - though Pleasants joined as a covert mole to work against the Kingdom from within. Listed in the confidential Argus Corps formation proposal (Interlude MR.5) as a "regenerative strategist, chemical warfare deterrence" asset. All four founding members were LUMA-suspended heroes reinstated under the LUMA Reformation Initiative. Publicly presented as a founding member of Argus Corps alongside Patriot, Turbo Jett, and Captain Devil at Richardson's emergency city council press conference announcing the team's "preemptive deterrence" strategy (Ch. 160). The Auditors found his involvement baffling - he was previously known as an anti-corruption crusader, now teamed with Patriot, whom he should ideologically oppose (Ch. 161). During the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse confrontation (Ch. 163-164), entered in his yellow hazmat suit and skeletal mask, emanating a sharp acrid smell of rot and bleach. His stated job was "to avoid collateral damage... here to look good for Maya." When Sam rounded a corner and nearly slammed into him, Miasma stared at her, then deliberately turned around and pretended he had not seen her - a significant early signal of his true allegiance.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Continues operating within Argus Corps. Not directly featured.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present during an Argus Corps team briefing in the underground training room, where Patriot briefed the team on Sam's accusations against Richardson. Captain Devil's Interlude AM.1 describes Miasma as a "cross-legged reader" who was "perceptive, cryptic" and had a known connection to Liberty Belle. His reaction to the briefing was noted as "suspiciously neutral." Afterward, Miasma privately warned Patriot: "Be careful with Richardson. Power corrupts. So does fear." Captain Devil separately noted that Miasma had become "different lately. More distant." Captain Devil and Turbo Jett were conducting their own secret investigation of Tremont & Fairfax and Richardson's background, operating independently of Miasma's parallel mole operation.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Continues operating within Argus Corps while the team hunts Shrike and provides security during anti-vigilante legislation hearings. Not directly featured.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Major

    Revealed as a mole within Argus Corps. When Sam fled from Patriot and Turbo Jett's arrest attempt (Ch. 223), Pleasants appeared in an alley wearing his full fluorescent yellow hazmat suit - Sam's blood sense detected only a "person-shaped absence" with no blood signature. He gave her terse directions to a safehouse ("third building down, southwest corner, basement access, red triangle on next house") and radioed a false report to Argus Corps: "Target headed toward Frankford Avenue. In pursuit." His safehouse was an abandoned row home basement stocked with a dehumidifier, sleeping bag, camping stove, water bottles, strong-flavor foods (hot sauce, kimchi, pickled jalapenos), a battery lantern, first aid kit, and his personal library. He returned approximately two hours later, then burned the safehouse for security. He maintained a network of four safehouses in Philadelphia, six in Boston, and two in New York, with a bug-out tunnel behind a bookshelf and internal locks on the basement door. Each safehouse included a burner phone in the first aid kit with two emergency numbers.

    During Sam's fugitive period, Pleasants served as her handler and operational support. He rotated her between safehouses every two days (Bridesburg storage unit, Kensington basement, Frankford abandoned office), provided swimming goggles for camera concealment, provided operational funds in ziplock bags labeled "Operational funds. Don't get robbed," and supplied a heavy bag for her boxing conditioning. He helped Sam deduce the existence of a Kingdom shapeshifter ("Alice") responsible for framing both of them, connecting three known impersonation instances: his own frame-up, Sam's frame-up, and Maya's absence at Harrisburg. He provided Crossroads power analysis, describing Crossroads's ability as creating "closed timelike curves in information space" - retrocausality, not prediction. He forced Sam to take a break on day eight when she became sloppy, telling her that her brain was at 98% capacity. He checked on her supplies regularly, tracked whether she was injured or compromised, and told her to eat more: "You're burning calories faster than you're replacing them." He also relayed intelligence from inside Argus Corps, texting "Pieces moving. Stay ready," and later "Ready when you are" and "Good luck" before the final operation. He reported from Maya's all-hands meeting that the Inquirer article was about to drop and that Maya wanted Argus Corps diverted to Northeast Philadelphia to "keep the peace" - to which he responded "Sure."

    During the operation to capture Alice (Ch. 232), Pleasants texted Sam the location (Frankford & Rowland) and was positioned at the scene leaning against an unmarked car behind the Argus Corps SUV, arms crossed, "looking bored." When Captain Devil ordered "Miasma, you cover Maya," Pleasants opened the car door for Alice-as-Maya and said "Get in." Alice complied - as the real Maya would have - and Pleasants drove off with her. He texted Sam afterward: "Package secure. En route to secondary location. You okay?" and "Take your time. She's not going anywhere."

    In Interlude JP.1, Pleasants interrogated Alice at a Fishtown safehouse - a two-bedroom apartment owned by a shell company tracing back to Argus Corps through four intermediaries, used twice before. He had been wearing his hazmat suit for over six hours and was reading "Erta Ale" by an Ethiopian geologist, a book recommended by Belle. He laid out three theories and confronted her on the legal consequences of impersonating a public official. When her handler called, he had her answer on speaker, recognizing the coded spy speak. He pivoted to a simple demand: confirm whether the woman in front of him was or was not Maya Richardson. He got Elena Morales on camera confessing her identity as a shapeshifter, promising the footage would go to the Inquirer. He knew she was lying about working for Rogue Wave rather than the Kingdom, but the confession itself was the prize - burning Maya's alibi was the goal. He texted Sam: "She's cooperating. Blaming Rogue Wave. Doesn't matter. Alibi's burned." He volunteered as Sam's guard during her subsequent police custody, at the cordon maintaining his cover but nodding to Sam. He referred to himself as Sam's "psychopomp" - a guide between states - and advised her to return to normal life after the charges dropped: "Strategic commitment, not tactical commitment."

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** POV (Interlude JP.2)

    Full origin story. Diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease at age 22 by Dr. Kessler in Boston. Informed his parents and sister, then traveled to Mammoth Lakes, California, intending to die by CO2 asphyxiation in a volcanic cave. On day twelve, entered the cave and lost consciousness, but survived over thirty minutes in a lethal atmosphere - his Activation Event. Discovered rapid regeneration upon emerging (wounds healing in fifteen seconds). Returned to Boston, where testing revealed the CJD was initially still progressing but his brain was simultaneously regenerating, creating new tissue faster than the prions could destroy it. Hospitalized for seizures starting eleven days after his return; experienced memory loss, confusion, and temporary inability to recognize his mother. By day eighteen, protein markers dropped and the CJD was outpaced by regeneration. On day twenty-three, hospital chemical sensors detected toxic gases emanating from his body, leading to a full assessment by DAAS and Aurora Springs specialists who diagnosed "arrested decomposition." Discharged with a hazmat suit and registered metahuman documentation. Two months later, began vigilante operations in Baltimore, where he stopped an armed robbery (absorbing a gunshot center-mass without meaningful injury), met the vigilante Breakout, and adopted the codename Miasma.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Continues operating within Argus Corps while coordinating with Sam on the broader campaign against Maya Richardson. When Sam texted him intelligence about the Bellwether district drug operation (Ch. 237), Miasma responded: "Interesting. Will look into it." Sam counted Miasma and Argus Corps as one of several channels she activated alongside the Pattinson's Pals, Davis and the DVD, and the Tacony Titans. When Mr. Nothing intercepted Sam on the Broad Street Line subway (Ch. 246), threatening her with a screwdriver, Miasma coordinated Argus Corps backup: Captain Devil was already positioned nearby, Turbo Jett was being rerouted, and Miasma himself was intercepting the train. Patriot arrived on the platform to confront Nothing directly, saving Sam.

    Conspicuously absent from the Argus Corps Oversight Transition meeting at City Hall (Interlude MR.10), where Maya's civilian oversight of the team was being transferred to a broader council committee under Davis's coalition. Maya internally assessed that she was 99% sure Miasma had turned on her - that he had helped Sam avoid consequences and that she was 90% sure he had planned the Doppelganger operation to expose her. She reflected: "That's the problem with building a weapon. Eventually, it develops opinions about who it should be pointed at." As the arc closes, Maya has resigned from City Council and Argus Corps oversight has transitioned to a new committee structure, removing the primary lever Miasma was exploiting from within.


## Trivia

- Eliezer Yudkowsky was never born in the story's timeline, so the real-world rationalist movement does not exist, though Pleasants arrived at similar Bayesian/utilitarian conclusions independently.
- His personal expenses are minimal: rent paid annually, approximately one hundred dollars per month on food. Leaves cash for Sam in ziplock bags labeled "Operational funds. Don't get robbed."
- A controversial 2018 raid in Lowell, Massachusetts was cited as the most notable incident in his earlier Boston career.
- His situation is "not a tragedy" - he would be living the same way without powers; he is simply unkillable now.
- Sam once awkwardly misinterpreted his "corpse paint" comment as a sex joke, when he was actually referencing a makeup subculture.
- PMA produces powers far stronger than ordinary activation, with the body locked into a "template" of its physical state at the moment of activation.
- DAAS specialists noted his sperm count remained viable, making IVF a theoretical possibility despite his otherwise non-functional biological systems.
- Breakout did not step back or gag upon seeing his ruptured suit; her first critique was that he was "monologuing."
- Interlude JP.2's opening and closing passages are framed by song lyrics. During the rage sequence before entering the cave, the thought attributed to him: "Nobody wants to be born, enter the rat race, and then just drop dead."
- When first meeting the teenage Auditors, he told them: "I'm doing this for Diane. Not for you three."
- His campsite at the abandoned pier included oil drums and glass chemistry equipment, suggesting he had been refining his decomposition gases for tactical use.
- Referred to himself as "Boston's Batman."
- Sam's blood sense perceives Pleasants as a "person-shaped absence" - his blood thick like jelly and black, his body fermenting - making him effectively invisible to her usual detection ability.
