??? warning "Background"

    Joshua Pleasants is a metahuman from Boston whose powers activated at the moment of his death, triggering a high-grade regeneration ability that restored him to a state of perpetual biological function while leaving his body in a constant cycle of decay and renewal. The result is an individual who is, by all practical definitions, a walking corpse that cannot die again. His heart beats approximately eight to twelve times per minute but does not circulate blood effectively; his blood has coagulated into a pudding-like sludge that oozes rather than flows. It remains unclear even to him how his brain continues to operate, as he has survived headshot wounds. The regeneration process produces an overwhelming stench of decomposition, which Pleasants contains by wearing a neon-yellow hazmat suit, sometimes augmented with a zombie mask and a black cloak overtop.

    As revealed in Interlude JP.2, Pleasants was diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) at age 22 by Dr. Kessler, a neurologist in Boston. CJD is a fatal prion disease with an average survival time of four to six months from diagnosis. After informing his parents and sister (who flew in from Portland), Pleasants traveled to Mammoth Lakes, California, a volcanic region in the Eastern Sierra where carbon dioxide vents naturally through the soil at lethal concentrations. He located a small cave with elevated CO2 levels and, on day twelve of his trip, entered it with the intention of dying by asphyxiation. He survived over thirty minutes in the lethal atmosphere, his body spontaneously adapting to not require oxygen - a classic near-death Activation Event. Upon emerging, he discovered rapid regeneration: cuts sealed in approximately fifteen seconds, leaving no scars. He returned to Boston, where Dr. Kessler's subsequent testing revealed that the CJD was initially still progressing - protein markers were higher than ever, indicating neural destruction "incompatible with" his continued coherent consciousness - but his brain was simultaneously rebuilding itself, with healthy tissue appearing in areas previously devastated by spongiform changes while the disease "chased" the regenerating tissue to new regions. By day eighteen of his hospitalization, the protein markers dropped dramatically and the CJD was effectively outpaced by his regeneration, with new neural tissue filling in the damaged areas. However, Dr. Kessler emphasized that the replaced tissue was entirely new - not healed original neurons, but rebuilt replacements. On day twenty-three, hospital chemical sensors detected ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and organic compounds emanating from his body, revealing the full scope of his condition: arrested decomposition. His digestive system functioned minimally, his circulatory system was practically inert, and his regeneration sustained him at the "minimum viable state" for consciousness and mobility while toxic byproducts accumulated and vented through his skin and breath. Specialists from the Department of Applied Anomalous Sciences (DAAS) and an organization called Aurora Springs assessed him, provided containment equipment (the hazmat suit), and discharged him with documentation of his registered metahuman status.

    Two months after his discharge, Pleasants began operating as a vigilante in Baltimore, where he intervened in an armed robbery at a convenience store. The gunman shot him center-mass, rupturing his hazmat suit and releasing his decomposition gases into the enclosed space, incapacitating the attacker. During this incident, he met a vigilante named Breakout - a woman in a cheap domino mask and street clothes with an athletic build and steel-wool hair - who finished subduing the gunman and invited Pleasants for coffee at a nearby diner. Breakout was the first person outside of medical professionals and family to voluntarily spend time in his presence after his condition became unmanageable.

    Pleasants was a friend and confidant of Diane Williams (Liberty Belle) during their college years. When Liberty Belle was killed by Chernobyl in December 2023, Pleasants traveled from Boston to Philadelphia for her funeral, where he delivered a eulogy, and attended the reading of her will, where he was named as a beneficiary. He remained in Philadelphia after Belle's death to continue her unfinished investigations, effectively inheriting her mission. He took a particular interest in looking after Sam Small, whom Belle had designated as her investigative successor.

    Shortly after his arrival in Philadelphia, Pleasants became an early ally to Sam. When NSRA agents attempted to confiscate Liberty Belle's materials from Sam, Crossroads of the Young Defenders foresaw the trouble and contacted Pleasants to intervene. He arrived at Lily Chen's house, repelling the agents with his stench and legal knowledge, and then brought Sam to his temporary base at an abandoned pier near the Betsy Ross Bridge. There, he helped Sam process the implications of Chernobyl's government protection and proposed assembling a team to investigate. Though he clashed with the teenage Auditors over his ends-justify-the-means approach to the NSRA investigation, it was Pleasants who suggested the team name "The Auditors" and who ultimately conducted the solo raid on the NSRA's Hatboro-Horsham facility on their behalf.

    In January 2024, the Kingdom of Keys framed Pleasants for the murder of four security guards at the NSRA office he had been investigating. Security footage appeared to show him inside the facility at the time of the killings. A citywide manhunt followed, with police, federal agencies, and vigilantes from other cities searching for him. The Auditors investigated and concluded the Kingdom was responsible for the frame-up, using their surveillance of the team's operations to orchestrate the false flag. Pleasants was eventually acquitted, but the incident left a permanent black mark on his record. Sam later advocated for clearing his name from her hospital bed after being injured by Chernobyl.

??? note "Powers & Abilities"

    **PERKS Assessment**

    No official PERKS assessment on file.

    **Abilities**

    - **High-Grade Regeneration** - Possesses an extreme regenerative ability that renders him practically unkillable without depowering. His regeneration activated at the moment of death in a CO2-filled cave near Mammoth Lakes, California, where his body spontaneously adapted to survive lethal asphyxiation. The regeneration operates at such a fundamental level that it rebuilt his brain from CJD-induced spongiform destruction, replacing devastated neural tissue with new, healthy neurons faster than the prion disease could destroy them. Surface wounds (cuts, scrapes) heal in approximately fifteen seconds, leaving no scars. His body exists in a perpetual state of decay and recycling: tissue rots and is continuously replaced, sustaining biological function at the minimum viable threshold. He has survived headshot wounds and shows no signs of degradation over time.
    - **Pain Immunity / Overexertion Tolerance** - Does not experience pain in any meaningful way, allowing him to exert himself well beyond normal human limits without consequence. Pleasants himself identified this trait during his hospitalization, noting that his muscles no longer undergo lactic acid buildup normally, enabling him to recruit them at full capacity whenever needed. This makes him appear stronger than he actually is, as he can push his body to extremes that would incapacitate or injure a normal person.
    - **Respiratory Independence** - Does not require oxygen to survive. His lungs function mechanically (allowing speech, breathing, and coughing) but do not perform gas exchange in the normal human sense. This ability first manifested when he survived over thirty minutes in a CO2-saturated cave that should have killed him within ten minutes.
    - **Toxic Gas Production** - His decomposing body continuously generates noxious gases, which he contains within his hazmat suit. He can release these gases tactically in combat situations to flood enclosed spaces and incapacitate opponents, as demonstrated during the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse confrontation.
    - **Firebomb Improvisation** - Can recycle and compress his own decomposition gases to create improvised incendiary devices.

    **Limitations**

    - Cannot build muscle mass; his regeneration reverts any gains from exercise, keeping his body in a fixed state of decay-renewal equilibrium. This means he cannot train to become physically stronger.
    - His overwhelming stench of decomposition makes stealth and social interaction extremely difficult. He requires a hazmat suit at all times to contain the odor.
    - His rotting condition prevents him from perceiving subtle flavors, requiring strong-tasting foods like kimchi and heavily spiced dishes.
    - While practically unkillable, depowering would presumably be fatal given his body's reliance on regeneration to sustain function.
    - His heart beats approximately eight to twelve times per minute, insufficient for effective circulation. His blood has coagulated into a pudding-like consistency and oozes rather than flows. His circulatory system is technically functional but practically inert.
    - His digestive system has minimal nutrient absorption. His regeneration compensates by pulling what it needs directly from the digestive tract, bypassing normal metabolic pathways entirely. He does not need to eat or excrete.
    - His liver and kidneys filter toxins, but the byproducts accumulate in his tissues and vent through his skin and breath: ammonia from protein breakdown, hydrogen sulfide from bacterial activity, methane in the digestive tract, and various volatile organic compounds from incomplete cellular processes. This is the source of his incapacitating stench.
    - DAAS specialists described his state as "arrested decomposition" - not rotting in the traditional sense, but failing to maintain homeostasis, with regeneration continuously resetting him to the minimum viable functional state.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Extensively self-educated across a wide range of disciplines, including criminal justice, international relations, metahuman law, Daedalus documentation, and geopolitics. Maintains an organized personal library at his safehouses covering subjects from the Federation of Saharan States to prison design philosophy.
    - Skilled interrogator, as demonstrated in his extraction of a confession from Elena Morales (Mrs. Doppelganger/Alice) at the Fishtown safehouse.
    - Trained in operational security: maintains multiple safehouses across cities (four in Philadelphia, six in Boston, two in New York), rotates locations, uses burner phones, and manages compartmentalized information.
    - Proficient in legal strategy, able to cite and apply legal frameworks in real time, as shown when he challenged the NSRA agents' authority during their attempt to seize Belle's materials.
    - Experienced in long-term covert operations, successfully maintaining his cover as a mole inside Argus Corps from its formation through the present.

??? warning "Personality"

    Pleasants is a self-described curmudgeon whose abrasive exterior predates his powers; as the character reference guide notes, his abilities simply made the outside match the inside. He approaches the world through a rationalist lens, favoring Bayesian probability and utilitarian calculus in his decision-making. He is strongly anti-government as a matter of principle, viewing institutional power with deep skepticism regardless of which institution wields it. Despite this philosophical framework, he is not cold or detached. He maintains a long-term engagement (seven years), a wide circle of friends, and genuine emotional investment in the people he chooses to protect.

    Interlude JP.2 revealed the depth of Pleasants' pragmatism in the face of his own mortality. When diagnosed with CJD at age 22, he responded with clinical detachment - asking his neurologist about the error bars on the diagnosis, processing the news through data rather than emotion, and spending the following two weeks on what he described as "administrative" preparation for death. He told his family he might not return from California, choosing a death on his own terms over the long decline into a vegetative state. When his Activation Event robbed him of that choice, his reaction was a bitter mixture of laughter and anguish - the absurdity of gaining immortality only to keep dying in a different way. He described his situation as having gotten "exactly what I wanted: survival," delivered with the dry resignation of someone who understands that the universe does not negotiate.

    His intellectual rigor is his defining trait. Unable to exercise or engage in much conventional social interaction due to his condition, Pleasants devotes enormous amounts of time to reading and studying. He knows a little bit of everything and can contextualize local events within global patterns of metahuman politics and institutional power. He is pragmatic to a fault, willing to propose plans with "collateral damage" that horrify his younger allies, but he is also capable of deferring to their ethical objections. He compared Sam to Liberty Belle, noting the same "particular kind of insanity" that drives people to care about systemic injustice. He described that drive as "the flu" that makes people become superheroes. His relationship with Sam echoes and contrasts his relationship with Belle: where Belle was his peer, Sam is someone he mentors and protects, though he respects her autonomy and strategic instincts.

??? warning "Relationships"

    | Character | Relationship | Notes |
    |-----------|-------------|-------|
    | Liberty Belle (Diane Williams) | Friend / Confidant (deceased) | College friends. Pleasants was a beneficiary of her will, delivered a eulogy at her funeral, and remained in Philadelphia to continue her investigations after her death. |
    | Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Mentee / Ally | Looks after Sam as the inheritor of Liberty Belle's legacy. Provided safehouses, supplies, strategic guidance, and operational funds during Sam's fugitive period. Their alliance is the core of the current campaign against Maya Richardson. |
    | Maya Richardson (Mrs. Zenith) | Target / Nominal superior | Pleasants knows Maya is Mrs. Zenith of the Kingdom of Keys. He joined Argus Corps specifically to operate as a mole against her. |
    | Patriot (Richard Johnson) | Teammate (nominal) | Argus Corps leader. Pleasants privately warned Patriot to be careful with Richardson, hinting she may not be who she appears. Maintains professional distance while operating his own agenda. |
    | Turbo Jett (Jasmine Perez) | Teammate (nominal) | Fellow Argus Corps member. Limited direct interaction documented. |
    | Captain Devil (Andrew Mitchell) | Teammate (nominal) | Fellow Argus Corps member. Partnered with Pleasants to evacuate "Maya" (actually Alice) during the Fishtown operation. |
    | Crossroads (Maxwell Martinez) | Ally | Young Defenders leader who alerted Pleasants about Sam's trouble with NSRA agents. Collaborated on intelligence operations during Sam's fugitive period. |
    | Councilman Jamal Davis | Associate | Davis publicly commented on Pleasants' situation during the NSRA frame-up and coordinated with Pleasants through Sam. Davis contacted Pleasants for "adult supervision" of the teenage Auditors. |
    | Fiancee (unnamed) | Partner | Engaged for seven years. Works at a funeral home. Pleasants maintains a cover story about surveillance work to explain his absences. |
    | Pleasants' Father | Family | Responded to Joshua's CJD diagnosis by going quiet and excusing himself to the garage. When Joshua called from California to say he was coming home, his father's voice cracked, revealing he had been bracing for a goodbye call every time the phone rang. Told Joshua "You're allowed to do it however you need to" regarding his end-of-life wishes. |
    | Pleasants' Mother | Family | Cried upon learning of the CJD diagnosis. Objected to Joshua's California trip, wanting him to stay near doctors and family, but deferred to her husband's support. Held Joshua's hand during his worst seizure; he failed to recognize her for almost a minute afterward. |
    | Pleasants' Sister | Family | Lives in Portland. Flew to Boston twice - once after the initial diagnosis and once during Joshua's hospitalization for the seizures, the second time acknowledged by all as a deathwatch. |
    | Dr. Kessler | Physician | Joshua's neurologist in Boston who diagnosed his CJD and subsequently monitored his Activation Event and recovery. Described as having "kind eyes and a terrible poker face." Applied for a grant from the Department of Applied Anomalous Sciences for more aggressive testing. Told Joshua his brain was "rebuilding itself faster than the disease can destroy it." |
    | Breakout (Diane Williams) | Early ally / Friend | Diane Williams operating under her original alias before adopting "Liberty Belle" in 2015. Pleasants encountered her in Baltimore two months after his discharge, when she subdued a gunman during his first vigilante intervention and invited him for coffee. She was the first person outside of medical staff and family to voluntarily spend time in his presence. Their Baltimore meeting predates her move to Philadelphia (2008) and her adoption of the Liberty Belle identity, establishing a friendship that lasted until her death. The college friendship referenced elsewhere in his biography likely deepened an existing connection from this earlier encounter. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Named as a beneficiary in Liberty Belle's will during the reading at Goldman, Reid & Miller (Ch. 46). Attended Belle's funeral in hazmat gear and delivered a eulogy (Ch. 47). Intervened when NSRA agents tried to confiscate Belle's materials from Sam at Lily Chen's house. Brought Sam to his temporary base at an abandoned pier near the Betsy Ross Bridge. Helped Sam interpret evidence of Chernobyl's government protection. Proposed assembling an investigative team. Met with the teenage Auditors at the Tacony Music Hall, where he clashed with them over the ethics of his proposed NSRA raid but ultimately suggested the team name "The Auditors." Conducted the solo infiltration of the NSRA's Hatboro-Horsham office. Subsequently framed by the Kingdom for the murder of four security guards at the facility, triggering a citywide manhunt. Agent Torres expressed doubts about Pleasants' guilt and provided footage to the Auditors suggesting a setup. The manhunt continued for weeks, with vigilantes from other cities joining the search.

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam follows Pleasants' legal case from her hospital bed during recovery, feeling guilty about his situation. She requests help from Multiplex to exonerate Pleasants using video evidence proving Kingdom framing (Ch. 65).

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Remains a fugitive during the period of Sam's return to active duty. The citywide manhunt continues, with vigilantes from other cities joining the search.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    Recruited by Maya Richardson into Argus Corps during a coworking space meeting (Interlude MR.4), where Maya appealed to his pragmatism and desire to fix the Jump epidemic - though Miasma joined as a covert mole to work against the Kingdom from within. Publicly presented as a founding member of Argus Corps alongside Patriot, Turbo Jett, and Captain Devil at Richardson's press conference announcing the team's "preemptive deterrence" strategy (Ch. 160). Named in the confidential Argus Corps formation proposal (Interlude MR.5). Appeared during the Stheno Pharmaceuticals warehouse confrontation (Ch. 163-164), releasing toxic gases into the smoke-filled space. Intentionally avoided confronting Sam during the chaotic three-way battle. The Auditors debate his surprising alliance with Argus Corps, questioning his motivations for cooperating with Richardson and Patriot.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced as part of Argus Corps' expanding operations during the post-Stheno period. Continues operating covertly within the team while maintaining his mole agenda against Maya Richardson and the Kingdom of Keys.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Privately warned Patriot to be careful with Richardson after a team briefing, suggesting she might not be who they think she is (Chapter 182). Continued operating within Argus Corps while maintaining his covert agenda.

    Revealed as a mole within Argus Corps and former ally of Liberty Belle. When Sam fled from Patriot and Turbo Jett's arrest attempt, Pleasants appeared in an alley and directed her to a safehouse while lying to Argus Corps over radio that he was in pursuit. Provided Sam with multiple safehouses, supplies, operational funds, strategic guidance, and his extensive library during her fugitive period. Helped Sam deduce the existence of a Kingdom shapeshifter ("Alice") responsible for framing both of them. Maintained his Argus Corps cover throughout, filing false reports and conducting misdirection. Monitored Sam's operational development, forcing her to take breaks when she showed signs of burnout. During the operation to capture Alice, evacuated "Maya" (actually Alice in disguise) to an unmarked car alongside Captain Devil. Interrogated Alice at a Fishtown safehouse (Interlude JP.1), breaking her by outlining legal consequences until she revealed herself as Elena Morales and provided a recorded confession. Texted Sam updates about the Inquirer article and Argus Corps deployment. Volunteered as Sam's guard during police custody. Called himself Sam's "psychopomp."

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** POV (Interlude JP.2)

    Full origin story. Diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease at age 22 by Dr. Kessler in Boston. Informed his parents and sister, then traveled to Mammoth Lakes, California, intending to die by CO2 asphyxiation in a volcanic cave. On day twelve, entered the cave and lost consciousness, but survived over thirty minutes in a lethal atmosphere - his Activation Event. Discovered rapid regeneration upon emerging (wounds healing in fifteen seconds). Returned to Boston, where testing revealed the CJD was initially still progressing but his brain was simultaneously regenerating, creating new tissue faster than the prions could destroy it. Hospitalized for seizures starting eleven days after his return; experienced memory loss, confusion, and temporary inability to recognize his mother. By day eighteen, protein markers dropped and the CJD was outpaced by regeneration. On day twenty-three, hospital chemical sensors detected toxic gases emanating from his body, leading to a full assessment by DAAS and Aurora Springs specialists who diagnosed "arrested decomposition." Discharged with a hazmat suit and registered metahuman documentation. Two months later, began vigilante operations in Baltimore, where he stopped an armed robbery (absorbing a gunshot center-mass without meaningful injury), met the vigilante Breakout, and adopted the codename Miasma.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Continues operating as a mole inside Argus Corps, nominally pursuing Sam while secretly working with her to take down Maya Richardson, whom he knows to be Mrs. Zenith of the Kingdom of Keys.


??? warning "Trivia"

    - Pleasants' rationalist philosophical orientation is described as Bayesian/probability-focused utilitarianism. The character reference guide notes that Eliezer Yudkowsky was never born in the story's timeline, so the real-world rationalist movement as such does not exist, though Pleasants arrived at similar conclusions independently.
    - His personal expenses are minimal: rent paid annually, approximately one hundred dollars per month on food, with his superhero pay covering everything else. He leaves cash for Sam in ziplock bags labeled "Operational funds. Don't get robbed."
    - The news broadcast covering his NSRA frame-up mentioned a controversial 2018 raid in Lowell, Massachusetts as a prior incident in his career.
    - He eats kimchi and other strongly flavored foods because his rotting condition prevents him from tasting anything subtle.
    - His fiancee works at a funeral home, a detail Sam found darkly fitting given his condition. They have been engaged for seven years.
    - The character reference guide describes his situation as "not a tragedy," noting he would be living the same way without powers; he is simply unkillable now.
    - He has an interlude chapter from his point of view (Interlude JP.1), in which he interrogates Alice/Elena Morales and delivers the line: "Getting to her was never the outcome. We're after Mrs. Zenith."
    - Sam once awkwardly misinterpreted a "corpse paint" comment from Pleasants as a sex joke, when he was actually referencing a makeup subculture.
    - Interlude JP.2 reveals Pleasants intended to become a chemistry teacher before his CJD diagnosis.
    - His Activation Event location - a CO2-venting volcanic cave near Mammoth Lakes, California - was deliberately chosen for its lethality. He selected it after researching the geology and confirming that CO2 concentrations in certain depressions were high enough to kill animals and hikers.
    - His resting heart rate is approximately eight to twelve beats per minute, compared to the normal human range of sixty to one hundred.
    - DAAS specialists noted that his sperm count remained viable, meaning IVF remained a theoretical possibility despite his otherwise non-functional biological systems.
    - When his hazmat suit was ruptured by a gunshot during the Baltimore robbery, the released gases were described as a complex bouquet: fermenting organic acids, coagulated blood oxidizing on contact with air, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and anaerobic bacterial byproducts.
    - Pleasants described Breakout's immediate acceptance of his condition with notable surprise; she did not step back or gag upon seeing the ruptured suit, instead filing the information away and continuing to operate. Her first critique of him was that he was "monologuing."
    - The interlude's opening and closing passages are framed by song lyrics.
