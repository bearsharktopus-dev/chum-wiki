## Background

Lily Chen is a superhuman who gained the ability to manipulate acceleration through touch. She was initially assessed by PERKS in 2021 at approximately age 15, receiving a provisional JLUMA (juvenile license) with required monthly check-ins. Her interviewing officer, Michael Reynolds, encouraged her to join the Young Defenders, where she could train alongside peers and develop her abilities in a structured environment.

As a member of the Young Defenders, Lily served primarily as a mobility asset, using her inline skates and acceleration powers to achieve speeds faster than most cars. When Sam Small's home in Mayfair was destroyed by Mr. Tyrannosaur, Lily and her family took Sam in, hosting her at their modest rowhome on Almond Street in Bridesburg for several months. Her parents, Mei and Jiang Chen, run the Golden Panda Buffet and are aware of their daughter's superhero activities.

Following the passage of Mayor Maya Richardson's anti-vigilante legislation in 2025, the Young Defenders faced dissolution. While some members chose to comply or transition to government-aligned teams, Lily refused to quit and joined the Auditors alongside Sam Small. She adopted the undercover alias "Powerwash" during the team's gambit against the Kingdom of Keys on the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge. As of early 2026, Lily continues to serve as the Auditors' primary transport and quick-response operative while attending college.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | A4/S/P/T |
| **Category** | Adjust |
| **Power Ranking** | 4/10 |
| **Control** | 6/10 |
| **Hostility** | 0/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 4/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 3/10 |

### Abilities

- **Acceleration Doubling** - Doubles the acceleration vector of any object she is in physical contact with along a single axis per activation. The effect lasts for one second and does not inherently revert, meaning acceleration continues naturally unless countered by external forces such as friction, drag, or counterthrust. Can apply this effect once per second per target.
- **High-Speed Mobility** - Primary application of her power is personal acceleration while skating on inline skates, allowing her to achieve speeds faster than most cars. Uses urban traversal techniques such as skitching onto vehicles and propelling herself off solid surfaces.
- **Enhanced Striking Power** - Applies acceleration boosts to objects mid-flight to significantly increase their impact force. Frequently employs this with her slingshot and meteor hammer for precision ranged attacks and non-lethal takedowns.
- **Kinetic Disruption** - Selectively boosts acceleration of objects to manipulate the balance of adversaries, knocking them off course or disrupting their movement.
- **Fast Fall / Gravity Spike** - Doubles the force of gravity downward on herself or a grappled opponent to spike them into the ground or rapidly descend.
- **Vehicle Acceleration** - Can boost the acceleration of vehicles she is in contact with.
- **Perceptual Object Unity** - Her power functions based on her cognitive perception of an object as a single entity, allowing her to apply acceleration to composite objects like inline skates or a meteor hammer as cohesive units.
- **Anomalous Biological Reinforcement** - Possesses an anomalous physical resilience that mitigates the effects of sudden acceleration shifts, allowing her to function under conditions that would incapacitate a normal human. This effect has limits and extreme acceleration stacking may exceed her tolerance threshold.

### Limitations

- **Touch Requirement** - Must maintain physical contact with an object to apply her ability, making it ineffective for long-range applications without projectiles.
- **Single Axis Per Activation** - Can only double acceleration along one axis (horizontal or vertical) per use.
- **Once Per Second Per Target** - Cannot stack multiple boosts on the same object within one second.
- **Diminishing Returns** - Air resistance and surface friction place practical limits on acceleration stacking, as objects at high velocities encounter increasing drag.
- **Cognitive Load** - Practical use requires precise timing, particularly when applying boosts to moving objects. Her own ability to perceive and respond to increased acceleration imposes limits on safe maximum velocity.
- **G-Force Tolerance** - Unlike natural speedsters, she does not receive automatic protection from all physical strain of high-speed movement. Extreme acceleration stacking may exceed her biological tolerance.
- **Limited Physics Understanding** - Does not fully grasp the mathematics of acceleration physics, which limits her ability to optimize her power's effectiveness.

### Training & Skills

- Trained with the Young Defenders in field operations, team coordination, and combat tactics.
- Proficient with slingshot, achieving sniper-like precision when combined with her acceleration power.
- Skilled with a meteor hammer, used both as a weapon and as a demonstration tool for de-escalation.
- Experienced in urban traversal and high-speed skating maneuvers.
- Currently learning boxing fundamentals from Sam Small, though more comfortable with weapons than empty-hand combat.
- Capable of independent intelligence gathering, leveraging her family's restaurant as a source of information from local police officers and community members.

## Personality

Lily is good-natured, optimistic, and energetic, bringing an unembellished enthusiasm to her team interactions. She is not the most intellectually sharp member of any group she belongs to, but this quality gives her a disarming earnestness that serves a valuable function. Her tendency to ask clarifying questions when she does not understand something can lead to eureka moments for her teammates or, occasionally, waste time. She has a knack for cutting through overthinking and getting straight to the point.

She possesses a strong personal moral code against lethal force and demonstrates restraint and situational awareness in combat. Her PERKS assessments consistently note her altruistic nature and zero hostility toward state actors or the public. Despite being characterized as reckless in her earlier years, particularly regarding high-speed maneuvering, she has matured into a competent and reliable operative capable of handling crises independently, as demonstrated when she managed a Songbird confrontation at the community center without violence.
