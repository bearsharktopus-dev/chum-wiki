## Background

Lily Chen is a superhuman who manipulates acceleration through touch. Assessed by PERKS in 2021 at approximately age 15, she received a provisional JLUMA with monthly check-ins. Her interviewing officer, Michael Reynolds, encouraged her to join the Young Defenders.

With the Young Defenders, Lily served primarily as a mobility asset, using inline skates and acceleration powers to achieve speeds faster than most cars. When Sam's home was destroyed by Mr. Tyrannosaur (Book 2), Lily's family took Sam in at their rowhome on Almond Street in Bridesburg for several months. Her parents, Mei and Jiang Chen, run the Golden Panda Buffet on Stiles Street - the only Huaiyang-style buffet in Northeast Philadelphia - and are aware of her superhero activities.

After Maya Richardson's anti-vigilante legislation dissolved the Young Defenders, Lily refused to quit and joined the Auditors. She continues to serve as the team's primary transport and quick-response operative while attending Temple University.

## Appearance

Approximately four inches shorter than Sam, with short hair dyed different colors over time - pinkish early on, then purple, then purple and white. Her costume is predominantly white with purple accents and a matte coating. She wears a rainbow scarf-cape that doubles as meteor hammers, with colored marbles woven into the fabric. By Arc 16, her field outfit includes a white cowl and domino mask. Her Powerwash disguise featured industrial yellows and whites, football padding, and a reinforced gas mask.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | A4/S/P/T |
| **Category** | Adjust |
| **Power Ranking** | 4/10 |
| **Control** | 6/10 |
| **Hostility** | 0/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 4/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 3/10 |

### Abilities

- **Acceleration Doubling** - Doubles the acceleration vector of any object she is in physical contact with along a single axis per activation. The effect lasts for one second and does not inherently revert, meaning acceleration continues naturally unless countered by external forces such as friction, drag, or counterthrust. Can apply this effect once per second per target.
- **High-Speed Mobility** - Primary application of her power is personal acceleration while skating on inline skates, allowing her to achieve speeds faster than most cars. Uses urban traversal techniques such as skitching onto vehicles and propelling herself off solid surfaces.
- **Enhanced Striking Power** - Applies acceleration boosts to objects mid-flight to significantly increase their impact force. Frequently employs this with her slingshot and meteor hammer for precision ranged attacks and non-lethal takedowns.
- **Kinetic Disruption** - Selectively boosts acceleration of objects to manipulate the balance of adversaries, knocking them off course or disrupting their movement.
- **Fast Fall / Gravity Spike** - Doubles the force of gravity downward on herself or a grappled opponent to spike them into the ground or rapidly descend.
- **Vehicle Acceleration** - Can boost the acceleration of vehicles she is in contact with.
- **Perceptual Object Unity** - Her power functions based on her cognitive perception of an object as a single entity, allowing her to apply acceleration to composite objects like inline skates or a meteor hammer as cohesive units.
- **Anomalous Biological Reinforcement** - Possesses an anomalous physical resilience that mitigates the effects of sudden acceleration shifts, allowing her to function under conditions that would incapacitate a normal human. This effect has limits and extreme acceleration stacking may exceed her tolerance threshold.

### Limitations

- **Touch Requirement** - Must maintain physical contact with an object to apply her ability, making it ineffective for long-range applications without projectiles.
- **Single Axis Per Activation** - Can only double acceleration along one axis (horizontal or vertical) per use.
- **Once Per Second Per Target** - Cannot stack multiple boosts on the same object within one second.
- **Diminishing Returns** - Air resistance and surface friction place practical limits on acceleration stacking, as objects at high velocities encounter increasing drag.
- **Cognitive Load** - Practical use requires precise timing, particularly when applying boosts to moving objects. Her own ability to perceive and respond to increased acceleration imposes limits on safe maximum velocity.
- **G-Force Tolerance** - Unlike natural speedsters, she does not receive automatic protection from all physical strain of high-speed movement. Extreme acceleration stacking may exceed her biological tolerance.
- **Limited Physics Understanding** - Does not fully grasp the mathematics of acceleration physics, which limits her ability to optimize her power's effectiveness.

### Training & Skills

- Trained with the Young Defenders in field operations, team coordination, and combat tactics.
- Proficient with slingshot, achieving sniper-like precision when combined with her acceleration power.
- Skilled with a meteor hammer (disguised as a scarf), used both as a weapon and as a demonstration tool for de-escalation.
- Experienced in urban traversal and high-speed skating maneuvers.
- Currently learning boxing fundamentals from Sam Small, though more comfortable with weapons than empty-hand combat.
- Capable of independent intelligence gathering, leveraging her family's restaurant as a source of information from local police officers and community members.
- Fluent in Mandarin.

## Personality

Lily is good-natured, optimistic, and energetic, with a disarming earnestness. Not the most intellectually sharp on any team she joins, but her tendency to ask clarifying questions often sparks eureka moments for teammates. She cuts through overthinking and gets straight to the point.

She holds a strong moral code against lethal force, with PERKS assessments consistently noting zero hostility. Though characterized as reckless in her earlier years, she has matured into a competent operative capable of handling crises independently. She is a horror movie fan, good at reading people, visibly uncomfortable in behavioral health facilities, and expresses affection physically - twisting her hands nervously, offering hugs freely.
