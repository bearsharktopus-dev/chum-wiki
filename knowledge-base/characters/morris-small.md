## Background

Morris "Pop-Pop Moe" Small is Sam Small's paternal grandfather, a retired civil engineer who co-founded Horvath-Small Ltd. with his business partner John Horvath. The firm specialized in weatherproofing and environmental engineering, and over the course of Morris's career, it completed infrastructure projects throughout the northeastern United States. Among its most significant contracts was the weather and disaster-proofing work on Daedalus Correctional Facility, the nation's first purpose-built superhuman prison, which became operational in 2006. Morris's involvement with Daedalus would later become a source of profound personal regret.

Morris was present during the boating accident that activated Sam's powers in the summer of 2023. He later revealed to Sam and her cousin Abigail that Sam's transformation was far more violent than Sam remembered or was told -- during the accident, Sam destroyed the boat's engine and became what Morris described as a "snarling beast of the sea, like an angry marlin." He apologized to Sam for the accident during their first on-page interaction and subsequently became one of the earliest figures to subtly encourage Sam's superhero activities, telling her at a Shabbat dinner shortly after her JLUMA was issued that the purpose of her abilities was simple: to save people's lives.

Morris is a widower. His wife Leah passed away prior to the events of the story, and he retired to a three-story brick rowhome in Ventnor, New Jersey, where he finds peace by the ocean. He took Sam to visit Leah's grave at Mount Zion Cemetery in New York, where Sam learned she was named after her great-great-grandmother Sofia and her great-grandfather Elijah. Morris's mother-in-law (Leah's mother) was a Holocaust survivor, an experience that profoundly shaped Morris's worldview and his philosophy about self-reliance and the responsible use of power. He later taught his son Benjamin to shoot at age 21, imparting the lesson that sometimes there would be no superhero around and sometimes there would just be you.

Prior to the events of the story, Morris met with Liberty Belle on multiple occasions regarding Daedalus Correctional Facility. Belle visited Morris at his home in 2014 to discuss how the facility had evolved from containment to deliberate isolation, showing him photographs of isolation cells and their psychological effects on inmates. Morris admitted to having filed anonymous concerns about ventilation and long-term effects during construction but acknowledged he had not taken stronger action. These meetings connected Morris to the broader conspiracy surrounding Daedalus and the mysterious figure known as Porcelain, whom Morris had encountered at the construction site under the alias "Espinosa."

### Training & Skills

- **Civil Engineering** — Co-founded and operated Horvath-Small Ltd., a firm recognized for weatherproofing and environmental engineering. Completed major infrastructure projects across the northeastern United States, including work on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and Daedalus Correctional Facility.
- **Firearms Proficiency** — Taught his son Benjamin to shoot. Preferred teaching in the woods with watermelons rather than at formal ranges. His philosophy on firearms and power was pragmatic: power of any kind is neither good nor bad, and what matters is when, why, and how it is used.
- **Storytelling and Moral Instruction** — Possesses a deep knowledge of Jewish parables, religious teachings, family history, and comic book narratives, which he draws upon to guide Sam and other family members through moral and ethical dilemmas.
- **Institutional Knowledge of Daedalus** — Retains detailed engineering knowledge of Daedalus Correctional Facility's construction, including its design specifications, contractor relationships, and the modifications that transformed it from a containment facility into an instrument of isolation.

## Personality

Morris is philosophical, warm, and quietly authoritative. He speaks with a mix of gentle humor and earned wisdom, frequently drawing upon Jewish parables, family history, and stories from comic books and science fiction to frame the moral lessons he imparts. He explained kosher dietary laws to Sam as a metaphor for the balance between knowledge and action -- ruminant animals chew cud (reflection) and have split hooves (action), and a person needs both. During Rosh Hashanah, he served as the Maggid, recounting the Exodus narrative, and later offered philosophical commentary on free will and the consequences of choices. When Sam faced the growing threat of Pattinson's Pals and social upheaval, Morris gave her a copy of "Green Lantern/Green Arrow: Hard Traveling Heroes," a comic about superheroes confronting social injustice.

Beneath his storytelling warmth, Morris carries significant moral weight. He regrets his involvement with Daedalus and considers it a stain on his legacy, acknowledging that he did not ask enough questions when concerning modifications were made to the facility's design. He filed anonymous complaints but recognizes he could have done more. This regret does not paralyze him; instead, it informs the counsel he gives Sam, encouraging her to keep questioning difficult ethical issues rather than accepting complicity through silence. He is a source of tension with his son Benjamin, as the two disagree about Sam's superhero activities -- Morris subtly encourages them while Benjamin prioritizes her safety -- a philosophical divide that has produced at least one overheard argument at the hospital during Sam's recovery from Chernobyl.

| Book 13: Burn After Reading | Major Supporting | Sam discovers Liberty Belle's notebooks containing a section labeled "Daedalus Contractors" that mentions Horvath-Small Ltd. Sam finds Belle's notes documenting meetings with Morris about Daedalus, revealing he had "ethical concerns" about "certain design specifications." When Morris arrives for dinner, Sam confronts him and brings him to her room to discuss Daedalus privately. In the extended Interlude MS.1, Morris experiences vivid flashbacks to the 2006-2007 construction of Daedalus, recalling concerning blueprint modifications, encounters with the British contractor Jared Cross, and the Israeli consultant "Espinosa" (later identified as possibly being Porcelain). He recalls his 2014 meetings with Liberty Belle, where she showed him photographs of isolation cells. Morris admits to filing anonymous concerns but regretting not taking stronger action. He reveals that during construction, the government covered all cost overruns without question, a detail that heightened his suspicions about the facility's true purpose. He also tells Sam that Belle eventually shifted her investigative focus from Daedalus to Illya (Chernobyl), and that in their final meeting, Belle showed him a photo of someone called "Porcelain" whom Pop-pop recognized as possibly being "Espinosa" from the Daedalus construction; Belle seemed particularly troubled by whatever she discovered about Porcelain. Morris acknowledges the moral complexity of building necessary containment that became inhumane and encourages Sam to keep questioning.

Morris's grandmother (Leah's mother), a Holocaust survivor, is cited as the origin of the family's inherited self-reliance patterns. Ben takes Sam to a gun range and recalls Morris's teaching methods and his philosophy about power: "Power -- any kind -- isn't good or bad. It's about when and why and how you use it" (Ch. 214). John Horvath (Morris's business partner) designed the renovation blueprints for the Tacony Music Hall's conversion into a community center, directly connecting Morris's professional legacy to Sam's present-day work (Ch. 211). Referenced during dinner scenes with the family. |

## Trivia

- Morris claims to have met Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, as well as Mr. Chakravarti (Mr. Genesis), whom he described as a true hero.
- His cat Schlemiel is named with characteristic Jewish humor -- a schlemiel is a habitually unlucky or bungling person in Yiddish.
- Morris taught Sam about kosher animals as a metaphor for moral balance: animals must both chew cud (reflect on knowledge) and have split hooves (take action). Sam would later cite this teaching in her moral reasoning.
- He enjoys classic Jewish foods, reads Arthur Conan Doyle, and loves comic books and science fiction. His home contains a bookshelf stuffed with yellowed comics and dog-eared pulp novels.
- He wears a cord with a pendant of personal significance, though the specific meaning of the pendant has not been revealed.
- The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which Morris referenced in his parenting metaphor, was completed in 1964, placing him in the workforce during the mid-twentieth century and consistent with his age.
- Sam concluded early in the story that she could never be a villain because she could not bear disappointing her Pop-Pop.
- Morris's business partner John Horvath later designed the renovation blueprints for the Tacony Community Center, directly linking Morris's professional network to Sam's community work.
- His great-grandfather Elijah's experiences with the House Un-American Activities Committee establish a generational pattern of the Small family being targeted by government overreach, paralleling Sam's conflicts with the NSRA and anti-vigilante legislation.
- During the Daedalus construction, Morris encountered a British contractor named Jared Cross who requested additional isolation features for "emergent conditions" (powers) and demonstrated his own tar-based powers during containment testing. An Israeli consultant named "Espinosa" observed the testing and praised Pop-pop's work; "Espinosa" was later identified as possibly being Porcelain, the leader of Red Calf and one of the story's most dangerous figures.
- The government covered all cost overruns on Daedalus without question, a red flag Morris noted but did not act on strongly enough beyond anonymous complaints about ventilation and long-term isolation effects.
