## Background

Morris "Pop-Pop Moe" Small is Sam Small's paternal grandfather, a retired civil engineer who co-founded Horvath-Small Ltd. with his business partner John Horvath. The firm specialized in weatherproofing and environmental engineering, completing major infrastructure projects across the northeastern United States - including the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the weather-proofing of Daedalus Correctional Facility, the nation's first purpose-built superhuman prison (operational 2006). His involvement with Daedalus became a source of profound personal regret.

Morris was present during the boating accident that activated Sam's powers in 2023 and became one of the earliest figures to subtly encourage her superhero activities. A widower, he retired to a three-story brick rowhome in Ventnor, New Jersey, after his wife Leah's passing. His mother was a Holocaust survivor, an experience that profoundly shaped Morris's worldview and his philosophy about self-reliance and the responsible use of power.

Prior to the story's events, Liberty Belle contacted Morris multiple times about Daedalus, connecting him to the broader conspiracy surrounding the facility and the mysterious figure known as Porcelain, whom Morris had encountered at the construction site under the alias "Espinosa."

### Training & Skills

- **Civil Engineering** - Co-founded Horvath-Small Ltd.; retains detailed knowledge of Daedalus's design specifications, contractor relationships, and the modifications that transformed it from containment into isolation.
- **Firearms Proficiency** - Taught Benjamin to shoot in the woods with watermelons rather than at formal ranges. Pragmatic philosophy on power: it is neither good nor bad, and what matters is when, why, and how it is used.
- **Storytelling and Moral Instruction** - Draws on Jewish parables, family history, and comic book narratives to guide Sam and other family members through ethical dilemmas.

## Personality

Morris is philosophical, warm, and quietly authoritative - a natural storyteller who blends gentle humor with earned wisdom. He frames moral lessons through Jewish parables, family history, and comic book narratives (Arc 1, 5, 7), making complex ethical questions accessible.

Beneath the warmth, Morris carries significant moral weight. His regret over Daedalus - where he filed anonymous complaints but recognizes he could have done more - directly informs his counsel to Sam: keep questioning rather than accepting complicity through silence. He and his son Benjamin disagree about Sam's superhero activities, with Morris defending her calling while Benjamin prioritizes her safety.

He recalls his 2014 meetings with Liberty Belle, where she showed him photographs of isolation cells. Morris admits to filing anonymous concerns but regretting not taking stronger action. He reveals that during construction, the government covered all cost overruns without question, a detail that heightened his suspicions about the facility's true purpose.
