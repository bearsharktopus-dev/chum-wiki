## Background

Dr. Felix Ortega is a 37-year-old biochemist and pharmacist who was dismissed from professional service after repeatedly prescribing patients medications that had not been authorized by their doctors. Ortega operated on the assumption that he knew better than the treating physicians, and while he was usually correct in his assessments, he was not always right. This pattern of behavior ultimately cost him his license and his career in legitimate medicine.

Following his dismissal, Ortega's disillusionment with the medical establishment and regulatory frameworks drove him toward increasingly radical views about human biology and the nature of superpowers. At some point, he joined Lawrence Sullivan's criminal organization Rogue Wave, where his metahuman ability to extract superpowers in crystalline form and his genius-level understanding of biochemistry made him indispensable. He became the architect of Rogue Wave's core products: Jump, a green capsule powder granting temporary powers for approximately three hours, and Fly, an injectable colored liquid conferring semi-permanent abilities. Both substances are derived from crystals that Ortega extracts from powered individuals using his metahuman ability, which he then grinds and chemically adulterates into distributable drug forms.

Ortega views his work with Jump and Fly as merely the beginning of a much larger project. He regards powered individuals as the next stage of human evolution and considers his research an acceleration of natural selection. This philosophical framework, combined with his total disregard for ethical constraints, positions him as one of the most intellectually dangerous members of Rogue Wave's leadership, even if he rarely engages in direct combat.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Superpower Extraction** - Ortega can extract superpowers from other metahumans in the form of crystals that grow from slits in his gloves on the backs of his hands. The process requires physical contact with the target (typically placing his hand on their neck or skin) and takes approximately 90 seconds to complete. During extraction, there is a golden glow, and the crystalline structure emerges - initially clear and geometric before developing color and luminescence. The resulting crystal physically manifests the extracted power, leaving the target permanently depowered. The procedure is extremely painful for both Ortega and the subject; Ortega sweats, clenches his jaw, and staggers afterward, wrapping his hand in gauze. He has described doing this "multiple times a day for many days."
- **Crystal Ingestion Transfer** - The raw crystals produced by extraction can be ingested whole to grant the consumer the extracted power. This method is unpleasant, as the crystals are solid mineral formations that must be swallowed.
- **Crystal Processing (Jump/Fly Production)** - The crystals can be ground up and chemically adulterated through Ortega's pharmaceutical expertise to produce Jump (temporary power capsules) and Fly (semi-permanent power injectables). A single extraction from Jackpot's probability assessment power yielded a larger-than-average crystal - approximately apple-sized with a branching, fractal, dendritic structure, golden-amber and semi-translucent - capable of producing 60 standard doses, each lasting approximately 3 hours and 14 minutes. Snake Oil can identify 3-4 distinct "precipitates" per crystal (e.g., pure probability perception, statistical weighting, outlier detection, and decision-tree mapping). Processing takes days due to backlog.
- **Anomalous Crystal Properties** - Aurora Reyes (Pyrausta) revealed during her interview that the crystals Ortega produces have additional, previously unknown properties beyond ingestion and drug production. When burned, the crystals produce unusual effects on fire, the full implications of which remain unexplored.

### Limitations

- Extraction requires sustained physical contact (~90 seconds), making the process vulnerable to interruption.
- Purely extractive; he does not gain the abilities he removes.
- No known combat abilities; relies entirely on Rogue Wave operatives for protection.
- His arms bear old scars - thin white lines from wrist to elbow - from years of repeated extractions.
- Power falls under the Filch category (extracting properties from a system), not Brain - his scientific genius is entirely natural.

### Training & Skills

- Doctoral-level education in biochemistry and pharmacology; genius-level expertise in pharmaceutical compounding and drug formulation.
- Capable of field medical treatment (e.g., treating Rush Order's gunshot wound, Arc 12).
- Knowledgeable about viral vector research; proposed collaborating with Dr. Necrosis on a retroviral vector carrying Jump enhancement, rejected by Sullivan due to ideological incompatibility.

## Personality

Ortega embodies the mad scientist archetype. He is obsessive, amoral, and singularly focused on his research, dismissing ethical concerns as intellectual weakness. Physically short and stout with thick-framed glasses, he looks like "someone's disappointed chemistry teacher." He wears latex gloves with cut-off fingertips, speaks in a clinical dry tone, and is perpetually annoyed.

He hates everyone equally and does not play favorites, though he shows a capacity for dry concern (e.g., hoping Rush Order would not get shot again). His management style is notoriously demanding. Despite his misanthropy, he recognizes competence - he was genuinely impressed by Aurora Reyes's self-taught chemistry despite her lack of formal education.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business) | Leader / Colleague | Sullivan relies on Ortega's extraction ability as the foundation of Rogue Wave's drug operation. |
| Elias Franklin (Chimera) | Assistant | Recruited as his scientific assistant (Arc 12); assists with procedures at safehouses. |
| Dean Carver (Rush Order) | Colleague | Provided medical treatment for Rush Order's injuries (Arc 12). Expressed dry concern about him being shot again. |
| Jackpot (Tomas Reynoso) | Colleague / Source | Regularly extracts Jackpot's randomized powers for conversion into Jump. Painful for both but Jackpot participates willingly. |
| Birthday Suit | Colleague | Fellow core member of Rogue Wave. |
| Dead Drop (Renee Costello) | Colleague | Fellow core member of Rogue Wave. |
| Mr. Polygraph (Lucas Donovan) | Extraction Target | Extracted his lie detection power at the Camden safehouse (Arc 15), leaving him permanently depowered. |
| Aurora Reyes (Pyrausta) | Interviewee | Impressed by her self-taught chemistry and discovery of anomalous crystal properties. Candidacy outcome unresolved. |
| Dr. Necrosis | Potential Collaborator (Discussed) | Ortega proposed retroviral vector delivery for Jump; Sullivan rejected it because Necrosis opposes all market-based medicine. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Rogue Wave is revealed as the organization behind the Jump and Fly drug distribution during Sparkplug's interrogation, though Snake Oil is not named individually. The Fly drug is introduced and its effects are documented when Chimera (Elias Franklin) attacks the IBC building.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Jump and Fly continue spreading across Philadelphia, with four Jump-related incidents occurring in eighteen hours. The Philly Phreaks weaponize tainted Jump at the courthouse during the Chernobyl trial, causing mass mutagenic transformations.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Snake Oil is not directly referenced. Rogue Wave's operations are discussed in the context of the mind-control trigger phrase discovered during an encounter with a street dealer (Ch. 128) and in Kingdom leadership discussions about Rogue Wave's threat to their market (Interlude MR.2).

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Rogue Wave's operations are referenced in relation to the worsening Jump epidemic. The Kingdom monitors Rogue Wave's activities while dealing with its own internal crises.

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam and the Auditors infiltrate a Rogue Wave distribution event at a Pennsport marina (Chapter 156), gaining intelligence on the organization's operations. Snake Oil then appears as one of six Rogue Wave members featured in the NBC10 emergency broadcast (Chapter 158), identified as "Dr. Snake Oil" and handling drug production. He is shown wearing a rubber snake mask and labcoat. The broadcast, which hijacks the emergency alert system via a VHS tape delivered by a contracted suicide bomber, declares war on the Kingdom of Keys and reveals Rogue Wave's extensive network of contracted operatives.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Featured in Interlude LS.1, set at Rogue Wave headquarters. Snake Oil extracts Jackpot's probability assessment power during a strategic planning meeting, producing a larger-than-average crystal (see Abilities for specs). The team discusses contract revisions following Jordan Westwood's exposure of a vulnerability and plans expansion into Kingdom territory through 7 new distribution hubs.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Rogue Wave hijacks NBC10 with a job posting recruiting a "mad scientist's assistant" for Snake Oil (Ch. 183), with a scavenger hunt using Milton Friedman books as identifiers. In Interlude RS-DC-JF, Snake Oil treats Rush Order's bullet wound (partial deltoid, 9mm fragment extraction) at a Camden safehouse while Elias cleans Rush Order's facial lacerations. In Interlude LS.2, Snake Oil and Sullivan conduct a full day of assistant interviews at a Toyota dealership, evaluating multiple candidates. Snake Oil is impressed by Aurora Reyes's self-taught chemistry and her discovery that his crystals produce anomalous effects when burned. He proposes the Dr. Necrosis retroviral collaboration, which Sullivan rejects. Elias Franklin (Chimera) is ultimately recruited.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in the context of Rogue Wave's ongoing operations during the escalating conflict with the Kingdom and anti-vigilante forces.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam contacts Rogue Wave through Derek and Elias to negotiate protection for her family against Shrike, cashing in Rush Order's public declaration that Ben Small is under Rogue Wave protection. Following the resolution of the Shrike crisis, Sam owes Rogue Wave a favor - help with Mr. Polygraph - which sets up the events of Arc 15.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Featured in Interlude DC.2, where Rogue Wave executes an operation to capture Kingdom lieutenant Mr. Polygraph from Roxborough Memorial Hospital. The operation is enabled by Sam's tip to Rush Order about the Kingdom's evidence disposal at the hospital back lot. Rogue Wave uses a geased PI as bait during a multi-day stakeout, and when the Kingdom sends Mr. Polygraph to investigate, the combat team (Birthday Suit, Rush Order, Dead Drop) captures him. Snake Oil performs the power extraction at the Camden safehouse, placing his hand on Mr. Polygraph's neck while Elias preps novocaine as partial mitigation. Over 90 seconds, Mr. Polygraph's lie detection power materializes as a blue-green luminescent, fist-sized crystal growing from Snake Oil's hand. The extraction leaves Mr. Polygraph permanently depowered. Sullivan wants the crystal processed as Fly immediately. Snake Oil is dismissive of Sam being their intelligence source, remarking, "The teenage vigilante. Wonderful."

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Rogue Wave's operations continue in the background as Kingdom intercepts Rogue Wave shipments and taints Jump with stimulants before releasing it back to the streets. Argus Corps hits Rogue Wave distribution points for PR purposes. Snake Oil is not directly featured.
