## Background

Dr. Felix Ortega is a 37-year-old biochemist and pharmacist who was dismissed from professional service after repeatedly prescribing patients medications that had not been authorized by their doctors. Ortega operated on the assumption that he knew better than the treating physicians, and while he was usually correct in his assessments, he was not always right. This pattern of behavior ultimately cost him his license and his career in legitimate medicine.

Following his dismissal, Ortega's disillusionment with the medical establishment and regulatory frameworks drove him toward increasingly radical views about human biology and the nature of superpowers. At some point, he joined Lawrence Sullivan's criminal organization Rogue Wave, where his metahuman ability to extract superpowers in crystalline form and his genius-level understanding of biochemistry made him indispensable. He became the architect of Rogue Wave's core products: Jump, a green capsule powder granting temporary powers for approximately three hours, and Fly, an injectable colored liquid conferring semi-permanent abilities. Both substances are derived from crystals that Ortega extracts from powered individuals using his metahuman ability, which he then grinds and chemically adulterates into distributable drug forms.

Ortega views his work with Jump and Fly as merely the beginning of a much larger project. He regards powered individuals as the next stage of human evolution and considers his research an acceleration of natural selection. This philosophical framework, combined with his total disregard for ethical constraints, positions him as one of the most intellectually dangerous members of Rogue Wave's leadership, even if he rarely engages in direct combat.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Superpower Extraction** — Ortega can extract superpowers from other metahumans in the form of crystals that grow painfully from the backs of his hands. The process requires physical contact with the target (typically placing his hand on their neck) and takes approximately 90 seconds to complete. The resulting crystal physically manifests the extracted power, leaving the target permanently depowered. The procedure is extremely painful for both Ortega and the subject.
- **Crystal Ingestion Transfer** — The raw crystals produced by extraction can be ingested whole to grant the consumer the extracted power. This method is unpleasant, as the crystals are solid mineral formations that must be swallowed.
- **Crystal Processing (Jump/Fly Production)** — The crystals can be ground up and chemically adulterated through Ortega's pharmaceutical expertise to produce Jump (temporary power capsules) and Fly (semi-permanent power injectables). A single extraction from Jackpot's probability assessment power yielded a larger-than-average crystal capable of producing 60 standard doses.
- **Anomalous Crystal Properties** — Aurora Reyes (Pyrausta) revealed during her interview that the crystals Ortega produces have additional, previously unknown properties beyond ingestion and drug production. When burned, the crystals produce unusual effects on fire, the full implications of which remain unexplored.

### Limitations

- The extraction process is extremely painful for Ortega, with crystals growing out of the backs of his hands each time he uses his ability.
- Extraction requires sustained physical contact with the target, making the process vulnerable to interruption.
- Ortega's power is purely extractive; he does not gain the abilities he removes from others.
- He has no known combat abilities and relies entirely on Rogue Wave's other operatives for protection during operations.
- His powers fall under the Filch category (extracting properties from a system), not the Brain category — his scientific genius is entirely natural, not power-derived.

### Training & Skills

- Holds a doctoral-level education in biochemistry and pharmacology.
- Possesses genius-level expertise in pharmaceutical compounding, drug formulation, and biochemical research, all achieved through natural intellect rather than Brain-type metahuman enhancement.
- Capable of providing field medical treatment, as demonstrated when tending to Rush Order's gunshot wound and facial lacerations at a Camden safehouse.
- Knowledgeable about viral vector research and advanced drug delivery mechanisms, having discussed potential collaboration with Dr. Necrosis on creating viral vectors for Jump enhancement.
- Skilled at evaluating scientific talent, as shown during the LS.2 interlude where he assessed seventeen candidates for the role of his laboratory assistant.

## Personality

Ortega embodies the mad scientist archetype in its purest form. He is obsessive, amoral, and singularly focused on advancing his research, dismissing ethical concerns as intellectual weakness. He speaks in a distinctive blend of clinical terminology and grandiose pronouncements about human evolution, reflecting a worldview in which scientific progress justifies any methodology. He is autistic, and his blunt, unsentimental communication style reflects both his neurodivergence and his fundamental disinterest in social convention.

Ortega hates everyone equally and is grumpy virtually all of the time. He does not play favorites among his Rogue Wave colleagues, though he demonstrates a capacity for dry concern, as when he expressed hope that Rush Order would not get shot again. His management style is demanding enough that at least one qualified candidate (Jennifer Torres) was rejected during the assistant recruitment process specifically because she would struggle to work under him. Despite his misanthropy, Ortega recognizes competence when he encounters it — he was genuinely impressed by Aurora Reyes's self-taught chemical knowledge and her discovery of previously unknown properties of his crystals, even though she lacked formal education.

## Arc Appearances

| Book | Role | Key Events |
|------|------|------------|
| Book 5: Mayfly | Mentioned | Rogue Wave is revealed as the organization behind the Jump and Fly drug distribution during Sparkplug's interrogation, though Snake Oil is not named individually. The Fly drug is introduced and its effects are documented when Chimera (Elias Franklin) attacks the IBC building. |
| Book 6: Sideshow | Mentioned | The Kingdom of Keys identifies Rogue Wave as an emerging threat involving apparent mind control. Maya Richardson encounters mind-controlled individuals triggered by the phrase "Rogue Wave." Jump and Fly continue spreading across Philadelphia. |
| Book 8: Big | Mentioned | Rogue Wave is discussed as a growing threat alongside the Kingdom. The organization's drug distribution network continues to expand across the Northeast. |
| Book 9: Sheol | Mentioned | Rogue Wave's operations are referenced in relation to the worsening Jump epidemic. The Kingdom monitors Rogue Wave's activities while dealing with its own internal crises. |
| Book 10: Plume | Supporting | Snake Oil appears as one of six Rogue Wave members featured in the NBC10 emergency broadcast (Chapter 158), identified as handling "drug production." The broadcast, which hijacks the emergency alert system, declares war on the Kingdom of Keys and reveals Rogue Wave's extensive network of contracted operatives. Sam and the Auditors infiltrate a Rogue Wave distribution event at a Pennsport marina (Chapter 156), gaining intelligence on the organization's operations. Jordan identifies Jackpot as essential to Jump production, indirectly referencing Snake Oil's extraction process. |
| Book 11: Alarm Will Sound | Supporting | Featured in Interlude LS.1, set at Rogue Wave headquarters. Snake Oil performs the extraction of Jackpot's probability assessment power during a strategic planning meeting, producing a larger-than-average crystal capable of yielding 60 standard doses. The painful crystallization process is described in detail. Sullivan contemplates the philosophical and market implications of the new variant. The team discusses contract revisions following Jordan Westwood's exposure of a vulnerability and plans expansion into Kingdom territory. |
| Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only | Supporting | Snake Oil tends to Rush Order's injuries at a Camden safehouse following Rush Order's confrontation with Sam on South Street (Chapter 190 interlude). He and Elias provide medical treatment while the team discusses the philosophical implications of the publicity stunt. Snake Oil expresses hope that Rush Order will avoid being shot again. Rogue Wave continues drug distribution while navigating the three-way conflict with the Kingdom and Argus Corps. In Interlude LS.2, Snake Oil and Monkey Business conduct a full day of interviews at a Toyota dealership to recruit a scientific assistant. They evaluate seventeen candidates, with Snake Oil impressed by Aurora Reyes's self-taught chemistry and her discovery that his crystals produce anomalous effects when burned. He also suggests potential collaboration with Dr. Necrosis on viral vector Jump delivery, which Sullivan rejects. The final candidate, Elias Franklin (Chimera), is ultimately recruited. Snake Oil is mentioned as the creator of Jump and Fly and as the scientist seeking an assistant (Chapter 183). |
| Book 13: Burn After Reading | Mentioned | Referenced in the context of Rogue Wave's ongoing operations during the escalating conflict with the Kingdom and anti-vigilante forces. |
| Book 14: Shelter in Place | Supporting | Featured in Interlude DC.2, where Rogue Wave executes an operation to capture Kingdom lieutenant Mr. Polygraph from Roxborough Memorial Hospital. Snake Oil performs the power extraction at a secondary location in Camden, placing his hand on Mr. Polygraph's neck after administering local anesthetic. Over 90 seconds, Mr. Polygraph's lie detection power materializes as a blue-green crystal growing from Snake Oil's hand. The extraction leaves Mr. Polygraph permanently depowered. The crystal is designated for processing into Fly. This operation was enabled by Sam's tip to Rogue Wave about the Kingdom's evidence disposal location. |
| Book 15: Severe Weather Warning | Mentioned | The consequences of Snake Oil's extraction of Mr. Polygraph's power continue to reverberate. Monkey Business has acquired Mr. Polygraph's lie-telling ability through ingestion of the crystal. The Kingdom's interest in power extraction technology is noted as an unexplored thread. Vysera (daxerimab), a power suppressant drug that enters NSRA experimental trials, is suspected by Elias Franklin to be derived from Snake Oil's research — and it is. |
| Book 16: Category Five Hurricane | Supporting | Snake Oil is among the Rogue Wave leadership working to hold the organization together while Mr. Antithesis rampages offscreen. Elias continues investigating Vysera's connection to Snake Oil's extraction research. |

## Trivia

- Snake Oil's alias is a reference to the historical term "snake oil salesman," denoting a fraudulent peddler of miracle cures — an ironic name given that his products genuinely grant superpowers, albeit through criminal means.
- He was introduced to readers visually during the NBC10 broadcast in Chapter 158, where he appeared alongside the five other core Rogue Wave members as the team declared war on the Kingdom of Keys.
- The extraction process produces crystals of varying sizes depending on the power being extracted. Jackpot's probability assessment power produced a "larger-than-average" crystal.
- His research has had unintended downstream consequences: the NSRA's experimental drug Vysera (daxerimab), a power suppressant used in Derek Taylor's werewolf trials, is derived from Snake Oil's extraction research without his knowledge or consent.
- Despite being called "Dr. Snake Oil" during the NBC10 broadcast, it is unclear whether Ortega holds a formal doctorate or whether the title is self-applied based on his expertise.
- He is one of the few Rogue Wave members whose real name has been established in the character reference materials, though it has not been revealed in-story.
- Jennifer Torres was rejected as an assistant candidate specifically because evaluators determined she could not handle Snake Oil's management style, suggesting he is a notoriously difficult person to work under.
- Snake Oil's power falls under the Filch classification in the PERKS system (extracting properties and removing them from a system), making him one of the rarer power types in the setting, where Filch abilities account for approximately 12% of all powers.
