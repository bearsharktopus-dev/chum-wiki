## Background

Elijah Brooks was a professional cruiserweight boxer and boxing coach who ran Knockout Gym on Kensington Avenue in Philadelphia. A truck accident triggered his metahuman powers, and the sudden ability to create independent duplicates rendered competitive boxing impossible, ending his fighting career. Despite this, professional fighters still had him in their coaching lineages, and people came to Philadelphia specifically to train with him. He stands approximately 6'2" with a heavyweight build, moving with a grace that seems impossible for his size.

Professor Franklin recruited Elijah to the Delaware Valley Defenders in 2016 as lead combat instructor and full-time government employee. He served as second-in-command under Liberty Belle, though his emphasis on systems and discipline frequently put him at philosophical odds with her charisma-driven, freeform approach. A traumatic early mission in which three of his clones were killed - one tortured to death - cemented this philosophy.

Following the deaths of Professor Franklin and Liberty Belle, Elijah became the DVD's effective operational leader. Beginning in summer 2025, he also served as Sam Small's personal combat trainer (Ch. 166-onward), a mentorship that proved instrumental in Sam's development as a fighter.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Self-Duplication** - Can create up to twelve independent clones of himself. New duplicates phase directly out of his body, appearing as a green glob that peels off and forms into a full copy. Each clone operates autonomously with its own decision-making capability and lasts up to twenty-four hours before expiring. When dismissed or expired, clones dissolve into a greenish sludge that evaporates near-instantly.
- **Memory Absorption** - Each clone runs on a separate consciousness track, not a real-time shared awareness. Upon a clone's expiration or voluntary recall, its accumulated memories merge back with Elijah. This effectively allows him to be in multiple places at once and gather intelligence from numerous sources simultaneously.
- **Consciousness Transfer ("Seat" Transfer)** - If Elijah's primary body dies, his consciousness instantly transfers to his oldest active clone with full continuity of experience. He refers to his active consciousness as his "seat." This ability renders him extremely difficult to kill permanently as long as at least one clone exists.

### Limitations

- **Clone Cap** - Limited to a maximum of twelve simultaneous clones.
- **Clone Duration** - Each clone expires after twenty-four hours if not recalled.
- **Clone Vulnerability** - Clones can be injured, tortured, and killed. The trauma and memories from these experiences transfer back to Elijah, causing psychological harm.
- **No Power Stacking** - His clones do not appear to possess any enhanced physical abilities beyond those of a well-trained human; they share his baseline physical capabilities.

### Training & Skills

- Expert-level hand-to-hand combatant and boxing coach. Vastly outmatches Sam Small in sparring, demonstrating superior technique, reach control, and ring craft.
- Described as one of the smartest non-supergenius humans alive.
- Highly skilled tactical thinker who emphasizes disciplined, methodical approaches to crisis situations.
- Teaching philosophy centers on building a base of fundamentals that work without powers - boxing, BJJ, judo, Muay Thai - then integrating powers on top as force multipliers. Mantra: "powers fail, skills don't."
- Believes mercy should be a selection filter rather than a training outcome: select for people who already value mercy, then train lethal competence with chosen restraint.

## Personality

Elijah is strict, demanding, and outwardly emotionless in professional settings. He speaks in a deep, resonant baritone with clipped, efficient sentences, valuing discipline and structure above all else. He carries the weight of leadership with visible stress, and his by-the-book approach frequently puts him at odds with more impulsive colleagues. Despite his controlled exterior, he has a volatile temper that can flare when provoked, though he actively works to keep it in check.

Boxing brings out a different side - his sense of humor emerges and he becomes noticeably less tense when teaching. He is capable of surprising vulnerability and genuine concern for those he mentors. He harbors deep respect for Liberty Belle despite their philosophical disagreements, and told Sam she reminds him of Belle - a comparison he appeared to find both amusing and meaningful.

    Has a pivotal heart-to-heart with Sam at DVD headquarters (Ch. 166), sharing his backstory as a former cruiserweight boxer whose powers were triggered by a truck accident, and the trauma of losing three clones (one tortured to death). Offers Sam sparring and boxing training once she heals. Begins intensive training sessions starting the first weekend of June (Ch. 169-170), identifying her three fundamental problems: poor dodging (flinching instead of slipping), overreliance on regeneration tankiness, and insufficient creative power integration. Introduces a "hit points" and "HP budget" framework for understanding power costs, and asks probing questions about tooth shapes, blood sense modality, and shark adaptations. This leads Sam to develop the jaw-clenching absorption technique and the Instant Armor ability. Adapts his training approach as Sam develops - once she masters the jaw clench for head shots, he switches to targeting her body exclusively. His training mantra "powers fail, skills don't" becomes a foundational principle. Present at DVD headquarters in Chapter 177 when Sam delivers the Stheno data flash drive and Hypeman sample; furious about Sam's recklessness, telling her she is not Belle and is taking all the wrong lessons from her. Puts Sam on physical rehab with Nurse Sylvia and suspends her sparring privileges, warning her she will be watched closely.

    Part of the DVD team assisting in the search operation for Shrike, the escaped Daedalus inmate targeting Bloodhound.

Featured in Interlude JB.1, a flashback to 2016 where Professor Franklin hires him as the DVD's lead combat instructor after Elijah dismantles him in a 90-second spar. The interlude reveals his background at Knockout Gym and his philosophy that mercy should be a selection filter, not a training outcome.


## Trivia

- The canon document for Book 2 mistakenly labels Multiplex as a "Young Defender" in one instance, though he is consistently an adult member of the Delaware Valley Defenders throughout the story.
- Sam's development under both Belle's inspirational approach and Elijah's systems-based approach represents a thematic synthesis of the two philosophies.
- His costume is crimson-and-black, and he fights with boxing gloves. His duplicates have been seen carrying riot shields during crisis operations.
- Sam's regeneration prevents her from getting drunk or high, a fact Elijah relays to colleagues, noting Crossroads told him about it.
- HIRC forum users debate whether Multiplex is A-tier or B-tier.
- He was recommended to Professor Franklin by a contact named Marcus from Westside Gym.
