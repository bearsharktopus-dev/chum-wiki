## Background

Joseph Jones, known as Pumice, is a metahuman whose entire body has been permanently converted into mobile, motile stone - a hulking figure at six foot six, 630 pounds, covered in dark grey rock with white cuboid teeth and craggy features. The circumstances of his activation are undocumented.

Pumice was a member of the Philly Phreaks, a gang of visually apparent metahumans in Philadelphia. He fought the Young Defenders on South Street (Arc 3), participated in Sam Small's kidnapping alongside Aaron McKinley (Arc 4), and later joined the Phreaks' courthouse terrorist attack during the Fedorov trial (Arc 6). He was ultimately subdued by the combined efforts of Playback, Spindle, and Gale, and incarcerated at the Daedalus Correctional Facility.

### Abilities

- **Stone Physiology** - Pumice's entire body, both internal and external, has been converted into a highly abrasive and porous stone material. His stone composition has a Mohs hardness rating of 6.5, comparable to quartz, granting exceptional durability and resistance to physical damage. Most melee weapons and many conventional firearms are incapable of doing meaningful damage.
- **Abrasive Surface** - His body has a measured surface roughness of approximately 24-grit on the CAMI scale, making his skin extremely coarse. Physical contact with his body can rapidly abrade and damage organic and inorganic materials alike, grating off several layers of skin on contact and causing numerous small cuts capable of rapid blood loss.
- **Enhanced Strength** - Possesses proportional enhanced strength that allows him to move and operate at speeds comparable to a normal human despite weighing approximately 630 pounds. Capable of hurling people, lifting and dragging vehicles, and overpowering most opponents in hand-to-hand combat.
- **Stone Regeneration** - Limited ability to heal damage to his stone body by absorbing inorganic materials such as concrete or grout. These materials are slowly converted into new stone tissue when applied to chips, cracks, or other damage.

### Limitations

- **Porous Vulnerability** - His porous stone composition makes him susceptible to corrosive agents and chemical attacks. Strong acids or bases could potentially penetrate his stone matrix and cause widespread internal damage.
- **Slow Regeneration** - His regenerative process is extremely slow, even slower than normal human healing. Minor chips or cracks require hours or days to heal, while severe damage may take weeks or months.
- **Repair Material Dependency** - Regeneration relies on the availability of suitable inorganic materials. Without access to concrete, grout, or similar substances, his healing process halts.
- **Weight and Mobility** - At approximately 630 pounds, he can have difficulty navigating narrow spaces, fragile structures, or unstable terrain.
- **Biological Requirements** - Despite his stone composition, Pumice still requires food, water, and sleep. He avoids acidic food and drink. It is currently unknown whether he still possesses internal organs, a skeleton, or a brain.

### Training & Skills

- No formal combat training is documented. Relies on raw physical power and durability in fights.
- Shows awareness of how to use his abrasive surface offensively in close-quarters combat, including smothering bear hugs designed to scrape opponents.

## Personality

Pumice views his criminal actions as a necessary response to societal marginalization, expressing little remorse while simultaneously showing a desire to see a "body count." Blunt and direct, he dismisses unnecessary drama. Despite his willingness to engage in violence, he has clear limits - he vocally objected to Aaron McKinley's torture of Sam and refused to participate (Arc 4).

An avid Philadelphia sports fan (Phillies, Sixers), he frequently wears Allen Iverson and Sixers jerseys and engages in casual sports talk even with adversaries mid-fight, remarking that "Sports are the great equalizer." Also makes wrestling references (Stone Cold stunners, People's Elbow). His Daedalus containment procedures note that sports updates and paraphernalia serve as effective behavioral incentives.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Patches (Amira Irshad) | Leader | Respected Patches as the Phreaks' leader. Her arrest motivated his continued criminal activity. |
| Chrysalis (Angela Perez) | Teammate | Protective of her; punched Aaron when he threatened her with fire. |
| Deathgirl (Daisy Zhen) | Teammate | Protective of her. Gently chides her when she goes off-topic during group discussions. |
| Connor (Spindle) | Former teammate | Betrayed the group by blinding Pumice with adhesive spray during the South Street battle. |
| Aaron McKinley | Temporary ally | Allied against Bloodhound after Patches' arrest. Phreaks severed ties after Aaron's torture of Sam went too far. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Enemy | Primary adversary across multiple fights. Calls her "little fishy," "Smalls," and "Jaws." |
| Elias Franklin (Chimera) | Associate | Escaped LOVE Park on Chimera's back in quadruped form. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Introduced during the Young Defenders' briefing on the Philly Phreaks, wearing an Allen Iverson jersey. Sam attempts to build rapport with him over their shared appreciation for Iverson. During the South Street confrontation, he fights Rampart and nearly chokes him unconscious, throws parking meters at Sam like shuriken, and drags a broken car across asphalt to create a dust cloud for cover. Spindle blinds him by spraying stolen adhesive into his eyes, and he flees alongside Chrysalis while Blink crashes into him from above.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Participates alongside Aaron McKinley and the remaining Phreaks in an ambush and kidnapping of Sam. During her captivity, expresses open discomfort with Aaron's torture methods, telling him "this is messed up" and declining to participate in the fingernail removal. Puts out Daisy's hair when Aaron accidentally sets her on fire, and argues about Sixers basketball with Aaron between bouts of violence. Gets his stone body chipped by Sam's tooth-knuckles during her escape - the first time he experiences real pain from an attack. After the botched kidnapping, the Phreaks confront Aaron at the docks to dress him down. Pumice punches Aaron across the wet dock, and the Phreaks sever ties with him, leaving him alone on the waterfront.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Reappears at LOVE Park during the Jump crisis, revealing that Deathgirl now leads the Phreaks. Grabs Sam by the neck and throws her, then seizes Rampart in a bear hug and suplexes him. Engages Sam in an extended fight where her tooth-knuckles and shin-teeth manage to crack his stone body, causing him genuine pain. Taunts Sam mid-fight about her height and references the nails Aaron removed. Escapes on Chimera's back in quadruped form. Later participates in the Phreaks' terrorist attack at the courthouse during the Fedorov trial, trudging through the crowd impervious to rubber bullets and tear gas with Deathgirl perched on his back. Sent after Playback by Deathgirl, but subdued through the combined efforts of Playback, Spindle, and Gale, and arrested.

## Trivia

- His PERKS assessment was conducted by Officer Michael Thompson in August 2024, with a detailed power analysis by Dr. Emily Nakamura in September 2024.
- His containment procedures at Daedalus were prepared by Dr. Ethan Novak and approved by Warden Elizabeth Hold, with NSRA liaison Agent Marcus Lee.
- His containment unit uses ultra-high-performance concrete or steel-fiber-reinforced concrete, with vibration sensors to detect attempts to wear down the walls.
- High-pressure quick-hardening foam dispensers are installed in his cell as an immobilization measure.
- A carefully controlled supply of inorganic repair materials is provided in his containment unit to facilitate his regeneration.
- When his stone body is cracked, water has been observed spraying from the wounds, suggesting his stone physiology retains some form of internal moisture.
- Spindle refers to him casually as "Joe" in conversation with other heroes.
- His surface areas vary in roughness, with his palms, the soles of his feet, and facial stone being smoother than the rest of his body.
- His Daedalus inmate number is 84928166.
