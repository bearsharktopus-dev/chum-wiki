## Background

Joseph Jones, known as Pumice, is a metahuman who underwent a complete transformation into a humanoid entity composed entirely of mobile, motile stone. The circumstances surrounding his activation event are not documented in available records. His stone physiology is permanent and constantly active, leaving him as a hulking figure covered in dark grey rock with a surface roughness equivalent to 24-grit sandpaper. He weighs approximately 630 pounds.

Pumice was a member of the Philly Phreaks, a gang of visually apparent metahumans operating in Philadelphia. He participated in the Phreaks' confrontation with the Young Defenders on South Street, where he fought Rampart and other heroes before fleeing alongside Chrysalis when fellow member Spindle betrayed the group. Following the arrest of the Phreaks' leader Patches, Pumice was recruited by Aaron McKinley into an alliance against Sam Small. He participated in the kidnapping and torture of Sam during winter of 2023, though he expressed visible discomfort with Aaron's sadistic methods. Sam damaged his stone face during her escape, and the Phreaks subsequently severed ties with Aaron, with Pumice punching him when Aaron attempted to threaten Chrysalis.

Pumice later reappeared at LOVE Park during the crisis involving the mutagenic drug Jump, attacking Sam and Rampart before escaping on the back of Elias (Chimera). His involvement in the Phreaks' terrorist attack at the Philadelphia courthouse during the Fedorov trial ultimately led to his arrest. He was subdued through the combined efforts of Playback, Spindle, and Gale, and was subsequently incarcerated at the Daedalus Correctional Facility.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | G6/S/P/T (primary), E5/S/P/T (secondary), A1/S/P/T (tertiary) |
| **Category** | Gigant (primary), Employ (secondary), Adjust (tertiary) |
| **Power Ranking** | 6/10 (Gigant), 5/10 (Employ), 1/10 (Adjust) |
| **Control** | 9/10 |
| **Hostility** | 7/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 6/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 6/10 |

### Abilities

- **Stone Physiology** - Pumice's entire body, both internal and external, has been converted into a highly abrasive and porous stone material. His stone composition has a Mohs hardness rating of 6.5, comparable to quartz, granting exceptional durability and resistance to physical damage. Most melee weapons and many conventional firearms are incapable of doing meaningful damage.
- **Abrasive Surface** - His body has a measured surface roughness of approximately 24-grit on the CAMI scale, making his skin extremely coarse. Physical contact with his body can rapidly abrade and damage organic and inorganic materials alike, grating off several layers of skin on contact and causing numerous small cuts capable of rapid blood loss.
- **Enhanced Strength** - Possesses proportional enhanced strength that allows him to move and operate at speeds comparable to a normal human despite weighing approximately 630 pounds. Capable of hurling people, lifting and dragging vehicles, and overpowering most opponents in hand-to-hand combat.
- **Stone Regeneration** - Limited ability to heal damage to his stone body by absorbing inorganic materials such as concrete or grout. These materials are slowly converted into new stone tissue when applied to chips, cracks, or other damage.

### Limitations

- **Porous Vulnerability** - His porous stone composition makes him susceptible to corrosive agents and chemical attacks. Strong acids or bases could potentially penetrate his stone matrix and cause widespread internal damage.
- **Slow Regeneration** - His regenerative process is extremely slow, even slower than normal human healing. Minor chips or cracks require hours or days to heal, while severe damage may take weeks or months.
- **Repair Material Dependency** - Regeneration relies on the availability of suitable inorganic materials. Without access to concrete, grout, or similar substances, his healing process halts.
- **Weight and Mobility** - At approximately 630 pounds, he can have difficulty navigating narrow spaces, fragile structures, or unstable terrain.
- **Biological Requirements** - Despite his stone composition, Pumice still requires food, water, and sleep. He avoids acidic food and drink. It is currently unknown whether he still possesses internal organs, a skeleton, or a brain.

### Training & Skills

- No formal combat training is documented. Relies on raw physical power and durability in fights.
- Shows awareness of how to use his abrasive surface offensively in close-quarters combat, including smothering bear hugs designed to scrape opponents.

## Personality

Pumice views his criminal actions as a necessary response to societal marginalization and injustice, expressing little remorse for his involvement in terrorist activities while simultaneously showing a noted desire to see a "body count." He is blunt and direct in conversation, preferring to get straight to the point and dismissing what he considers unnecessary drama. Despite his willingness to engage in violence, he demonstrated visible discomfort during Aaron McKinley's torture of Sam Small, suggesting limits to his tolerance for cruelty even if he did not intervene.

Outside of criminal activity, Pumice has a strong interest in Philadelphia sports, particularly the Phillies and Sixers. He was frequently seen wearing Allen Iverson and Sixers jerseys, and was willing to engage in casual sports conversation even with adversaries. His containment procedures at Daedalus note that updates on Philadelphia professional sports teams and approved sports paraphernalia serve as effective behavioral incentives.

## Relationships
