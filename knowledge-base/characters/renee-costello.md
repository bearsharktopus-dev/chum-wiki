## Background

Renee "Ren" Costello is a former journalism student who dropped out after falling deep into conspiracy theories. Government agents interrogated her about suspicious search history - she believes it was because of her research into extraterrestrial phenomena, but in reality she had searched "Ted Kaczynski" followed by "How to make fertilizer bomb," triggering domestic terrorism monitoring. The interrogation cemented the paranoid worldview that would define her adult life.

Following this radicalization, Renee joined Rogue Wave, the criminal organization distributing the power-granting drugs Jump and Fly throughout Philadelphia. Despite being the youngest core member at twenty-three, she became one of its most ideologically committed operatives. She serves a dual role as intelligence specialist and primary capture specialist, using ferrokinetic abilities to restrain targets in the field.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Ferrokinesis (Fly Power)** - Telekinetic manipulation of metal, specializing in chains and restraints. Can shape metal into binding configurations, suspend targets in midair, and constrict with enough force to bruise skin and restrict breathing. Chains respond in real time, allowing adjustment of tension, repositioning, and use of restrained targets as human shields.
- **Power Radar** - Passive, omnidirectional sensory ability that detects nearby powered individuals and identifies their specific powers. Does not provide directional information or identify which person in a group possesses the detected power.

### Limitations

- The power radar does not convey direction or identify which individual possesses the detected abilities, limiting its tactical precision in crowded environments.
- Her ferrokinesis appears to require existing metal in the environment to manipulate; she is not observed creating metal from nothing.
- She is a baseline human in terms of physical durability and does not possess enhanced strength, speed, or regeneration.
- When struck in the hand by a slingshot projectile (by Blink during the Sunoco station confrontation), she lost control of her chains, suggesting that pain or physical disruption can interfere with her metal manipulation.

### Training & Skills

- Trained in intelligence gathering, surveillance, and target identification.
- Skilled in interrogation and searching captives for recording devices.
- Incomplete journalism background likely informs her research methodology.

## Personality

Renee is intensely paranoid, with an unwavering conspiratorial worldview that sees government control and institutional surveillance as the ultimate evils. She speaks in coded language and perceives patterns that others miss - or that may not exist at all. Her paranoia has been reinforced by genuine encounters with government overreach in the world of powered individuals, making her beliefs self-sustaining regardless of their original foundation.

She presents a gothic aesthetic and "surly" demeanor. In the field, she is ruthless and decisive, willing to debate killing an opponent based on practical calculus rather than moral hesitation. Possibly the most ideologically devoted of Rogue Wave's core team, her rigid worldview leaves little room for nuance: the system is the enemy, and Rogue Wave's methods represent the only honest response.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First appeared during Rogue Wave's NBC10 broadcast in Chapter 158, identified as one of six core members alongside Monkey Business, Birthday Suit, Rush Order, Snake Oil, and Jackpot. Listed as the group's "tracker/hunter" during the televised manifesto that declared war on the Kingdom of Keys and revealed Rogue Wave's network of contracted individuals.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Provides intelligence on the Kingdom's reduced operations at the Rogue Wave strategic planning meeting (Interlude LS.1), informing controlled expansion planning.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Main

    First in-person field appearance. During the Auditors' surveillance of Rogue Wave's Tacony drug operation, Sam bumped into a "surly looking girl in goth clothes" on a city bus near the Sunoco station (Chapter 180) - later revealed to be Dead Drop. In Chapter 181, Dead Drop captured Bloodhound at the Sunoco station using ferrokinetic chains after Sam's infiltration was compromised, suspending her upside down and debating with Marathon whether to kill her. Searched Sam for recording devices. In Chapter 182, used Sam as a human shield while the Auditors mounted a rescue. Blink struck Dead Drop's hand with a slingshot, disrupting her chain control. Rush Order arrived on motorcycle to extract Dead Drop, and she chose escape over killing Sam. Tasha later identified Dead Drop and Rush Order from the May NBC10 broadcast, confirming them as core Rogue Wave members. In Interlude RS-DC-JF, Dead Drop and Jackpot returned to the Camden safehouse with Chinese food following Rush Order's fight with Bloodhound on South Street, during which Rush Order was shot by Benjamin Small. Dead Drop was described with chains clinking and an annoyed goth demeanor.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Part of Rogue Wave's operations during the Shrike protection arrangement with Sam, including providing surveillance photos and identifying Mr. Polygraph as the favor to be called in.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Selected by Monkey Business as part of the combat team (alongside Rush Order and Birthday Suit) for the Mr. Polygraph extraction operation at Roxborough Memorial Hospital (Interlude DC.2). Dead Drop used her ferrokinetic chains offensively during the ambush - wrapping Polygraph's torso, arms, and legs like a mummy and gagging him with a dishrag. She also caught guns mid-draw from Kingdom operatives using her chains and told the restrained Polygraph that he "should've thought about that before your organization decided to fuck with kids." After Snake Oil removed Mr. Polygraph's powers at a secondary location in Camden, Dead Drop was shown playing Mario Kart with "grim determination" at the Camden safehouse, with the winner controlling the stereo - she played Tool. Referenced as part of Rogue Wave's broader operations during the escalating conflict, as Kingdom forces intercepted and modified Rogue Wave's Jump shipments, creating a tainted drug crisis.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up (Interlude DC.3)"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Partnered with Rush Order on a joint reconnaissance-turned-ambush of Maya Richardson during a winter blizzard in Northeast Philadelphia. Dead Drop drove the van while Dean navigated using his person-location sense, the pair operating with established tactical coordination described as having been "run a dozen times on Kingdom couriers and drug shipments." Dead Drop's power radar sensed something wrong about Maya before the confrontation - Maya felt like a "brick wall" in her brain rather than the "diffuse static electricity" typical of weather powers, an early indication that Maya's true ability was not weather control. After locating Maya on a six-story industrial rooftop conducting weather manipulation, Dead Drop's ferrokinetic chains snagged Maya's ankle and wrist during the initial capture attempt, but Maya broke free by snapping out of her clothes to escape the restraints. In the enclosed stairwell confrontation, Dead Drop launched gyroscopically stabilized chain-link projectiles at Maya, but Maya's barokinetic pressure field stopped them mid-flight. When Maya sealed the fire door and created a crushing pressure zone, Dead Drop broke the pressure seal by tearing the fire door off its hinges with brute ferrokinesis, creating an opening that relieved the pressure. Maya escaped by dropping down the stairwell center using controlled pressure descent. Dean's passive aerokinesis partially shielded Dead Drop from Maya's pressure manipulation during the stairwell fight - without it, she would have been crushed. Dead Drop supported the injured Dean down six flights of stairs afterward and contributed to the tactical debrief at the Camden safehouse. She noted that Maya could use pressure differentials for three-dimensional mobility via controlled falls, adding a critical observation to the intelligence gathered. Monkey Business subsequently reclassified Maya as a hazard to route around rather than pursue directly.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Kingdom forces continue intercepting and sabotaging Rogue Wave's Jump distribution; Dead Drop is not featured directly.


## Trivia

- The term "dead drop" in espionage refers to a secret location for passing information without direct contact - fitting for an intelligence specialist.
- One of Sam's civilian informants, a friend of Darius named "Costello," shares her surname (encountered at Campbell Square Park), though no explicit connection is confirmed.
- Youngest member of Rogue Wave's core team by several years, with the next youngest being Chimera at twenty-six.
