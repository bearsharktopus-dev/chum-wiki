## Background

Lawrence Sullivan is the founder and leader of Rogue Wave, a decentralized criminal organization distributing the power-granting drugs Jump and Fly throughout Philadelphia. Before turning to crime, Sullivan worked as an associate at Whitmore & Associates, a contract law firm on the fourteenth floor of the Meridian Financial building at 1847 Chestnut Street in Philadelphia. He specialized in contract law, distinguished primarily by his ability to find loopholes that more senior partners missed and his complete lack of interest in firm politics.

As revealed in Interlude LS.3, Sullivan's Activation Event occurred during an armed hostage situation at his workplace. Four armed men - two with revolvers, two with collapsible batons - took approximately thirty hostages in the fourteenth-floor conference room. The operation appeared to be organized and professional rather than ideological. The leader made a verbal declaration to the hostages: "We won't hurt any of you, as long as everyone in this room cooperates." Sullivan experienced a nosebleed and then felt the statement crystallize into a supernaturally binding contract. He instinctively parsed the language as he would any legal document, identifying critical asymmetries: "everyone in this room" imposed a spatial limitation on the cooperation clause (applying only to those currently present in the room), while "we won't hurt any of you" contained no spatial restriction (their non-violence obligation was absolute). Sullivan tested his theory by requesting a restroom break with an escort. Upon stepping through the conference room doorway, he felt the cooperation clause dissolve. He called 911 from his personal cell phone (the gunmen had only collected work phones), then confronted his escort, Martinez. When Martinez attempted to swing his baton at Sullivan, the contract physically prevented the motion - his arm locked up, unable to execute the strike. Sullivan incapacitated Martinez with a necktie, photographed the gunmen from the hallway, and waited for the tactical team, which arrived eleven minutes later. All hostages were freed without casualties, and the gunmen were arrested in a state of confused compliance, unable to explain why their weapons had stopped working.

In the three weeks following the incident, Sullivan methodically experimented with his power, testing small agreements with baristas, colleagues, and casual acquaintances. He established the fundamental rules: both parties must understand the terms for a contract to bind; the contract binds both parties equally; and language matters - exact words and precise phrasing determine scope, not intent or common understanding. He recognized that his power executed contracts "as written" rather than as intended, meaning the advantage belonged to whoever controlled the language. Six months later, Sullivan resigned from Whitmore & Associates with a polite resignation letter and two-week notice period. He purchased a monkey mask from a closing costume shop on impulse, and upon putting it on, felt the same shift he had experienced in the conference room - a moment of demarcation, transforming from Lawrence Sullivan, Esq. into something new.

Sullivan built Rogue Wave around an anarcho-capitalist ideology that views the state monopoly on metahuman power as an unmitigated tragedy. Under his leadership, the organization developed Jump (a drug granting temporary superpowers) and Fly (a more dangerous compound granting permanent abilities), created by his chief scientist Dr. Felix Ortega (Snake Oil). Rogue Wave positions itself as a revolutionary enterprise rather than a traditional criminal syndicate, framing its drug distribution as the democratization of power. Sullivan wears a monkey mask during operations and public appearances, maintaining the theatrical persona of "Monkey Business."

Rogue Wave first came to the attention of Philadelphia's hero community when the organization was named during Sparkplug's interrogation in early 2024. Sullivan's organization subsequently expanded aggressively, signing approximately one thousand contracted individuals in Philadelphia by spring 2025, and ultimately declaring open war on the Kingdom of Keys through a hijacked television broadcast on NBC10.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Supernatural Contract Creation** - Sullivan can create binding contracts that supernaturally compel all parties to comply with specific terms. These contracts can enforce a wide range of behaviors, including attacking those who question Rogue Wave, following direct orders from designated Rogue Wave representatives, and maintaining operational secrecy. The contracts function as a form of absolute enforcement: a party attempting to violate the terms experiences physical inability to execute the forbidden action (e.g., a gunman's arm locking up mid-swing when attempting to strike Sullivan in violation of a non-violence clause). As demonstrated during LS.3, the power can activate on purely verbal agreements - the hostage-taker's spoken declaration was sufficient to create a binding contract without any written document. Sullivan's Activation Event was itself triggered by a verbal agreement during a hostage crisis, suggesting the power emerged from the intersection of mortal threat and his professional expertise in contract language.
- **Contract Requirements** - The contracts must be understood by the signer or speaking party to take effect. There are no hidden fees or concealed clauses; if a party does not comprehend what they are agreeing to, the contract does not bind. This represents a significant limitation on the power's coercive potential. However, Sullivan discovered that the power exploits the gap between what people think they are agreeing to and what the precise words actually specify - not through deception (the understanding requirement prevents that), but through precision of language. Contracts execute "as written" - exact words, precise phrasing, and specific parameters determine scope, not intent or common understanding.
- **Acquired Power: Lie-Telling** - Sullivan has recently acquired Mr. Polygraph's lie-telling power after having Snake Oil extract it from the Kingdom operative and presumably ingesting or otherwise absorbing the resulting crystal. The full extent and application of this secondary power have not yet been depicted.

### Limitations

- **Comprehension Requirement** - Contracts only bind those who understand the terms, preventing Sullivan from tricking illiterate or non-comprehending targets into compliance. Agreements made under obvious duress still bind, but agreements made with people who genuinely do not comprehend the terms do not take hold.
- **Mutual Binding** - The contract binds both parties equally. Whatever obligations Sullivan creates for others, he also creates for himself. During the LS.3 hostage situation, while the gunmen could not hurt him due to their non-violence clause, Sullivan could not take offensive action against them while the cooperation clause still applied to him inside the room. This symmetry means Sullivan cannot create purely one-sided agreements.
- **Exploitable Clause Language** - Jordan Westwood demonstrated that contract clauses can be exploited by deliberately triggering enforcement conditions. After Jordan exposed a vulnerability by provoking a contracted school security guard into a violent attack, Sullivan was forced to redraft his contract language to close such loopholes.
- **No Direct Combat Power** - Sullivan's primary ability is administrative and contractual rather than combative; he relies on his enforcers, particularly Birthday Suit, for personal protection in dangerous situations.

### Training & Skills

- Former associate at Whitmore & Associates specializing in contract law, with extensive knowledge of legal language, negotiation tactics, and exploitable ambiguities in contractual terms. His pre-powers career was specifically focused on finding loopholes in agreements, a skill that directly translates into his supernatural contract power.
- Highly skilled strategic planner capable of orchestrating complex multi-stage operations involving numerous operatives, diversionary tactics, and contingency planning.
- Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of organizational management, running Rogue Wave as a decentralized network with specialized roles and clear chains of command.
- Philosophically literate, drawing on anarcho-capitalist and libertarian economic theory to frame and justify Rogue Wave's operations.

## Personality

Interlude LS.3 revealed Sullivan's pre-Rogue Wave demeanor: calm, analytical, and unflinchingly rational under extreme pressure. During the hostage crisis that triggered his Activation Event, he remained the only person in the room who did not panic, instead parsing the gunman's verbal agreement with the same professional detachment he would apply to a client's licensing agreement. He described himself as someone who had "lost more at the slots" than the fear he felt in that moment. His worldview crystallized during and after the event: the legal system was "built on a beautiful lie" that contracts mean something, when in reality contracts meant nothing without enforcement and the powerful broke agreements whenever convenient. His power allowed him to fix that - not by working within the system or destroying it, but by building something where "contracts actually mean something."

Sullivan is theatrical and philosophical, combining the efficiency of a seasoned businessman with the showmanship of a carnival barker. He speaks in metaphors about meritocracy, evolution, and natural progression, framing Rogue Wave's drug distribution as an ideological mission rather than criminal enterprise. He views the current state of affairs, where metahuman abilities are subject to government surveillance and bureaucratic control, as a disaster, and positions Rogue Wave as the corrective force. He treats setbacks as evolutionary pressure that forces system improvement rather than as defeats. LS.1 reveals a more contemplative side: Sullivan spends significant time considering the philosophical implications of contract language and consciousness, and is genuinely fascinated by the metaphysical question of whether conscious observation can disrupt statistical probability (prompted by Jackpot's probability assessment power). His interview process in LS.2 shows methodical patience -- he evaluates candidates across a full day with clear rubrics rather than relying on gut instinct, though he remains capable of making sharp judgments quickly when a candidate reveals a disqualifying trait.

Sullivan respects competence and conviction regardless of which side it comes from. He is noted to respect Sam Small for her persistence and commitment to her principles. He demonstrates pragmatic judgment in his dealings, such as rejecting a potential collaboration with Dr. Necrosis on ideological grounds despite the tactical advantages it might offer. He is seeing Birthday Suit romantically on the side, a fact known to all of Rogue Wave's core team and treated with indifference. His operational style blends calculated strategic thinking with a flair for dramatic public gestures, as demonstrated by Rogue Wave's hijacked television broadcasts and elaborate recruitment scavenger hunts.

    Maya Richardson encounters mind-controlled individuals triggered by the phrase "Rogue Wave" (Interlude MR.1). The Kingdom of Keys discusses the Rogue Wave situation and the spread of Jump and Fly drugs at a leadership meeting at Nobu Fifty Seven in Manhattan.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Sam and Rampart confront gang members at a construction site and discover a connection to Rogue Wave when a dealer named Jackie has a violent reaction to the organization being mentioned (Chapter 128). Sam reports the incident to Captain Plasma and Fury Forge, who express concern about possible mind control. The group later discusses Rogue Wave at the Tacony Music Hall (Chapter 130).

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Main

    Sullivan makes his first personal appearance at a Rogue Wave Jump distribution event at a private marina in Pennsport, wearing a monkey mask and accompanied by Birthday Suit (Chapter 156). He announces free Jump, outlines his binding contract system, and activates hidden operatives to expose undercover cops and vigilantes. In the ensuing chaos (Chapter 157), Birthday Suit absorbs ranged attacks to protect him while the Auditors fight their way out. Rogue Wave then hijacks NBC10 and the emergency alert system to broadcast their manifesto with all six core members visible, declaring war on the Kingdom of Keys and revealing their network of approximately one thousand contracted individuals (Chapter 158).

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Interlude (LS.1)

    POV interlude set in June 2025 at Rogue Wave headquarters, including the conference room dubbed the "Nerve Center" and their laboratory. Sullivan analyzes footage of Jordan Westwood triggering a school security guard's contract clause and works to redraft the enforcement clause to avoid violent compulsions, considering philosophical implications of contract language and consciousness. Receives operational reports: Rush Order announces 22% contract distribution increase with 92% retention post-Westwood; Dead Drop provides intelligence on the Kingdom's reduced operations and "erratic" enforcer deployment following their warehouse destruction. Sullivan directs controlled expansion into specific Philadelphia neighborhoods weakened by the Kingdom's losses. Oversees the extraction of a probability assessment power from Jackpot -- Sullivan personally tests the power by flipping coins and asking about probability outcomes. The painful extraction process produces a larger-than-average crystal capable of creating sixty standard Jump doses. Sullivan contemplates the metaphysical implications of consciousness disrupting statistical probability and plans enhanced security for the testing phase of this new variant. Views the Jordan incident as evolutionary pressure forcing system improvement, and the struggle with the Kingdom as natural evolution with Rogue Wave representing adaptation and progress.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Rogue Wave hijacks live television again to announce recruitment for a scientist's assistant, sending candidates on an elaborate scavenger hunt across Philadelphia (Chapter 183). Sullivan and Snake Oil conduct candidate interviews at a Toyota dealership back office (Interlude LS.2), evaluating seventeen finalists who survived the scavenger hunt and signed preliminary contracts. Candidates are assessed for technical competence, ideological alignment, and psychological compatibility. Notable rejects include: Melvin Broderick (pharmaceutical researcher, too institutionalized), Jennifer Walsh/Blackout (electromagnetic abilities, mercenary motivations), David Kim (Army Chemical Corps background raising law enforcement concerns), and Dr. Rebecca Foster (asked uncomfortable questions about organizational structure). The most promising candidate is Aurora Reyes/Pyrausta, a self-taught chemist with fire manipulation abilities who has independently reverse-engineered Jump's chemistry and created her own delivery methods. She reveals that Snake Oil's power crystals produce unusual effects on fire when burned, and controls a flame entity named Espada described as a "tulpa." Snake Oil also proposes collaborating with Dr. Necrosis, a German bioterrorist hiding in Chicago, for viral vectors of Jump enhancement, but Sullivan rejects this on ideological grounds since Necrosis opposes profit-based medical approaches. The final candidate is Elias Franklin/Chimera, who arrives in a wheelchair, holds an incomplete PhD in biochemistry from Penn, uses Fly for mobility enhancement and Jump for regeneration, and reveals connections to the Philly Phreaks. His interview is interrupted at a cliffhanger. Sullivan also monitors the aftermath of Rush Order's staged public confrontation with Bloodhound on South Street (Interlude RS.3/DC.1). Rogue Wave launches a citywide emergency alert scavenger hunt for free Jump samples, causing widespread chaos (Chapter 186).

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Rogue Wave's activities continue in the background as Sullivan maintains operations during the Daedalus prison break arc and the escalating conflict with the Kingdom.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sullivan negotiates a protection arrangement with Sam Small at the Tacony Music Hall after Shrike's home invasion threatens her family (Chapter 205). Arrives with Birthday Suit in an unmarked sedan while Rush Order delivers pizza as a peace offering. Confirms Ben Small's existing protection and agrees to expanded surveillance of locations Sam's associates frequent in exchange for an undefined future favor. Sam cuts Sullivan's hand and mixes their blood to seal the agreement. Rogue Wave subsequently provides surveillance photos of Shrike's followers. After Sam's hospitalization, sends a package confirming protection extends to Shrike's followers and requesting future assistance with Mr. Polygraph.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam fulfills her debt to Rogue Wave by tipping Rush Order about Kingdom evidence disposal at Roxborough Memorial Hospital (Chapter 220). Sullivan recognizes the strategic opportunity and orchestrates a complex operation using a geased private investigator as bait to draw out Mr. Polygraph (Interlude DC.2). Selects Rush Order, Birthday Suit, and Dead Drop as the extraction team. The operation results in the capture of Mr. Polygraph, whose lie-detection power is extracted by Snake Oil at a Camden warehouse -- crystallizing as a blue-green crystal that becomes the raw material for Fly. Sullivan acquires the lie-telling ability for himself through the extracted crystal. Sullivan instructs the team to tip police about Polygraph's location after forty-five minutes. Texts Sam confirming her debt is paid but warns not to involve police in future dealings. Sam and the Auditors speculate Sullivan planned for DVD involvement all along. The operation produces 19 arrests total, including 15 Rogue Wave and 4 Kingdom operatives.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** POV (Interlude LS.3)

    Full origin story. Sullivan was an associate at Whitmore & Associates on the fourteenth floor of the Meridian Financial building when four armed men took approximately thirty hostages in the conference room. The leader declared "We won't hurt any of you, as long as everyone in this room cooperates," and Sullivan's power activated - he experienced a nosebleed and felt the verbal statement become a supernaturally binding contract. He parsed the agreement's asymmetries: the cooperation clause was spatially limited to "this room" while the non-violence clause was absolute. He obtained a restroom break with an escort named Martinez, called 911, and then confronted Martinez in the hallway. Martinez's baton swing was physically prevented by the contract's enforcement. Sullivan incapacitated him with a necktie, gathered intelligence on the gunmen, and awaited the tactical team. All hostages were freed without casualties. In the following three weeks, Sullivan systematically tested his power through small everyday agreements, establishing the core rules: mutual comprehension required, mutual binding on both parties, and precise language determining scope. He resigned from his law firm six months later and purchased a monkey mask from a closing costume shop, feeling a transformative shift upon putting it on. Began recruiting people wronged by broken contracts and failed institutional promises to form Rogue Wave.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Active (off-page)

    Sullivan is currently focused on keeping Rogue Wave together while Mr. Antithesis conducts a rampage through the organization to acquire Fly for re-powering Mr. Polygraph. Sullivan has also acquired Mr. Polygraph's lie-telling power via Snake Oil's extraction.


## Trivia

- Sullivan wears a monkey mask during operations and public appearances, maintaining his Monkey Business persona even during relatively informal settings like candidate interviews.
- His first in-person appearance involved banging metal pans together to get the crowd's attention at the Pennsport marina distribution event.
- Sullivan's contract terms are explicitly laid out and require comprehension, a detail that distinguishes his power from simple mind control and reflects his background in contract law.
- Rogue Wave's operational style under Sullivan reflects his legal background: distribution is run like a legitimate business with vendor support, contracts have explicit terms, and recruitment involves structured interview processes.
- The blood-mixing gesture Sam used to seal their protection agreement was her spontaneous addition, not part of Sullivan's typical contract process. Rush Order and Birthday Suit briefly drew weapons in response before standing down.
- Sullivan's organization operates out of deliberately mundane locations, such as a Toyota dealership back office for candidate interviews, chosen for their lack of surveillance interest.
- Rogue Wave under Sullivan hates the Kingdom of Keys more than any other faction, viewing them as sclerotic bureaucrats with no real ideological values.
- Rogue Wave's headquarters includes a conference room called the "Nerve Center," revealed in LS.1.
- Sullivan's interview process in LS.2 reveals the depth of Rogue Wave's recruitment pipeline: seventeen candidates survived a scavenger hunt before reaching the interview stage, and each was evaluated against explicit criteria of technical competence, ideological alignment, and psychological compatibility.
- In LS.1, Sullivan explicitly considered and rejected a potential collaboration with Dr. Necrosis, a German bioterrorist hiding in Chicago who could have created viral vectors for Jump -- the rejection was purely ideological, as Necrosis opposes profit-based medical approaches, which conflicts with Rogue Wave's anarcho-capitalist foundation.
- Sullivan personally tested Jackpot's probability assessment power by flipping coins, demonstrating his hands-on approach to evaluating new capabilities before committing them to production.
- Interlude LS.3 reveals the Meridian Financial building at 1847 Chestnut Street as the location of his Activation Event. The building is described as "fourteen floors of beige carpeting, fluorescent lighting, and the quiet desperation of people who've made peace with spending their finite lives reviewing spreadsheets."
- During the hostage situation, Sullivan was reviewing a licensing agreement for a pharmaceutical client ("predatory terms disguised as industry standard") at the moment the gunmen arrived - a detail that mirrors his eventual career exploiting contractual language.
- Sullivan kept his personal cell phone hidden when the gunmen collected devices, handing over only his work phone. He used the personal phone to call 911 twice from the restroom.
- The hostage-taker's leader used the phrase "no monkey business" while addressing the hostages, an unintentional foreshadowing of Sullivan's eventual alias.
- Sullivan's first act after discovering his power's enforcement mechanism was to strangle Martinez with a necktie - a weapon that is itself a symbol of corporate professionalism.
- He described the monkey mask purchase as an impulse buy from a costume shop going out of business, but noted that putting it on produced the same psychological shift he felt when first stepping outside the conference room during the hostage situation - "the moment of demarcation."
- Sullivan's recruitment methodology for Rogue Wave specifically targeted "people who've been wronged by broken contracts, failed promises, systems that couldn't or wouldn't hold the powerful accountable" - people with skills, grievances, and nothing left to lose.
- His stated philosophy crystallized after the hostage event: the legal system is "built on a beautiful lie" that contracts mean something, when in truth "contracts mean nothing without enforcement" and "the powerful break agreements whenever it's convenient."
