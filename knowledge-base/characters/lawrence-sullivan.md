## Background

Lawrence Sullivan is the founder and leader of Rogue Wave, a decentralized criminal organization distributing Jump and Fly throughout Philadelphia. Before turning to crime, he was an associate at Whitmore & Associates, a contract law firm on the fourteenth floor of the Meridian Financial building at 1847 Chestnut Street. He specialized in contract law, distinguished by his ability to find loopholes that senior partners missed and his complete lack of interest in firm politics.

His Activation Event occurred during an armed hostage situation at his workplace (detailed in Interlude LS.3). A gunman's verbal declaration - "We won't hurt any of you, as long as everyone in this room cooperates" - crystallized into a supernaturally binding contract that Sullivan parsed for exploitable asymmetries, ultimately using its terms to neutralize the threat. In the weeks that followed, he systematically tested his power through everyday agreements and established its core rules. Six months later he resigned, purchased a monkey mask from a closing costume shop, and began building Rogue Wave - recruiting people wronged by broken contracts and failed institutional promises.

Sullivan built the organization around an anarcho-capitalist ideology opposing the state monopoly on metahuman power. His chief scientist Dr. Felix Ortega (Snake Oil) created Jump (temporary superpowers) and Fly (permanent abilities). Physically, Sullivan is tall and thin with blonde hair, a square jaw, and an artificially perfect face. He maintains the theatrical "Monkey Business" persona during operations and has a candy cigarette habit. By spring 2025, Rogue Wave had signed approximately one thousand contracted individuals in Philadelphia and declared open war on the Kingdom of Keys via a hijacked NBC10 broadcast.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Supernatural Contract Creation** - Sullivan creates binding contracts that supernaturally compel compliance with specific terms. Contracts function as absolute enforcement: a party attempting to violate terms experiences physical inability to execute the forbidden action. Both verbal and written agreements can trigger binding. His Activation Event was itself triggered by a verbal agreement, suggesting the power emerged from the intersection of mortal threat and his professional expertise.
- **Contract Requirements** - Both parties must understand the terms for a contract to bind; if a party does not comprehend, the contract does not take hold. Contract activation is confirmed by a brief eye desync in the signing party. Only Sullivan can break a contract once established. The power exploits the gap between what people think they are agreeing to and what precise words actually specify - not through deception, but through precision of language. Contracts execute "as written" rather than as intended.
- **Acquired Power: Lie-Detection** - Sullivan acquired Mr. Polygraph's lie-detection power after having Snake Oil extract it and process the resulting crystal as Fly. Full extent not yet depicted.

### Limitations

- **Comprehension Requirement** - Contracts only bind those who understand the terms. Agreements made under obvious duress still bind, but agreements with non-comprehending targets do not.
- **Mutual Binding** - The contract binds both parties equally; Sullivan cannot create purely one-sided agreements. During his Activation Event, the non-violence clause protected him but the cooperation clause also restricted his own actions while inside the room.
- **Exploitable Clause Language** - Jordan Westwood demonstrated that contract clauses can be exploited by deliberately triggering enforcement conditions, forcing Sullivan to redraft his contract language.
- **Juvenile Contract Voidability** - As Rachel Small noted, minors can void contracts upon turning 18 - an expiration date on Sullivan's power when applied to underage targets. This is why he relied on a handshake agreement with Sam rather than a formal contract.
- **No Direct Combat Power** - Sullivan's ability is administrative and contractual; he relies on enforcers (particularly Birthday Suit) for personal protection.

### Training & Skills

- Extensive contract law background from Whitmore & Associates, with a specialty in finding loopholes - a skill that directly translates to his supernatural power.
- Sophisticated strategic planner capable of orchestrating complex multi-stage operations with contingency planning.
- Skilled organizational manager running Rogue Wave as a decentralized network with specialized roles and clear chains of command.
- Philosophically literate, drawing on anarcho-capitalist and libertarian theory to frame Rogue Wave's operations.

## Personality

Sullivan is calm, analytical, and unflinchingly rational under pressure. During his Activation Event, he was the only hostage who did not panic, parsing the gunman's verbal agreement with professional detachment. His worldview crystallized afterward: the legal system was "built on a beautiful lie" that contracts mean something, when the powerful break agreements whenever convenient. His power allowed him to build something where "contracts actually mean something."

He is theatrical and philosophical, combining seasoned business efficiency with carnival-barker showmanship. He frames Rogue Wave's drug distribution as the democratization of power rather than criminal enterprise, viewing government control of metahuman abilities as a disaster. He treats setbacks as evolutionary pressure rather than defeats. LS.1 reveals a more contemplative side - he is genuinely fascinated by the metaphysical question of whether conscious observation disrupts statistical probability (prompted by Jackpot's power). His interview process in LS.2 shows methodical patience, evaluating candidates across a full day with clear rubrics.

Despite the philosophical framing, Sullivan has a ruthless streak. He celebrated a police officer's death during Rogue Wave's citywide scavenger hunt chaos and maintains an "illusion of collaborative decision-making" while controlling all strategic decisions. He sacrificed fifteen contracted foot soldiers during the Roxborough Memorial operation as acceptable losses. He also honors his contracts scrupulously - arrested contractors receive extra Jump compensation, earning subordinates' respect.

He respects competence and conviction regardless of faction, calling Sam "even smarter than I thought" after she tipped both Rogue Wave and the DVDs about Roxborough. He rejected a potential Dr. Necrosis collaboration on ideological grounds despite tactical advantages. He is seeing Birthday Suit romantically - known to all of Rogue Wave's core team and treated with indifference.

Announces free Jump, outlines his binding contract system, and orders distributors to restrain police and vigilantes present. In the ensuing chaos (Ch. 157), Birthday Suit redirects all attacks aimed at Sullivan to herself while the Auditors fight their way out. Rogue Wave then hijacks NBC10 and the emergency alert system to broadcast their manifesto with all six core members visible, declaring war on the Kingdom and revealing their network of approximately one thousand contracted individuals (Ch. 158).

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Interlude (LS.1)

    POV interlude set in June 2025 at Rogue Wave headquarters (the "Nerve Center" conference room and laboratory). Sullivan analyzes footage of Jordan Westwood triggering a school security guard's contract clause and works to redraft enforcement language. Receives operational reports: Rush Order announces 22% contract distribution increase with 92% retention; Dead Drop provides intelligence on the Kingdom's reduced operations and "erratic" enforcer deployment. Directs controlled expansion into Philadelphia neighborhoods weakened by the Kingdom's losses. Oversees extraction of a probability assessment power from Jackpot - the painful process produces a larger-than-average crystal capable of sixty standard Jump doses. Sullivan personally tests it by flipping coins. Contemplates whether conscious observation disrupts statistical probability and plans enhanced security for the new variant's testing phase.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Rogue Wave hijacks live television again to announce recruitment for a scientist's assistant, sending candidates on an elaborate scavenger hunt (Ch. 183). Sullivan and Snake Oil conduct interviews at a Toyota dealership back office (Interlude LS.2), evaluating seventeen finalists who survived the scavenger hunt. Candidates assessed for technical competence, ideological alignment, and psychological compatibility. Notable rejects include Melvin Broderick (too institutionalized), Jennifer Walsh/Blackout (mercenary motivations), David Kim (law enforcement concerns), and Dr. Rebecca Foster (uncomfortable questions about organizational structure). The most promising candidate is Aurora Reyes/Pyrausta, who has independently reverse-engineered Jump and controls a flame tulpa named Espada. Snake Oil proposes collaborating with Dr. Necrosis for viral Jump vectors; Sullivan rejects this on ideological grounds. Final candidate is Elias Franklin/Chimera - incomplete PhD from Penn, wheelchair user who employs Fly for mobility and Jump for regeneration, with connections to the Philly Phreaks. His interview is interrupted at a cliffhanger. Sullivan also monitors Rush Order's public fight with Bloodhound and the Gun Dad shooting, celebrating the resulting chaos (Interlude RS-DC-JF). Rogue Wave launches a citywide emergency alert scavenger hunt for free Jump, causing widespread chaos (Ch. 187).

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Rogue Wave maintains operations in the background during the Daedalus prison break and escalating Kingdom conflict.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Negotiates a protection arrangement with Sam at the Tacony Music Hall after Shrike's home invasion (Ch. 205). Arrives with Birthday Suit in a dinged-up black sedan while Rush Order delivers pizza disguised as a driver. Confirms Ben Small's existing protection - standing orders for Rogue Wave associates tri-state to watch Ben since Rush Order's video - and agrees to expanded surveillance of Sam's associates' locations in exchange for an undefined future favor. Sam cuts Sullivan's palm with her tooth during the handshake, prompting Rush Order (oversized revolver) and Birthday Suit (modern boxy pistol) to draw weapons before standing down. Rogue Wave subsequently provides approximately twenty professional surveillance photos of Shrike (Ch. 207). After Sam's hospitalization, delivers an envelope via hospital mail: "Mr. Polygraph. We'll be in touch" (Ch. 210).

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam fulfills her debt by tipping Rush Order about Kingdom evidence disposal at Roxborough Memorial Hospital (Ch. 220). Sullivan orchestrates a complex operation using a geased private investigator as bait to draw out Mr. Polygraph (Interlude DC.2). Selects Rush Order, Birthday Suit, and Dead Drop as the extraction team. The operation captures Mr. Polygraph, whose lie-detection power is extracted by Snake Oil at a Camden safehouse - crystallizing as a blue-green, fist-sized crystal after approximately ninety seconds of agonizing contact. Sullivan orders it processed as Fly immediately for himself. Polygraph is dumped at a Camden police station. Texts Sam confirming her debt is paid but warns against calling cops on Rogue Wave again. The operation produces 19 arrests total (15 Rogue Wave, 4 Kingdom); Sam and the Auditors speculate Sullivan planned for DVD involvement, sacrificing fifteen expendable foot soldiers to ensure the Kingdom lost Polygraph.

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** POV (Interlude LS.3)

    Full origin story. Sullivan was reviewing a licensing agreement ("predatory terms disguised as industry standard") when four armed men took approximately thirty hostages in the conference room. The leader declared "We won't hurt any of you, as long as everyone in this room cooperates" - and Sullivan's power activated with a nosebleed. He parsed the agreement's asymmetries: the cooperation clause was spatially limited to "this room" while the non-violence clause was absolute. He obtained a restroom break with escort Martinez, stepped through the doorway (dissolving the cooperation clause), called 911 from his hidden personal cell, then confronted Martinez. Martinez's baton swing was physically prevented by the contract; Sullivan incapacitated him with a necktie. The leader had used the phrase "no monkey business" while addressing the hostages. All hostages were freed without casualties after the tactical team arrived eleven minutes later. In the following three weeks, Sullivan tested his power through small everyday agreements, establishing the core rules: mutual comprehension required, mutual binding, precise language determining scope. He resigned six months later. The monkey mask from a closing costume shop produced the same psychological shift he felt stepping outside the conference room - "the moment of demarcation."

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Active (off-page)

    Focused on keeping Rogue Wave together while Mr. Antithesis works to acquire Fly for re-powering Mr. Polygraph. Sullivan has acquired Polygraph's lie-detection power via Fly.


## Trivia

- Banged metal pans together to get the crowd's attention at his first in-person appearance (Pennsport marina).
- Rogue Wave's operational style reflects his legal background: distribution run like a legitimate business with vendor support, explicit contract terms, and structured interview processes.
- Operates out of deliberately mundane locations (Toyota dealership back office) chosen for their lack of surveillance interest.
- The Nerve Center's circular table has no head position - a meritocratic design choice consistent with his ideological branding.
- Has picked up Yiddish phrases from "a friend," which occasionally confuses his subordinates.
- Uses a $275 fountain pen and an Italian leather folio, which he considers "justifiable expenses."
- The Meridian Financial building is described as "fourteen floors of beige carpeting, fluorescent lighting, and the quiet desperation of people who've made peace with spending their finite lives reviewing spreadsheets."
