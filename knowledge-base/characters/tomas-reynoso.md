## Background

Tomás "Tommy" Reynoso is a former casino pit boss and recovering gambling addict who gained metahuman abilities after being left to die in the desert by his former employers. The precise circumstances of his activation event remain largely undocumented, though the experience evidently transformed both his physiology and his outlook on life. Rather than harboring resentment over his near-death experience, Reynoso adopted a philosophy that treats existence itself as the ultimate game of chance.

Reynoso joined Rogue Wave at some point prior to the organization's public emergence in Philadelphia and became one of the six core members of its leadership team. His unique power profile — a constantly cycling rotation of random abilities — made him indispensable to the group's operations. Dr. Felix Ortega (Snake Oil) regularly extracts Reynoso's manifesting powers through a painful crystallization process, producing the raw material that is then refined into Jump, the temporary power-granting street drug central to Rogue Wave's mission of democratizing superhuman abilities. Unlike many of the organization's contracted operatives, Reynoso is a fully willing participant who understands his role as a living resource and embraces it without reservation.

Reynoso was first identified by name when Jordan Westwood reported intelligence gathered during an infiltration of a Rogue Wave distribution event at a marina, noting that a person called "Jackpot" was essential to Jump production. He subsequently appeared as one of the six featured members of Rogue Wave's televised manifesto broadcast when the organization hijacked NBC10 and the emergency alert system to declare war on the Kingdom of Keys. Sam Small later invoked Jackpot's name as a fabricated handler during an elaborate deception operation in which she impersonated the vigilante Soot, a claim that Kingdom operative Mrs. Quiet confirmed as referencing a real Rogue Wave operative.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Randomized Power Manifestation** — Reynoso's primary ability is the spontaneous generation of random superpowers that cycle periodically. Each manifestation is entirely unpredictable; documented examples include super strength, telekinesis, enhanced senses, and probability assessment. He can never predict which power will appear next, but the powers are described as almost always being at least somewhat useful.
- **Probability Assessment** (temporary manifestation) — During a documented extraction session in June 2025, Reynoso manifested the ability to assess probability outcomes. Lawrence Sullivan tested this power by flipping coins and querying Reynoso about the results. This particular manifestation produced a larger-than-average crystal capable of generating approximately sixty standard Jump doses.

### Limitations

- Each power manifestation lasts exactly three hours, fourteen minutes, and fifteen seconds (3:14:15) before cycling to a new ability.
- Reynoso cannot predict, choose, or influence which power will manifest next.
- The extraction process performed by Snake Oil is described as painful for both parties — the power crystallizes out of Snake Oil's hands during direct physical contact.
- Once a power is extracted, it is no longer available to Reynoso for the remainder of that cycle.
- While his powers are almost always useful, there is no guarantee of combat applicability in any given cycle.

### Training & Skills

- Former casino pit boss with extensive knowledge of gambling operations, probability, and risk assessment.
- Demonstrates rapid adaptability, having learned to quickly assess and utilize whatever random power manifests during a given cycle.
- Possesses calculating intelligence beneath his casual demeanor, allowing him to operate effectively in high-stakes tactical situations.

## Personality

Reynoso treats life like a casino game — unpredictable but riggable. He is a thrill-seeker with a casual, joking demeanor that masks a sharply calculating intelligence underneath. He is consistently described as the least serious member of Rogue Wave's core team, providing levity in an organization otherwise populated by ideologues, professionals, and obsessives. During downtime, he has been observed playing Mario Kart at the Camden safehouse and returning from food runs with Dead Drop during team meetings.

Despite his easygoing surface, Reynoso is not a passive participant in Rogue Wave's operations. He understands clearly that he functions as the organization's most critical resource — the renewable engine of their entire Jump production pipeline — and accepts this role willingly. He is not framed as a victim exploited for his abilities but as someone who genuinely believes in what Rogue Wave is doing and loves the work. His gambling background informs his worldview: he sees risk, chance, and adaptation as the fundamental mechanics of existence, and he has found in Rogue Wave a cause that aligns with that philosophy.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business) | Leader | Sullivan leads Rogue Wave and oversees the strategic application of Reynoso's extracted powers. Tests Reynoso's abilities personally, as documented during the probability assessment extraction. |
| Dr. Felix Ortega (Snake Oil) | Colleague / Extractor | Ortega performs the painful power extraction process on Reynoso, crystallizing his abilities for refinement into Jump. The two work closely and regularly during extraction sessions. |
| Mai-Anh "Annie" Vo (Birthday Suit) | Teammate | Fellow core member of Rogue Wave. Present during team meetings and operations. |
| Dean Carver (Rush Order) | Teammate | Fellow core member of Rogue Wave. Present together during safehouse scenes and team dinners. |
| Renee "Ren" Costello (Dead Drop) | Teammate | Fellow core member of Rogue Wave. The two have been observed returning together from food runs during team gatherings. |
| Elias Franklin (Chimera) | Colleague | Scientific consultant who joined Rogue Wave and assists Snake Oil with extraction procedures and Jump formulation. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Indirect adversary / Unwitting cover | Sam falsely named Jackpot as her Rogue Wave handler during the Phase Two Soot deception. The Kingdom confirmed Jackpot as a real operative, lending credibility to Sam's story. No direct interaction between the two is documented. |

## Arc Appearances

| Book | Role | Key Events |
|------|------|------------|
| Book 10: Plume | Supporting | First identified by name when Jordan Westwood reports intelligence gathered during the Pennsport marina infiltration, noting that a person called "Jackpot" is essential to Jump production (Ch. 158). Appears as one of the six core Rogue Wave members featured in the NBC10 broadcast hijacking, during which the organization declares war on the Kingdom of Keys and reveals its network of contracted operatives. Described as possessing "luck-based powers" during the televised manifesto (Ch. 158). |
| Book 11: Alarm Will Sound | Supporting | Featured prominently in Interlude LS.1, set in June 2025 at Rogue Wave headquarters (including the "Nerve Center" conference room and laboratory). Manifests a probability assessment capability during a strategic planning meeting. Sullivan personally tests the power by flipping coins and asking Reynoso about probability outcomes, confirming its viability. Snake Oil and Jackpot then perform the extraction process in the laboratory: the power crystallizes out of Snake Oil's hands during direct physical contact in a painful procedure for both parties. This particular manifestation produces a larger-than-average crystal capable of generating approximately sixty standard Jump doses, a significantly higher yield than typical extractions. Sullivan calculates the market impact and application potential of this new probability variant and plans enhanced security for the testing phase. The extraction takes place during a broader meeting where the team reports Philadelphia operations exceeding projections, with Rush Order reporting a 22% contract distribution increase. Sullivan contemplates the metaphysical implications of Jackpot's power -- specifically whether conscious observation can disrupt pure statistical probability. Also invoked by name during Sam's Phase Two deception: while impersonating Soot, Sam claims Jackpot is her Rogue Wave handler, which Mrs. Quiet confirms as a real operative, lending critical credibility to the ruse. |
| Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only | Supporting | Present at the Camden safehouse during the Interlude RS/DC/JF sequence, set approximately August 1, 2025. Dead Drop and Jackpot return with food during a team meeting where Rush Order recovers from the gunshot wound sustained during his confrontation with Sam on South Street. Participates in team dinner and philosophical discussion about Rogue Wave's ideology and strategy. |
| Book 14: Shelter in Place | Mentioned | Listed among Rogue Wave operatives in Interlude DC.2, which details the operation to capture and depower Mr. Polygraph at Roxborough Memorial Hospital. Described as playing Mario Kart at the safehouse while the extraction operation is planned and executed. Not part of the combat team for this mission. |
| Book 15: Severe Weather Warning | Mentioned | Referenced as part of ongoing Rogue Wave operations. The Kingdom's interception and tainting of Rogue Wave Jump shipments affects the drug supply chain that depends on Reynoso's extracted powers. |
| Book 16: Category Five Hurricane | Supporting | Currently helping to hold Rogue Wave together while Mr. Antithesis conducts a rampage through the organization's ranks to acquire Fly for re-powering Mr. Polygraph. Status described as active alongside Monkey Business, Birthday Suit, and Snake Oil. |

## Trivia

- The duration of Reynoso's power cycles — exactly 3 hours, 14 minutes, and 15 seconds — corresponds to the digits of pi (3.14159...), suggesting a mathematical or cosmic precision underlying his otherwise random ability.
- His codename "Jackpot" is a direct reference to his gambling background and the slot-machine-like randomness of his power manifestations.
- During the Rogue Wave NBC10 broadcast, Jackpot's powers were described to the public as "luck-based," a simplification of his actual randomized power cycling.
- Reynoso was observed playing Mario Kart during the planning phase of the Mr. Polygraph extraction operation, reinforcing his characterization as the most laid-back member of the core team.
- Sam Small's decision to name Jackpot as her supposed Rogue Wave handler during the Phase Two Soot deception was a calculated choice — it relied on the Kingdom already having intelligence on Jackpot as a real operative, which Mrs. Quiet confirmed on the spot.
- The character reference guide explicitly states Reynoso is "not a victim," distinguishing him from characters who might be sympathetically framed as exploited for their powers. He knows he is a resource and chooses the role freely.
- The probability assessment crystal extracted in LS.1 was notably larger than average, producing approximately sixty standard doses compared to typical extractions. Sullivan viewed this as a significant addition to Rogue Wave's Jump variant portfolio.
- Sullivan's fascination with the metaphysical implications of Reynoso's probability assessment power -- whether consciousness itself can disrupt statistical probability -- represents one of the few times Sullivan's philosophical interests extend beyond contract theory and market ideology into genuinely abstract territory.
- The extraction process is described as painful for both Reynoso and Snake Oil, with the crystal growing from the backs of Snake Oil's hands during physical contact. The mutual pain underscores the collaborative sacrifice at the center of Rogue Wave's production model.
