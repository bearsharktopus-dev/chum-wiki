## Background

Tomas "Tommy" Reynoso is a former casino pit boss and recovering gambling addict who gained metahuman abilities after being left to die in the desert by his former employers. Rather than harboring resentment, he adopted a philosophy that treats existence itself as the ultimate game of chance.

Reynoso joined Rogue Wave prior to the organization's public emergence in Philadelphia and became one of the six core members of its leadership team. His unique power profile - a constantly cycling rotation of random abilities - made him indispensable to the group's operations. Dr. Felix Ortega (Snake Oil) regularly extracts Reynoso's manifesting powers through a painful crystallization process, producing the raw material refined into Jump. Reynoso is a fully willing participant who understands his role as a living resource and embraces it without reservation.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Randomized Power Manifestation** - Reynoso spontaneously generates random superpowers that cycle every three hours, fourteen minutes, and fifteen seconds. Each manifestation is entirely unpredictable but described as almost always at least somewhat useful. Documented examples include probability assessment, botanical telepathy, and a musical ability.
- **Probability Assessment** (temporary manifestation) - During a documented extraction session (Interlude LS.1), Reynoso sensed the mathematical probability of everything happening around him simultaneously, perceiving weighted likelihoods of all outcomes. Each person created a "divot" in the probability field where random chance behaves differently. This manifestation produced a larger-than-average crystal capable of generating approximately sixty standard Jump doses.
- **Botanical Telepathy** (temporary manifestation) - A prior cycle gave Reynoso the ability to hear plants growing. Snake Oil deemed it useless, though Sullivan ordered extraction preparations regardless.

### Limitations

- Reynoso cannot predict, choose, or influence which power will manifest next.
- Once a power is extracted, it is no longer available to him for the remainder of that cycle.
- The extraction process is painful for both Reynoso and Snake Oil - Snake Oil presses his palm against Reynoso's forearm and the power crystallizes out of the back of Snake Oil's hand. Both men use bite blocks during the procedure.
- While his powers are almost always useful, there is no guarantee of combat applicability in any given cycle.

### Training & Skills

- Former casino pit boss with extensive knowledge of gambling operations, probability, and risk assessment.
- Demonstrates rapid adaptability, quickly assessing and utilizing whatever random power manifests.
- Possesses calculating intelligence beneath his casual demeanor.

## Personality

Reynoso treats life like a casino game - unpredictable but riggable. He is a thrill-seeker with a casual, joking demeanor that masks a sharply calculating intelligence. He is consistently the least serious member of Rogue Wave's core team, providing levity in an organization otherwise populated by ideologues, professionals, and obsessives. His gambling background informs his worldview: he sees risk, chance, and adaptation as the fundamental mechanics of existence, and he has found in Rogue Wave a cause that aligns with that philosophy.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business) | Leader | Leads Rogue Wave and oversees strategic application of Reynoso's extracted powers. |
| Dr. Felix Ortega (Snake Oil) | Colleague / Extractor | Performs the power extraction process on Reynoso, crystallizing his abilities for refinement into Jump. |
| Mai-Anh "Annie" Vo (Birthday Suit) | Teammate | Fellow core member of Rogue Wave. |
| Dean Carver (Rush Order) | Teammate | Fellow core member of Rogue Wave. |
| Renee "Ren" Costello (Dead Drop) | Teammate | Fellow core member of Rogue Wave. |
| Elias Franklin (Chimera) | Colleague | Scientific consultant who assists Snake Oil with extraction procedures and Jump formulation. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Indirect adversary | Sam falsely named Jackpot as her Rogue Wave handler during the Phase Two Soot deception; the Kingdom confirmed Jackpot as a real operative, lending credibility to Sam's story. No direct interaction documented. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 10: Plume"

    **Role:** Supporting

    First identified by name when Jordan Westwood reports intelligence gathered during the Pennsport marina infiltration, describing Jackpot as having a "casino dealer aesthetic" and being key to Jump production (Ch. 158). Appears as one of the six core Rogue Wave members featured in the NBC10 broadcast hijacking, during which the organization declares war on the Kingdom of Keys and reveals its network of contracted operatives (Ch. 158).

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Featured prominently in Interlude LS.1 at Rogue Wave headquarters (including the "Nerve Center" conference room and laboratory). Jackpot's previous power - botanical telepathy, the ability to hear plants growing - is considered useless by Snake Oil, but Sullivan still orders extraction preparations. During the meeting, Jackpot's power cycles to a probability assessment capability. Sullivan personally tests the power by flipping a quarter and asking Reynoso about probability outcomes, confirming its viability. Reynoso describes the experience as "like having a hundred betting tables in my head at once." Snake Oil and Jackpot then perform the extraction process in the laboratory: Snake Oil presses his palm against Jackpot's forearm and the power crystallizes out of the back of Snake Oil's hand in a painful procedure for both parties, lasting four minutes and twenty-seven seconds. This particular manifestation produces a larger-than-average crystal - golden-amber, semi-translucent, with a branching dendritic structure approximately the size of a small apple - capable of generating approximately sixty standard Jump doses, a significantly higher yield than typical extractions. The extraction takes place during a broader meeting where the team reports Philadelphia operations exceeding projections, with Rush Order reporting a 22% contract distribution increase. Sullivan contemplates the metaphysical implications of Jackpot's power - specifically whether conscious observation can disrupt pure statistical probability. Also invoked by name during Sam's Phase Two deception: while impersonating Soot, Sam claims Jackpot is her Rogue Wave handler, which Mrs. Quiet later confirms as a real Rogue Wave operative, lending critical credibility to the ruse.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the Camden safehouse during the Interlude RS/DC/JF sequence. Dead Drop and Jackpot return with Chinese food and energy drinks during a team meeting where Rush Order recovers from the gunshot wound sustained during his confrontation with Sam on South Street. Described as humming tunelessly (his current musical power set to wear off in twenty minutes) and struggling with the energy drink case. Participates in team dinner and banter, asking Rush Order if getting shot was "worth it" and reacting with appreciation to Bloodhound's tooth-knuckle fighting technique ("That is so metal").

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at the Camden safehouse in Interlude DC.2, playing Mario Kart against Dead Drop (losing badly) when Rush Order receives Sam Small's tip about Kingdom evidence disposal at Roxborough Memorial Hospital. Not part of the combat team deployed for the subsequent operation to capture and depower Mr. Polygraph. After the operation, scrolls his phone looking defeated while Dead Drop celebrates her Mario Kart tournament victory by controlling the safehouse stereo.


## Trivia

- The duration of Reynoso's power cycles - exactly 3 hours, 14 minutes, and 15 seconds - corresponds to the digits of pi (3.14159...), suggesting mathematical precision underlying his otherwise random ability.
- His codename "Jackpot" references his gambling background and the slot-machine-like randomness of his power manifestations.
- Jordan Westwood's intelligence from the Pennsport marina described Jackpot as having a "casino dealer aesthetic" - tan, greased hair, peach fuzz mustache.
- Sullivan's fascination with whether consciousness can disrupt statistical probability (prompted by the probability assessment extraction) represents one of the few times his philosophical interests extend beyond contract theory and market ideology into genuinely abstract territory.
