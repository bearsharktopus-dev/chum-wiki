## Background

Natalie, operating under the codename Egalitarian, is a key member of Pattinson's Pals and a long-standing romantic partner of Patriot (Richard Johnson). She has been part of Patriot's inner circle for years, present alongside Sean (Bulldozer) at Richard Johnson Sr.'s funeral (Interlude RJ.1), where Patriot's narration describes her as his "almost-daughter-in-law."

Egalitarian possesses a vertigo-inducing power that selectively incapacitates non-powered individuals while leaving metahumans unaffected. Physical evidence obtained by Devonte Harris and Akilah Washington revealed she secretly uses the drug Fly - deeply hypocritical given the Pals' anti-metahuman platform. Whether her vertigo power is natural or Fly-derived remains an open question.

After Patriot departed the Pals to join the Argus Corps, Egalitarian continued operating in Philadelphia, co-organizing civilian defense patrols with Parabellum during the Book 9 arson crisis.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Vertigo Induction** - Deploys an area-of-effect power that causes disorientation and vertigo, incapacitating those within range. The effect is potent enough to drop an entire gymnasium of people. The power manifests as an invisible aura with only a faint distortion visible in the air close to her skin.
- **Selective Targeting** - Her power exclusively affects non-powered individuals. Metahumans (including Sam Small and Jordan Westwood) remained standing and fully functional while everyone else in the homecoming gymnasium was incapacitated - students, teachers, security guards, and even the Pals' own police escort. This suggests the ability targets a biological mechanism that is absent or altered in metahumans, and inadvertently identifies anyone left standing as having powers.

### Limitations

- Her power has no effect on metahumans, making her ineffective in direct confrontations with powered opponents.
- The mechanism of her selective targeting is not fully understood - whether she consciously selects targets or the power inherently discriminates is unknown.
- If her vertigo power is Fly-derived rather than natural, losing access to Fly would render her powerless.

### Training & Skills

- Experienced street-level vigilante and community organizer, capable of coordinating large-scale civilian patrols.

## Personality

Egalitarian is quiet, observant, and projects a cold, inscrutable presence described as "coiled predatory grace." She barely speaks, but when she does it is sharp and cutting. She is comfortable with authoritarian enforcement methods - deploying her vertigo against a gymnasium of teenagers without hesitation (Ch. 112) and endorsing Parabellum's surveillance-state views without objection (Ch. 141). At Patty's Bar, she shows occasional subtle skepticism of Patriot, suggesting she is not an entirely uncritical follower.

The central contradiction of her character is the gap between the Pals' anti-metahuman platform and her secret Fly use. Whether this reflects cynical manipulation, addiction, or something more complicated is unexplored.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Richard Johnson (Patriot) | Romantic Partner / Teammate | Long-standing partnership. Patriot appeared genuinely surprised by the Fly evidence, suggesting he did not know about her drug use. |
| Sean (Bulldozer) | Teammate | Fellow Pals core member since at least Richard Johnson Sr.'s funeral. |
| Parabellum | Teammate | Co-organized civilian defense patrols during the Book 9 arson crisis. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary | Recognized Sam by name at Patty's Bar. Sam was unaffected by Egalitarian's vertigo and later used Fly evidence as leverage against Patriot. |
| Devonte Harris (Ventriloquist) | Adversary (indirect) | Together with Akilah, provided the physical evidence proving Egalitarian's Fly use. |
| Akilah Washington (Marionette) | Adversary (indirect) | Together with Devonte, presented the Fly evidence to Sam at the Tacony Music Hall. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at Patty's Bar when Sam and Jordan infiltrate it, recognizing Sam by name and quietly confronting them in the parking lot alongside Patriot (Ch. 104). Observed by Sam entering the Pals' river warehouse with Patriot, Zero, and others during surveillance operations; Derek separately discovers embarrassing and incriminating materials in Egalitarian's garbage, including receipts contradicting her claimed whereabouts (Ch. 111). Storms the Tacony Charter homecoming dance with Patriot and a phalanx of police in full tactical gear, deploying her vertigo power on the gymnasium crowd and incapacitating everyone without superpowers while Sam and Jordan remain standing (Ch. 112). Jordan escapes by ducking under Egalitarian's grasping hands. Devonte and Akilah provide physical evidence - dried blood containing Fly traces and a grainy photograph of Egalitarian injecting herself - proving her drug use (Ch. 116). Visible on stage at the Dilworth Park rally flanking Patriot in her dazzle camo bodysuit (Ch. 117). Sam uses the Fly evidence as leverage against Patriot during their midnight meeting at Penn Treaty Park, bluffing a friendship with DA Alvarez to secure a mutual non-aggression pact (Ch. 118). Also appears in Interlude RJ.1 (Patriot's backstory) as "Natalie," present at Richard Johnson Sr.'s funeral alongside Sean, where Patriot describes her as his romantic partner.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

    **Role:** Minor

    Co-organizes civilian defense patrols with Parabellum in response to Aaron McKinley's arson campaign. Melissa Marshall invites Sam to the community defense walks organized by Egalitarian and Parabellum. Egalitarian appears out of costume - short black hair, lean muscular frame - and immediately recognizes Sam, creating a tense, silent standoff. Sam is bewildered that Melissa doesn't seem to remember Egalitarian was involved in the homecoming attack. Concerning surveillance-state views are expressed during the walk (Ch. 141).


## Trivia

- Her real name, Natalie, is revealed through the Interlude RJ.1 flashback, where Patriot describes her and Sean as "a well-oiled machine."
- Her codename is ironic given the Pals' discriminatory ideology and her secret drug use to maintain an advantage over the people she claims to protect.
- Whether her vertigo power is natural or Fly-derived is an open thread (Thread 18, Books 6-7): exposure would render her powerless if it comes from Fly.
- During the homecoming "Spartacus moment," teachers and students fought through her vertigo to form a human barrier, demonstrating her power can be partially resisted through sheer willpower.
- Whether the homecoming crowd noticed Sam and Jordan's immunity to her vertigo - which would reveal their superhuman status - remains ambiguous.
