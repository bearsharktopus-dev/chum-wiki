## Background

Natalie, operating under the codename Egalitarian, is the co-leader of Pattinson's Pals alongside Patriot (Richard Johnson). She was present at the funeral of Richard Johnson Sr. in 2017 along with fellow teammate Sean (later known as Bulldozer), establishing that she has been part of Patriot's inner circle for years before the events of the main story.

Egalitarian possesses a vertigo-inducing power that selectively incapacitates non-powered individuals while leaving metahumans unaffected. This unusual mechanic -- targeting a biological mechanism absent in metahumans -- makes her power function as the inverse of most combat abilities in the setting, rendering her effective against civilians and baseline humans but useless against powered opponents.

Physical evidence obtained by Devonte Harris and Akilah Washington revealed that Egalitarian secretly uses the drug Fly, a substance that grants temporary superpowers. This discovery is deeply hypocritical given that Pattinson's Pals publicly position themselves as opponents of metahuman threats. Sam Small used this evidence as leverage during her negotiation with Patriot, threatening to expose Egalitarian's Fly use to DA Alvarez. Whether Egalitarian's vertigo power is her natural ability or was granted by Fly use remains an open question.

After Patriot departed the Pals to join the Argus Corps, Egalitarian continued operating in Philadelphia. During the Book 9 arson crisis, she co-organized civilian defense patrols with fellow Pals member Parabellum, positioning the group as community protectors while expressing concerning surveillance-state views.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Vertigo Induction** -- Deploys an area-of-effect power that causes disorientation and vertigo, incapacitating those within range. The effect is potent enough to drop an entire gymnasium of people.
- **Selective Targeting** -- Her power exclusively affects non-powered individuals. Metahumans (including Sam Small and Jordan Westwood) remained standing and fully functional while everyone else in the homecoming gymnasium was incapacitated. This suggests the ability targets a biological mechanism that is absent or altered in metahumans.

### Limitations

- Her power has no effect on metahumans, making her ineffective in direct confrontations with powered opponents.
- The mechanism of her selective targeting is not fully understood -- whether she consciously selects targets or the power inherently discriminates is unknown.
- If her vertigo power is Fly-derived rather than natural, losing access to Fly would render her powerless.

### Training & Skills

- Long-standing operational experience as a member of Pattinson's Pals, including street-level vigilante work and community organizing.
- Capable of coordinating large-scale civilian patrols and public-facing community defense operations.

## Personality

Egalitarian's personality is not extensively documented through direct characterization. Her actions suggest a figure comfortable with authoritarian enforcement methods -- she deployed her vertigo power against an entire gymnasium full of teenagers and civilians during the homecoming attack without apparent hesitation. Her co-organization of civilian defense patrols during the arson crisis, while ostensibly community-minded, carried undertones of surveillance-state ideology that concerned observers.

The central contradiction of her character is the gap between the Pals' anti-metahuman public platform and her secret Fly use. Whether this hypocrisy reflects cynical manipulation, addiction, or a more complicated relationship with power is not explored in the text.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Richard Johnson (Patriot) | Co-Leader / Partner | Long-standing partnership dating back at least to 2017 (Richard's father's funeral). Co-led Pattinson's Pals together. Patriot appeared not to know about Egalitarian's Fly use when confronted with evidence by Sam. |
| Sean (Bulldozer) | Teammate | Fellow Pattinson's Pals member. Present alongside Natalie at Richard Johnson Sr.'s funeral in 2017. |
| Parabellum | Teammate | Fellow Pattinson's Pals member. Co-organized civilian defense patrols during the Book 9 arson crisis. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary | Sam obtained evidence of Egalitarian's Fly use and wielded it as leverage against Patriot. Sam was unaffected by Egalitarian's vertigo at the homecoming dance. |
| Devonte Harris (Ventriloquist) | Adversary (indirect) | Devonte provided the physical evidence (dried blood containing Fly traces) proving Egalitarian's drug use. |

## Arc Appearances

| Book | Role | Key Events |
|------|------|------------|
| Book 7: Security | Supporting | Present at Patty's Bar when Sam and Jordan infiltrate it on September 13, confronting them in the parking lot alongside Patriot (Ch. 104). Derek discovers embarrassing and incriminating materials in Egalitarian's garbage during surveillance operations (Ch. 111). Storms the Tacony Charter homecoming dance with Patriot and a police tactical squad, deploying her vertigo power on the gymnasium crowd and incapacitating everyone without superpowers while Sam and Jordan remain standing (Ch. 112). Devonte and Akilah provide physical evidence (dried blood containing Fly traces) proving Egalitarian's drug use (Ch. 116). Sam uses the Fly evidence as leverage against Patriot and exposes it to DA Alvarez (Chs. 117-118). Appears at the Dilworth Park rally flanking Patriot (Ch. 117). Also appears in Interlude RJ.1 (Patriot's backstory) as "Natalie," present at Richard Johnson Sr.'s funeral in 2017 alongside Sean. |
| Book 9: Sheol | Minor | Co-organizes civilian defense patrols with Parabellum in response to Aaron McKinley's arson campaign. Melissa Marshall invites Sam to the community defense walks organized by Egalitarian and Parabellum, during which concerning surveillance-state views are expressed (Ch. 141). |

## Trivia

- Egalitarian's real name, Natalie, is revealed through the Interlude RJ.1 flashback to Patriot's father's funeral, where she and Sean (Bulldozer) are identified as Richard's teammates.
- Her vertigo power's selective effect on non-powered individuals creates an interesting thematic irony: a member of an anti-metahuman vigilante group wields a power that is specifically harmless to metahumans.
- The question of whether her vertigo power is natural or Fly-derived is flagged as an open thread in the plot thread tracker (Thread 18, Books 6-7): "If her primary combat power comes from Fly, exposure would render her powerless."
- During the homecoming "Spartacus moment," teachers and students fought through Egalitarian's disorienting effect to form a human barrier protecting Sam and Jordan, demonstrating that her power can be partially resisted through sheer willpower.
- The text notes some ambiguity about whether the crowd at homecoming noticed Sam and Jordan's immunity to Egalitarian's power, which would have revealed their superhuman status.
- Her name "Egalitarian" is ironic given the Pals' discriminatory ideology and her secret drug use to maintain an advantage over the people she claims to protect.
