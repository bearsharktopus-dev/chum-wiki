??? warning "Background"

    Natasha Sokolov is a Russian-American metahuman who operates under the codename Compass as the navigator and technological specialist of the Tacony Titans, a neighborhood superhero team based in the Tacony section of Northeast Philadelphia. She is the oldest or most responsible child in a Russian immigrant family with a working-class background, and her upbringing instilled in her a DIY mindset and resourcefulness that would later define her role within the team.

    The Tacony Titans were first referenced in Chapter 17 when Sam Small's school friends mentioned the team by name after discovering their basic website. At that time, Compass was listed alongside Bubble, Sandman, Sundial, and a member called Weave. The team formally entered the narrative in Chapter 70 when Sam and Jordan encountered Bubble and Sundial at Wissinoming Park. Compass herself first appeared on-page during the alliance formation meeting in Chapter 80, where the Tacony Titans and the Auditors gathered at the Titans' garage headquarters to coordinate against the Jump drug distribution network. There, she introduced herself and her magnetic field control abilities to the assembled heroes.

    The specific circumstances of Natasha's power activation are not documented. She serves as the team's navigator and tech specialist, providing scavenged or repurposed gadgets to support operations. Her combination of magnetic powers and practical engineering skills makes her a versatile asset in both field reconnaissance and logistical support.

??? note "Powers & Abilities"

    **PERKS Assessment**

    No official PERKS assessment on file.

    **Abilities**

    - **Magnetic Sense** - Possesses an innate magnetic sense that functions as a biological compass, allowing her to perceive magnetic fields and orient herself with precision. This ability makes her a natural navigator, capable of maintaining directional awareness in any environment.
    - **Small Metal Object Manipulation** - Can manipulate small metal objects with enough telekinetic force to cause damage. The upper limit of object size and force output is not documented, but the ability is described as effective in close-quarters situations.
    - **Localized Electronics Disruption** - Can disrupt electronic devices within a localized area, interfering with signals, short-circuiting equipment, or disabling surveillance systems. The exact range and duration of this disruption are not specified.

    **Limitations**

    - The scale of her metal manipulation is limited to small objects; she does not exhibit large-scale ferrokinesis.
    - The range of her electronics disruption is localized, suggesting it requires proximity to the target device.
    - Specific upper limits of her magnetic sense range and the force ceiling of her metal manipulation are not documented.
    - She is a baseline human in terms of physical durability, lacking enhanced strength, regeneration, or other secondary physical enhancements.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Skilled in scavenging, repairing, and repurposing technology, providing her team with improvised gadgets and equipment sourced from salvaged materials.
    - Practical mechanical and technical knowledge developed through her working-class upbringing and DIY mindset.
    - Field experience gained through regular patrols and operations with the Tacony Titans across Northeast Philadelphia.
    - Tactical coordination experience from participating in joint operations with the Auditors, Team Mayfly, and other allied hero groups.

??? warning "Personality"

    Natasha is adventurous, resourceful, and outgoing, approaching problems with a practical, no-nonsense mentality. She uses humor and wit to connect with her teammates while maintaining a pragmatic outlook on the challenges they face. She is a natural problem-solver who favors direct, actionable solutions over extended deliberation.

    Her working-class background and immigrant family experience have shaped a self-reliant disposition. She developed her DIY mindset out of necessity, and this resourcefulness translates directly into her role as the team's tech specialist. She is comfortable operating under pressure and adapts quickly to changing circumstances, whether navigating chaotic battlefield conditions or improvising equipment from whatever materials are available. When the Argus Corps bounty system threatened underage heroes in Arc 12, Compass was noted as considering moving operations underground, demonstrating a willingness to prioritize the team's survival over pride.
