## Background

Natasha Sokolov is a Russian-American metahuman who operates under the codename Compass as navigator and tech specialist of the Tacony Titans, a neighborhood superhero team in the Tacony section of Northeast Philadelphia. She is the oldest or most responsible child in a Russian immigrant family with a working-class background, and her upbringing instilled the DIY resourcefulness that defines her role on the team.

First mentioned alongside the other Titans on their website (Ch. 17), Compass appeared on-page during the Titans-Auditors alliance formation meeting (Ch. 80), where she introduced her magnetic field control abilities. The specific circumstances of her power activation are not documented. Her combination of magnetic powers and practical engineering skills makes her a versatile asset in both field reconnaissance and logistical support.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Magnetic Sense** - Possesses an innate magnetic sense that functions as a biological compass, allowing her to perceive magnetic fields and orient herself with precision. This ability makes her a natural navigator, capable of maintaining directional awareness in any environment.
- **Small Metal Object Manipulation** - Can manipulate small metal objects with enough telekinetic force to cause damage. The upper limit of object size and force output is not documented, but the ability is described as effective in close-quarters situations.
- **Localized Electronics Disruption** - Can disrupt electronic devices within a localized area, interfering with signals, short-circuiting equipment, or disabling surveillance systems. The exact range and duration of this disruption are not specified.

### Limitations

- The scale of her metal manipulation is limited to small objects; she does not exhibit large-scale ferrokinesis.
- The range of her electronics disruption is localized, suggesting it requires proximity to the target device.
- Specific upper limits of her magnetic sense range and the force ceiling of her metal manipulation are not documented.
- She is a baseline human in terms of physical durability, lacking enhanced strength, regeneration, or other secondary physical enhancements.

### Training & Skills

- Skilled in scavenging, repairing, and repurposing technology - she provided the alliance with encrypted earpieces scavenged from behind the NSRA building (Ch. 80).
- Practical mechanical and technical knowledge developed through her working-class upbringing.
- Field and tactical coordination experience from joint operations with the Auditors, Team Mayfly, and other allied groups.

## Personality

Natasha is adventurous, resourceful, and outgoing, approaching problems with a practical, no-nonsense mentality. She uses humor and wit to connect with teammates while maintaining a pragmatic outlook. She is a natural problem-solver who favors direct, actionable solutions over extended deliberation. Comfortable under pressure, she adapts quickly to changing circumstances and is willing to prioritize the team's survival over pride - as when she considered moving operations underground in response to the Safer Streets Initiative bounties.
