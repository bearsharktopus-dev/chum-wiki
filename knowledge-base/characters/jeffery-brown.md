## Background

Jeffery Brown was born on New Year's Eve 1981 in the Strawberry Mansion neighborhood of North Philadelphia to Darling "Knuckle Sandwich" Brown, a boxer, and Madison Brown-Smith, a schoolteacher. His father died of an aneurysm during a championship boxing match when Jeffery was two. Despite economic hardship, Jeffery excelled academically, particularly in physics. At age twelve, he defended his younger sister from a neighborhood gang, sustaining injuries that caused lifelong deficits to his grip strength and left arm. A middle school career day encounter with a physicist cemented his interest in the sciences, and he earned a full-ride scholarship to Temple University, graduating in 2003 with a degree in Physics and eventually earning a PhD.

After graduation, Jeffery took a teaching position at a local public high school. In 2001, he had been severely burned attempting to intervene in a superhuman conflict near campus, leaving lifelong scarring across his torso and arms. In August 2004, while chaperoning a school field trip, he was struck by lightning, activating the latent superpowers the earlier incident had failed to trigger.

Adopting the alias "Professor Franklin" as a tribute to Benjamin Franklin's kite experiment, Jeffery began moonlighting as a vigilante while continuing to teach - combating gang-related activities and mentoring young potential vigilantes. After five years of independent work, he registered as an RSE in 2009 and retired from teaching. In 2016, he founded the Delaware Valley Defenders, uniting heroes across the Delaware Valley. He was killed on March 23, 2017 during his final mission attempting to stop Chernobyl from stealing military-grade munitions from an industrial factory. He died in the rain; Liberty Belle held him as he passed. His memorial at Laurel Hill Cemetery on a snowy day drew superheroes from across the East Coast, former students, and Philadelphia citizens.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | G4/SE/P/T (Immunity), F7/SO/P/V (Electrokinesis) |
| **Category** | Gigant, Filch |
| **Power Ranking** | High (no numeric score on file) |
| **Control** | 7/10 |
| **Hostility** | 0/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 7/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 4/10 |

### Abilities

- **Immunity to Electrocution** - An intrinsic biological trait classified under the Gigant category. Virtually impervious to all forms of electric shocks, up to and including natural lightning strikes. Also appeared to act as a lightning rod during storms, though this effect was difficult to discern except statistically. Classification: G4/SE/P/T.
- **Electrokinetic Storage and Discharge** - Could accumulate electrical energy within his body and discharge it at will as lightning bolts over considerable distances. Aiming was largely restricted to his understanding of electric conductance and grounding principles, but the power's range was classified as Visual (V). Classification: F7/SO/P/V.

### Limitations

- Imprecise aiming for electrical discharges, relying on conductance and grounding rather than fine control, limiting offensive versatility.
- Substantial risk to bystanders and infrastructure at high intensities, contributing to a collateral damage rating of 7/10.
- Lifelong deficits to grip strength and left arm use from the childhood injury defending his sister.
- Lifelong scarring and pain from the 2001 superhuman conflict burns.
- In his final years, showed signs of emotional and physical fatigue from mounting leadership and combat demands.

### Training & Skills

- PhD in Physics from Temple University, informing his combat methodology and mentorship approach.
- Former public high school science educator, skilled in teaching and mentoring young people.
- Devised support items and practical methods to utilize his electrical powers in non-destructive ways, compensating for aiming limitations.
- Introduced innovative cape-fighting methods adopted by local police forces; tapped for tutoring in anti-superhuman tactics by multiple departments.
- Began attending therapy in 2014 and developed an interest in psychology, incorporating therapeutic techniques into his mentorship style.
- Maintained personal intelligence on local villains - knew Shrike's real name (Niles) and subdued him with a precision electrical shock to the neck during the Strawberry Mansion incident.
- A grappler by preference in hand-to-hand combat, favoring closing distance, establishing control, and using electrical contact as a win condition.
- Good reflexes honed from years of interfacing with electricity, sometimes responding before consciously registering a threat.
- Primary author of the DVD Training Curriculum (July 2016), covering team philosophy, physical standards, combat training, investigation methodology, psychological support, and community integration.
- Wore professional, up-to-date Kevlar under a white lab coat with fingerless gloves and round glasses as his costume.

## Personality

Professor Franklin was calm, strategic, and deeply supportive as both a hero and a mentor. He turned serious situations into teaching moments, asking proteges "What did you learn?" after mistakes rather than admonishing them. He stressed how superhero conduct impacts public perception, policy, and legislation, and shared the Benjamin Franklin quote: "By failing to prepare, you're preparing to fail." His ethical grounding was unquestioned - a hostility rating of zero and demonstrated compassion even toward his most vicious enemies.

Jeffery was intellectually humble. His DVD Training Curriculum opened with the admission "We're making this up" and he frequently noted where his methods were incomplete or wrong: "The only way it works is if we're honest about what we don't know." He hired Elijah Brooks as combat instructor after Brooks demonstrated his training methodology was flawed.

Beyond heroic work, Jeffery organized outreach programs to reintegrate former criminals, including reformed supervillains. His rational, multifaceted approach - combining direct intervention, preventive initiatives, and mentorship - set a standard for what an RSE should be, according to his PERKS liaison Officer Thompson.

In Interlude DW.1, he appears in a flashback where he intervenes to save Diane (then operating as Breakout) from Shrike in Strawberry Mansion. Shrike had trapped a family in metal spikes; Diane engaged him but was cornered. Franklin arrived behind Shrike, incapacitated him with an electrical shock to the neck, zip-tied him, and told him: "Niles, you've killed four people and a police officer. This is as over as it gets." He then mentored Diane about strategy, public perception, and the meaning of her alias - advising that "Breakout" reflected destruction rather than protection. In Interlude DW.2, Liberty Belle delivers his eulogy at Laurel Hill Cemetery on a snowy day; Jim Cramer spoke before Belle, and the gathering included superheroes from across the East Coast, former students, and Philadelphia citizens. Chernobyl accuses Belle of being haunted by Franklin's "Dybbuk" and refers to Franklin as Belle's "lover."

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    Sam testifies about Belle feeling "beholden to see things through. Because of Professor Franklin." During Chernobyl's trial, the prosecution details his killing as part of Fedorov's crimes. Dr. Victoria Chen, Franklin's former colleague, testifies and identifies him by first name "Jeffery." The trial establishes his death date as March 23, 2017, at an industrial factory where Fedorov was stealing military-grade munitions. Fedorov is found guilty of manslaughter (not murder) for both Franklin and Belle, as the jury accepted some degree of self-defense argument. Councilman Davis notes the losses of Franklin and Belle leave the DVD "stretched alarmingly thin."

The interlude also depicts Jeffery visiting Knockout Gym to meet Elijah Brooks, who critiques the curriculum and dismantles Jeffery in a sparring match. Jeffery hires Brooks on the spot as lead combat instructor. Mr. Antithesis references Franklin in a separate interlude, noting Sam is "a little too unscrupulous for Professor Franklin, but this is about a decade of semantic drift."
