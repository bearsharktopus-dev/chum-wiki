## Background

Jeffery Brown was born on New Year's Eve 1981 in the Strawberry Mansion neighborhood of North Philadelphia to Darling "Knuckle Sandwich" Brown, a boxer, and Madison Brown-Smith, a schoolteacher. Raised in a low-income household, Jeffery lost his father at age two when Darling died of an aneurysm during a championship boxing match. Despite economic hardship, Jeffery excelled academically, particularly in physics. At age twelve, he defended his younger sister from a neighborhood gang, sustaining injuries that caused lifelong deficits to his grip strength and the use of his left arm. A middle school career day encounter with a physicist cemented his interest in the sciences, and he earned a full-ride scholarship to Temple University, graduating in 2003 with a BSc in Physics.

After graduation, Jeffery took a teaching position at a local public high school, determined to give back to the community that raised him. In August 2004, while chaperoning a school field trip, he was struck by lightning, which activated his latent superpowers. This was not his first brush with superhuman danger -- in 2001, he had been severely burned while attempting to intervene in a superhuman conflict near his campus, leaving him with lifelong scarring and pain across his torso and arms. His lightning strike activated the abilities that the earlier incident had failed to trigger.

Adopting the alias "Professor Franklin" as a tribute to Benjamin Franklin and his famous kite experiment, Jeffery began moonlighting as a vigilante while continuing to teach. He focused on combating gang-related activities and mentoring young potential vigilantes, combining scientific principles with combat techniques. After five years of independent vigilante work, he applied for and was accepted as a Registered Superhuman Entity in 2009, at which point he retired from teaching to focus on superhero work full-time. In 2016, he founded the Delaware Valley Defenders, uniting heroes across the Delaware Valley area. He was killed on December 19, 2017 during his final mission attempting to stop the villain Chernobyl from stealing military-grade munitions from an industrial factory. A memorial service was held on March 18, 2018 at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Strawberry Mansion, attended by superheroes, former students, and Philadelphia citizens from across the region.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | G4/SE/P/T (Immunity), F7/SO/P/V (Electrokinesis) |
| **Category** | Gigant, Filch |
| **Power Ranking** | High (no numeric score on file) |
| **Control** | 7/10 |
| **Hostility** | 0/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 7/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 4/10 |

### Abilities

- **Immunity to Electrocution** - An intrinsic biological trait classified under the Gigant category. Professor Franklin was virtually impervious to all forms of electric shocks, up to and including natural lightning strikes. He also appeared to act as a lightning rod during storms and adverse weather conditions, though this effect was difficult to discern except statistically. Classification: G4/SE/P/T.
- **Electrokinetic Storage and Discharge** - Could accumulate electrical energy within his body and discharge it at will, tied to his electrocution immunity. He could release stored energy as lightning bolts over considerable distances. While his aiming was largely restricted to his understanding of electric conductance and grounding principles, the power's range was classified as Visual (V) due to its reach. Classification: F7/SO/P/V.

### Limitations

- His aiming ability for electrical discharges was imprecise, relying on his understanding of conductance and grounding rather than fine control. This reduced the versatility of his offensive capabilities.
- The imprecise nature of his electrokinetic discharges posed substantial risk to bystanders and infrastructure when used at high intensities, contributing to a collateral damage rating of 7/10.
- He had lifelong deficits to his grip strength and use of his left arm from a childhood injury sustained defending his sister.
- He carried lifelong scarring and pain across his torso and arms from severe burns sustained in a 2001 superhuman conflict.
- In his final years, he showed signs of emotional and physical fatigue from the mounting demands of leadership and combat.

### Training & Skills

- BSc in Physics from Temple University (Class of 2003), providing a strong scientific foundation that informed his combat methodology and mentorship approach.
- Former public high school science educator, skilled in teaching and mentoring young people.
- Devised support items and practical methods to utilize his electrical powers in non-destructive ways, compensating for his aiming limitations.
- Introduced innovative cape-fighting methods that were adopted by local police forces and was tapped for tutoring in anti-superhuman tactics by multiple police departments.
- Began attending therapy in 2014 and developed an interest in psychology, incorporating therapeutic techniques into his mentorship style and approach to his rogues' gallery.
- Maintained personal intelligence on local villains, knowing Shrike's real name (Niles) and subduing him with a precision electrical shock to the neck during the 2015 Strawberry Mansion incident, then zip-tying him for containment transport.
- Wore professional, up-to-date Kevlar under a white lab coat with fingerless gloves and round glasses as his costume.

## Personality

Professor Franklin was calm, strategic, and deeply supportive as both a hero and a mentor. He approached superhero work with thoughtfulness and precision, emphasizing preparation and scientific knowledge in combat. He was known for turning serious situations into teaching moments, famously asking his proteges "What did you learn?" after mistakes rather than admonishing them. He stressed the importance of public perception and how superhero conduct impacts policy and legislation. He advised Diane that her alias "Breakout" reflected destruction rather than protection and shared the Benjamin Franklin quote: "By failing to prepare, you're preparing to fail." His ethical grounding was unquestioned, reflected in a hostility rating of zero and a demonstrated compassion even toward his most vicious enemies.

Beyond his heroic work, Jeffery was a community-minded individual who organized outreach programs to reintegrate former criminals, including reformed supervillains. He attended therapy to manage the mounting stress of his responsibilities and used the techniques he learned to develop greater empathy and stewardship. His rational, multifaceted approach to crime-fighting -- combining direct intervention, preventive initiatives, and mentorship -- set a standard for what a Registered Superhuman Entity should be, according to his PERKS liaison Officer Thompson.
