## Background

Jasmine Walker is a teenage metahuman whose powers activated in approximately May 2025, killing her father during the event. He had been born in 1979, placing him just outside the 1981 threshold for potential superhuman emergence - meaning he could not have developed powers of his own and had no biological defenses against his daughter's manifestation. Jasmine internalized his death as a deeply personal failing, interpreting it through an agnostic divine intervention framework: the cruel randomness of a system that gave her abilities she never asked for while killing the parent who could never have shared them. She does not reveal the circumstances of his death to others.

Following her activation, Jasmine spent approximately three months at the Whitford Institute in Chicago - the only psychiatric inpatient-outpatient facility for powered youth in the country - where her subconscious plant manipulation was treated as a threat rather than a symptom. As she later put it, nobody there ever asked what she wanted to do with her life. She was subsequently transferred to Philadelphia as part of a partial-stay program, where Councilman Jamal Davis identified her as one of four initial cases for his pilot peer mentorship program. In Philadelphia, she resides with a foster mother who works in a medical capacity, while her biological mother holds a demanding, high-paying job that provides financial stability but leaves little time for her daughter.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Chlorokinesis (Plant Manipulation)** - Jasmine influences and directs plant matter in her vicinity. Plants respond to her emotional state on a subconscious, automatic level - particularly feelings of threat - repositioning themselves to shield her. This manifests as branches bending toward her, leaves draping protectively, roots reaching in her direction, and dormant plants spontaneously sprouting.
- **Protective Plant Response** - When startled or frightened, nearby plants physically intercept perceived threats and create barriers. Even dead or dormant plant material responds to her impulses (Pennypack Park, Ch. 222).
- **Escalation Potential (Protection to Harm)** - Her powers can shift from defensive ("protect me") to offensive ("hurt them") if her conscious impulse changes. During the Songbird attack (Ch. 241), plants within the building grew thorns oriented toward the door. Dr. Jensen flagged this escalation potential as high-risk.
- **Area-of-Effect Emotional Broadcast** - During intense fear, her influence extends well beyond her immediate surroundings. During the Songbird attack, hedges within one to two blocks leaned toward the building, weeds pushed through pavement, and a winter-dormant garden began spontaneously sprouting. Sam noted this range as significant and undocumented.

### Limitations

- Her chlorokinesis is currently involuntary and subconscious. She cannot consciously direct plants and has expressed distress over the inability to stop the response once triggered.
- Manipulated plant material retains its structural properties - wood is only as strong as wood - though thorns remain sharp and branches can strike with considerable force.
- Her powers physically construct the emotional barriers she uses to keep people away, creating a feedback loop: fear produces plant walls, plant walls push people away, isolation produces more fear.
- The full upper limits of her range are not yet established; the two-block radius during the Songbird attack is the most extreme documented manifestation.

### Training & Skills

- Participating in mentorship program sessions run by Sam Small and Maggie O'Brien, including group discussions about civilian encounters, de-escalation, and career planning.
- Receiving individual therapy from Dr. Hernandez at the Tacony Community Center.
- Previously received psychiatric treatment at the Whitford Institute.
- Sam has committed to helping Jasmine learn conscious direction of her powers, though progress toward voluntary control has not yet been documented.

## Personality

Jasmine presents a black goth aesthetic that suggests an interest in the macabre, but her actual interests run toward conventionally beautiful things - butterflies and flower arranging. The disconnect is characteristic of her broader pattern: she constructs an exterior designed to keep people at a comfortable distance while privately craving connection she is too afraid to pursue. She is described as the "bad shy" in contrast to Zara Khan's "good shy" - where Zara is quietly curious and willing to engage, Jasmine wants to be perceived as the cool, detached quiet kid in the corner. She sits back, saves up cutting remarks, and performs the role of a quiet curmudgeon until she believes she has something sufficiently clever to contribute.

Beneath the affect is a teenager who craves positive attention but is scared to reach out for it, compounded by her father's death, institutional treatment at Whitford, and a foster placement that provides material stability but little emotional warmth. As of Arc 16, she is described as "very slowly defrosting."

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Arrived at the first full mentorship meeting at the Tacony Music Hall with Davis in Chapter 215, wearing all black with silver beads in her braids, withdrawn and closed-off. The other three mentees demonstrated their powers - Zara lifted a glass marble, Liam shifted his eyes, Alex produced a flame - but Jasmine passed. Sam validated her choice not to demonstrate. She lingered after the session ended but did not speak. Participated in subsequent mentorship sessions at the Music Hall through the remainder of Arc 14, though her specific activities during this period are not detailed.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at a mentorship meeting hosted at Sam's parents' house (Chapter 221), arriving at 11:15 from the bus, late on purpose. When asked how she was doing, said "Fine" and would not elaborate. Described as wearing all black clothes and dark lipstick. Powers revealed to the peer group during a January 2026 training session at Pennypack Park (Chapter 222) when Liam O'Connor slipped and fell toward her - a dead oak tree bent to protect her, its branches catching Liam before he crashed into her. Jasmine had been sitting apart, fifteen feet away from the group, and had said fewer than thirty words total across the previous eight sessions. Sam spoke with Jasmine privately afterward; Jasmine revealed she had possessed the power since her activation in May and that people at Whitford treated her as dangerous. She said, "I just want them to stop moving when I don't want them to." Sam committed to helping her learn conscious control. The Auditors discussed the significance of Jasmine's power reveal at their subsequent Music Hall meeting. Present at mentorship meetings during Sam's fugitive and post-fugitive period. During a mentorship career discussion (Chapter 231), Jasmine arrived by taxi exactly on time, wearing a small enamel butterfly pin in blue and yellow - the most color Sam had ever seen on her. When asked about career goals, she said that at Whitford they had focused on keeping her safe but nobody had ever asked what she wanted to do with her life. She did not know what she wanted yet. Sam told her she was fifteen and allowed not to know. She did not demonstrate her powers, and Sam did not push. During the second meeting that arc, Jasmine was more withdrawn than usual as the situation in the neighborhood worsened.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Attended the Tacony Community Center grand opening in Chapter 233 alongside the other mentorship kids. Receiving individual therapy with Dr. Hernandez at the community center as of Valentine's Day. During the Songbird attack on the Tacony Community Center in March 2026 (Chapter 241), Sam could smell Jasmine's plant growth before reaching the building - hedges straining toward the center, weeds pushing through pavement in February. Inside, Jasmine was in the corner with a ficus draped over her, a spider plant reaching for her, and plants growing thorns oriented toward the door. She told Sam she could not make them stop. Sam talked her through breathing to help her calm down. Sam addressed the mentorship kids about de-escalation and the PR trap - that Songbirds wanted powered kids to fight back so the narrative would become "dangerous superpowered kids attack protestors." Sam specifically noted the racial disparity in how the system would treat Jasmine and Zara compared to white-passing kids. Foster mother arrived last, forty-five minutes after the incident, in scrubs, exhausted and guilty. Jasmine walked to the car without speaking.


## Trivia

- Her enamel butterfly pin in blue and yellow, worn to a later mentorship meeting (Ch. 231), was described as the most color Sam had ever seen on her - a small crack in the all-black goth aesthetic that hints at her actual interest in beautiful things.
- Jasmine represents "kids failed by psychiatric and institutional systems despite those systems genuinely trying to help," positioning her as a thematic counterpoint to characters like Daisy Zhen who were failed by systems that were not trying to help.
- During the career planning discussion, Liam said electrician, Zara said research, Alex said business or drag racing. Jasmine was the only one who said she did not know.
- The Whitford Institute is also where Daisy Zhen was remanded following her emergency legal hearing in Arc 13. It is the only facility of its kind in the country.
- Dr. Jensen flagged three of the four mentorship members (Jasmine, Zara, and Liam); Alex Kirby was the exception, having been referred through Davis's professional connection to his parents.
