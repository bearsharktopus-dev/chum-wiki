## Background

Jasmine Walker is a teenage metahuman whose powers activated in approximately May 2025 under circumstances traumatic enough to require institutional intervention. During the activation event, Jasmine's father was killed. He had been born in 1979, placing him just outside the threshold for potential superhuman emergence (individuals born 1981 and later), meaning he could not have developed powers of his own and had no biological defenses against whatever occurred during his daughter's manifestation. Jasmine internalized her father's death as a deeply personal failing, interpreting it through what the character reference guide describes as "a sort of agnostic divine intervention thing" - the cruel randomness of a system that gave her abilities she never asked for while killing the parent who could never have shared them. She does not reveal the circumstances of her father's death to others.

Following the activation incident, Jasmine was admitted to the Whitford Institute in Chicago, the only psychiatric inpatient-outpatient facility for powered youth in the country. The Whitford intervention indicates that her early power manifestations were sufficiently alarming to require institutional containment and treatment, though not dangerous enough to warrant placement at Aurora Springs Residential Facility. At Whitford, Jasmine's subconscious plant manipulation was treated as a threat rather than a symptom, reinforcing her sense of isolation and the perception that she was dangerous. She was subsequently transferred to Philadelphia as part of a partial-stay program, where she was identified by Councilman Jamal Davis as one of four initial cases for his pilot peer mentorship program.

Jasmine's mother holds a demanding, high-paying job that provides financial stability but leaves little time for her daughter. In Philadelphia, Jasmine resides with a foster mother who works in a medical capacity (arriving at pickups in scrubs) and who has been characterized as arriving late and with limited engagement - her foster mother was the last parent to arrive during the Songbird attack on the community center, showing up forty-five minutes after the incident. Jasmine walked to the car without speaking. The combination of an absent biological mother, a deceased father, institutional upbringing, and a foster placement that appears functionally adequate but emotionally distant has left Jasmine profoundly isolated.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Chlorokinesis (Plant Manipulation)** - Jasmine possesses the ability to influence and direct plant matter in her vicinity. Plants nearby respond to her emotional state, particularly feelings of threat, repositioning themselves to shield her. This manifests as branches bending toward her, leaves draping protectively over her body, roots and grasses reaching in her direction, and dormant plants spontaneously sprouting. The response operates on a subconscious, automatic level tied to her emotional state.
- **Protective Plant Response** - When startled or frightened, nearby plants move to physically intercept perceived threats and create barriers between Jasmine and whatever she perceives as dangerous. During the Pennypack Park training session in January 2026, dead tree branches, bushes, and grass moved to catch Liam O'Connor when he slipped and fell toward her, demonstrating that even dormant or dead plant material responds to her impulses.
- **Escalation Potential (Protection to Harm)** - Jasmine's powers can shift from defensive ("protect me") to offensive ("hurt them") if her conscious impulse changes. During the Songbird attack on the community center, plants within the building grew thorns oriented toward the door - a defensive posture that also constituted a hostile response to the perceived threat outside. Dr. Jensen flagged this escalation potential as high-risk.
- **Area-of-Effect Emotional Broadcast** - During states of intense fear, Jasmine's influence extends well beyond her immediate surroundings. When frightened during the Songbird attack in March 2026, hedges within one to two blocks of the community center leaned toward the building, weeds pushed through pavement, and a winter-dormant garden began spontaneously sprouting - all orienting toward Jasmine's location. Sam Small noted this range as significant and undocumented.

### Limitations

- Jasmine's control over her chlorokinesis is currently involuntary and subconscious. She cannot consciously direct plants and has expressed distress over the inability to stop the response once triggered ("I can't make them stop").
- Plant material manipulated by her power retains its structural properties - wood is only as strong as wood, and her ability cannot make organic material exceed its natural physical limits. However, thorns remain sharp and branches can still strike with considerable force.
- The power creates literal physical barriers between Jasmine and other people, reinforcing her psychological isolation in a feedback loop: fear produces plant walls, plant walls push people away, being pushed away produces more fear.
- The full upper limits of her range and the scope of plant material she can influence are not yet established, though the two-block radius observed during the Songbird attack represents the most extreme documented manifestation.

### Training & Skills

- Participating in mentorship program sessions run by Sam Small and Maggie O'Brien, including group discussions about civilian encounters, de-escalation techniques, and career planning.
- Receiving individual therapy from Dr. Hernandez at the Tacony Community Center.
- Previously received psychiatric treatment at the Whitford Institute, though the nature and focus of that treatment beyond containment is not detailed.
- Sam Small has committed to helping Jasmine learn conscious direction of her powers, though progress toward voluntary control has not yet been documented.

## Personality

Jasmine presents a black goth aesthetic that suggests an interest in the macabre or "creepy," but her actual interests run toward conventionally beautiful things - butterflies and flower arranging among them. The disconnect between presentation and preference is characteristic of her broader behavioral pattern: Jasmine constructs an exterior designed to keep people at a comfortable distance while privately craving the connection she is too afraid to pursue. She is described as the "bad shy" in contrast to Zara Khan's "good shy" - where Zara is quietly curious and willing to engage on topics she knows well, Jasmine wants to be perceived as the cool, detached quiet kid in the corner. She sits back and observes, saves up cutting remarks, and performs the role of a quiet curmudgeon until she believes she has something sufficiently clever to contribute.

Beneath the affect is a teenager who craves positive attention and affection but is scared to reach out for it. This fear is compounded by the trauma of her father's death during her activation, the institutional experience at Whitford where her powers were treated as dangerous, and a home life that provides material stability but little emotional warmth. Her chlorokinesis reinforces this cycle on a physical level - the plants that move to protect her also wall her off from the people around her, creating a visible manifestation of the emotional barriers she has built. At the time of Arc 16, Jasmine is described as "very slowly defrosting," suggesting incremental progress toward trust and openness within the mentorship peer group.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Mentor | Sam runs the mentorship program sessions and validated Jasmine's choice not to demonstrate her powers at the first meeting. After Jasmine's abilities were revealed at Pennypack Park, Sam spoke with her privately and committed to helping her learn conscious control. Sam also directly addressed the racial disparity in how the justice system treats powered youth of color during the Songbird debrief, speaking to Jasmine and Zara specifically. |
| Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) | Mentor (associated) | Co-runs mentorship sessions with Sam. Present during training and group meetings. |
| Jamal Davis | Program Coordinator | City Councilman who identified Jasmine as one of four initial cases for the mentorship pilot program and personally accompanied her to the first meeting at the Tacony Music Hall. |
| Zara Khan | Peer (mentorship) | Fellow mentorship program member. Jasmine and Zara are the two members Sam specifically addressed regarding racial disparities in the system's treatment of powered youth. Zara represents the "good shy" counterpart to Jasmine's "bad shy." |
| Liam O'Connor | Peer (mentorship) | Fellow mentorship program member. Jasmine's chlorokinesis was first revealed to the group when Liam slipped during training at Pennypack Park and plants moved to catch him before he crashed into her. |
| Alex Kirby (Hellhound) | Peer (mentorship) | Fellow mentorship program member. Both share emotionally distant parent situations, though expressed in different ways - Jasmine withdraws while Alex acts out. |
| Dr. Hernandez | Therapist | Provides individual therapy sessions at the Tacony Community Center. Referenced as working with Jasmine during the Valentine's Day community center scene. |
| Dr. Jensen | Assessor | Flagged Jasmine as high-risk due to the protection-to-harm escalation potential of her chlorokinesis. Responsible for referring her to the mentorship program. |
| Jasmine's Father (Deceased) | Father | Born 1979, killed during Jasmine's activation event. His birth year placed him just outside the 1981 threshold for potential powers. Jasmine has internalized his death as a deeply personal wound and does not discuss it. |
| Jasmine's Mother | Mother | Has a demanding, high-paying job that provides financial stability but leaves little time for Jasmine. Not present in Philadelphia - Jasmine is in foster care. |
| Jasmine's Foster Mother | Foster Parent | Works in a medical field (arrives in scrubs). Arrived forty-five minutes late to pick up Jasmine after the Songbird attack on the community center. Jasmine walked to the car without speaking. |
| Mrs. Jennifer Patterson | Community Center Staff | Youth services veteran who stood at the community center door for two hours during the Songbird confrontation, an act Sam held up to the mentorship kids as the model of courage without powers. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Identified by Councilman Davis as one of four initial cases for the mentorship pilot program in Chapter 211, noted as a transfer from the Whitford Institute with powers undisclosed. Arrived at the first mentorship meeting at the Tacony Music Hall with Davis in Chapter 215, withdrawn and closed-off, sitting in the corner. Declined to demonstrate her powers when the other students showed theirs; Sam validated her choice. Participated in subsequent mentorship sessions at the Parkway Central Library and Franklin Park, though her specific training activities during this period are not detailed.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Present at mentorship meetings hosted at Sam's house during the period when the Music Hall was under repair. Powers revealed to the peer group during a January 2026 training session at Pennypack Park (Chapter 222) when Liam O'Connor slipped and fell toward her, triggering an instinctive chlorokinetic response -- dead branches, bushes, and grass moved to intercept him. Sam spoke with Jasmine privately afterward; Jasmine revealed she had possessed the power since her activation in May and that people at Whitford treated her as dangerous. Sam committed to helping her learn conscious control. The Auditors discussed the significance of Jasmine's power reveal at their subsequent Music Hall meeting. Present at mentorship meetings during Sam's fugitive and post-fugitive period. During a mentorship career discussion, was the only member who did not know what she wanted to do professionally.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Attended the Tacony Community Center grand opening alongside the other mentorship kids. Receiving individual therapy with Dr. Hernandez at the community center as of Valentine's Day. During the Songbird attack on the Tacony Community Center in March 2026 (Chapter 241), Jasmine's fear caused plants within a one-to-two-block radius to grow toward her protectively -- hedges leaning toward the building, weeds pushing through pavement, winter-dormant gardens sprouting. Inside the center, a ficus draped over her, a spider plant reached for her, and plants grew thorns oriented toward the door. She told Sam she could not make them stop. Sam addressed the mentorship kids about de-escalation and specifically noted the racial disparity in consequences for Jasmine and Zara. Foster mother arrived last, forty-five minutes late. Sam internally noted the scope of Jasmine's power response as significant and undocumented.


## Trivia

- Jasmine's powers were undisclosed for approximately two months of mentorship sessions before being involuntarily revealed at Pennypack Park, making her the last of the four mentees to have her abilities seen by the group.
- Her father's birth year of 1979 is specifically noted as placing him just before the 1981 threshold for superhuman potential - a two-year gap that Jasmine has internalized as cosmically significant.
- The character reference guide describes Jasmine as representing "kids failed by psychiatric and institutional systems despite those systems genuinely trying to help," positioning her as a thematic counterpoint to characters like Daisy Zhen who were failed by systems that were not trying to help.
- Jasmine's chlorokinesis creates a literalized metaphor: her power physically constructs the emotional barriers she uses to keep people away, with plants forming walls between her and others in direct response to the fear and isolation that drive her withdrawal.
- She is one of two mentorship members (alongside Zara Khan) whom Sam directly addressed regarding the racial disparity in how the justice system treats powered youth of color.
- During the career planning discussion with the mentorship group, Liam said he wanted to be an electrician, Zara said research, and Alex said business or drag racing. Jasmine was the only one who said she did not know.
- The Whitford Institute, where Jasmine was previously housed, is also where Daisy Zhen was remanded following her emergency legal hearing in Arc 13. It is the only facility of its kind in the country.
- Dr. Jensen flagged three of the four mentorship members (Jasmine, Zara, and Liam); Alex Kirby was the exception, having been referred through Davis's professional connection to his parents.
