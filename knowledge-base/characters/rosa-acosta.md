??? warning "Background"

    Rosa Acosta is a fifteen-year-old metahuman who operates under the codename Bubble as the defensive specialist of the Tacony Titans, a team of young vigilante heroes based in the Tacony neighborhood of Northeast Philadelphia. She is distinguished by her pink-dyed hair and her ability to generate protective force fields of varying sizes. The circumstances of her power activation are not documented, but by the time the Auditors first encountered the Tacony Titans in late April 2024, Rosa was already an established member of the team operating alongside Sundial, Compass, Moonshot, and Sandman.

    Rosa comes from what is described as a stable, middle-class household with loving but permissive parents who support her superhero activities. This stands in marked contrast to many of her peers in the Philadelphia vigilante community, whose families either oppose or are unaware of their costumed lives. Her parents' acceptance has allowed Rosa to participate openly in the Titans' operations without the familial friction that characterizes teammates on other squads.

    The Tacony Titans were first mentioned as a local superhero team early in the story's timeline, when Sam Small's friend Lilly referenced them as a group her father had encountered. The team later became a significant part of the broader vigilante coalition in Philadelphia, with Rosa serving as one of its most recognizable members due to her distinctive abilities and personality.

??? note "Powers & Abilities"

    **PERKS Assessment**

    No official PERKS assessment on file.

    **Abilities**

    - **Force Field Generation (Bubbles)** - Creates protective force fields of varying sizes, described as rainbow-colored translucent constructs. These "bubbles" can be deployed around people, objects, or areas to serve as defensive barriers against physical threats, projectiles, and environmental hazards.
    - **Selective Impermeability** - Her bubbles can be made selectively impermeable to air, allowing Rosa to suffocate or trap targets within an enclosed field while still permitting other matter through, or conversely to create sealed environments that protect occupants from toxic gases or atmospheric threats.
    - **Trapping and Transport** - Can encase individuals or objects within bubbles to immobilize them or carry them from one location to another, functioning as both a restraint mechanism and a means of protected conveyance.
    - **Shielding** - Deploys force fields as stationary or mobile shields to protect allies during combat, covering downed teammates and providing cover against armed attackers.

    **Limitations**

    - Specific upper limits of bubble durability, size range, and the maximum number of simultaneous fields Rosa can maintain are not documented.
    - Rosa is a baseline human outside of her force field abilities; she lacks enhanced durability, regeneration, or physical augmentations.
    - At age fifteen, she is the youngest member of the Tacony Titans and one of the youngest active vigilantes in the Philadelphia hero community, with comparatively limited combat experience.
    - Her force fields appear to require active concentration, meaning she must choose between offensive and defensive deployments in rapidly changing situations.

    **Training & Skills**

    - Trained in team-based combat tactics through her work with the Tacony Titans, operating under Sundial's strategic leadership.
    - Experienced in coordinated operations involving multiple vigilante teams, having participated in joint missions with the Auditors and Team Mayfly.
    - Skilled in defensive positioning and ally protection, consistently deployed as the team's shield and extraction specialist during combat scenarios.

??? warning "Personality"

    Rosa is bubbly, compassionate, and idealistic, embodying the optimism that her codename suggests. She serves as the emotional core of the Tacony Titans, bringing warmth and positivity to a team composed of more pragmatic and reserved personalities. She is always looking for ways to help others and consistently pushes for peaceful resolutions to conflicts when possible. Her teammates rely on her not only for defensive support in the field but for the morale and cohesion she brings to the group dynamic.

    Despite her youth, Rosa demonstrates genuine courage under fire. During the Dobson Mills warehouse battle, she attempted to shield the injured Sundial from attackers and, after being ordered to flee, returned from a catwalk to assist the combined hero teams. She has expressed strong opinions about threats in her community, including a notable dislike of the independent vigilante initially known as "the mosquito" (later revealed to be Miss Mayfly). Her role as the team's moral compass means she advocates for the ethical course of action even when more expedient alternatives are available.

??? warning "Relationships"

    | Character | Relationship | Notes |
    |-----------|-------------|-------|
    | Lucy King (Sundial) | Team Leader | Sundial leads the Tacony Titans and directs Rosa in the field. Rosa follows Sundial's tactical commands, including orders to retreat during dangerous situations. |
    | Joshua Clark (Sandman) | Teammate | Second-in-command of the Titans. Rosa operates alongside Sandman in team deployments and joint operations. |

    | Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Ally | Leader of the Auditors. Sam's team operates as the aggressive counterpart to the Titans' defensive approach. During the Dobson Mills battle, Sam helped defend Rosa and Sundial, and ordered Rosa to safety. |
    | Jordan Westwood (Safeguard) | Ally | Auditor member. Participated in joint operations alongside Rosa during the Dobson Mills warehouse confrontation. |

??? warning "Trivia"

    - Rosa's codename "Bubble" and her described personality as "bubbly" form a deliberate thematic pairing between her powers and her temperament.
    - She is the youngest member of the Tacony Titans, with the next youngest being Sandman at eighteen.
    - The Tacony Titans are described in the character reference guide as "the boy scouts of Tacony" and the "defensive, reactive" counterpart to the Auditors' "aggressive, proactive" approach - a dynamic Rosa's shield-oriented powers embody perfectly.
    - An early roster of the Tacony Titans listed in Chapter 17 included a member called "Weave" who does not appear in the team's later composition, suggesting a roster change between the team's early days and their on-page introduction.
    - Rosa's force fields are described as rainbow-colored during her first appearance at Wissinoming Park.
    - Her arrest by police during an anti-vigilante crackdown in Arc 12 became a catalyst for strategic discussions among the Titans about whether to go underground or stand down entirely.
