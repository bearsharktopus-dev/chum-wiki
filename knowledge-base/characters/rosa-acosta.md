## Background

Rosa Acosta is a fifteen-year-old metahuman who operates under the codename Bubble as the defensive specialist of the Tacony Titans, a team of young vigilante heroes based in the Tacony neighborhood of Northeast Philadelphia. She is distinguished by her brown curls (sometimes with pink dye) and her ability to generate rainbow-colored bubble force fields of varying sizes. By the time the Auditors first encountered the Titans in late April 2024, Rosa was already an established member operating alongside Sundial, Compass, Moonshot, and Sandman.

Rosa comes from a stable, middle-class household with loving but permissive parents who support her superhero activities - a marked contrast to many peers in the Philadelphia vigilante community whose families either oppose or are unaware of their costumed lives.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Force Field Generation (Bubbles)** - Creates rainbow-colored protective bubble force fields of varying sizes, projected from rainbow-colored gloves. These "bubbles" can be deployed around people, objects, or areas to serve as defensive barriers against physical threats, projectiles, and environmental hazards.
- **Selective Impermeability** - Her bubbles can be made selectively impermeable to air, allowing Rosa to suffocate or trap targets within an enclosed field while still permitting other matter through, or conversely to create sealed environments that protect occupants from toxic gases or atmospheric threats.
- **Trapping and Transport** - Can encase individuals or objects within bubbles to immobilize them or carry them from one location to another, functioning as both a restraint mechanism and a means of protected conveyance.
- **Shielding** - Deploys force fields as stationary or mobile shields to protect allies during combat, covering downed teammates and providing cover against armed attackers.

### Limitations

- Upper limits of bubble durability, size range, and maximum simultaneous fields are not documented.
- Baseline human outside her force field abilities.
- Force fields appear to require active concentration, forcing choices between offensive and defensive deployments.

### Training & Skills

- Trained in team-based tactics under Sundial's leadership; experienced in multi-team joint operations with the Auditors and Team Mayfly.
- Consistently deployed as the Titans' shield and extraction specialist.

## Personality

Rosa is bubbly, compassionate, and idealistic, serving as the emotional core of the Tacony Titans. She brings warmth and positivity to a team of more pragmatic personalities, consistently pushing for peaceful resolutions and advocating for the ethical course of action. Her teammates rely on her for morale and cohesion as much as for defensive support.

Despite her youth, Rosa demonstrates genuine courage under fire - notably staying by Sundial's side during the Dobson Mills battle (Arc 5) when ordered to flee, then returning for one last crucial intervention. She has expressed strong opinions about community threats, including a notable dislike of the vigilante initially known as "the mosquito" (later Miss Mayfly).

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Rosa first appears on-page in Chapter 70, intervening with Sundial in a drunken dispute at Wissinoming Park. Sam and Jordan encounter her creating iridescent force-field bubbles from rainbow gloves and wearing a bandana-mask. She is formally introduced as a member of the Tacony Titans and displays her chipper, enthusiastic personality. Rosa mentions a pest called "the mosquito," before Sundial chides her for gossiping. In Chapter 73, the Titans assist during the battle with Ricochet. In Chapter 80, the Auditors and Titans hold a joint planning meeting at the Titans' garage headquarters, where Rosa introduces herself and her force field abilities are catalogued for the combined operation against Squeal. She and Compass are assigned to containment duty. During the Dobson Mills warehouse battle in Chapter 81, Rosa creates force field bubbles around an enemy's head to trap him with smoke and stink bomb fumes, then stacks additional bubbles around his wrists and fingers to prevent removal - showing creative offensive applications of her defensive power. After becoming exhausted, Sundial orders her to leave, but Rosa returns from the upper catwalks to provide one final crucial save - wrapping bubbles around a gunman's head and hands to prevent him from loading his weapon, buying Sam the seconds needed to save Jordan's life. In Chapter 83, Bubble is sent as the Titans' representative to the three-team meeting at the Tacony Music Hall. In Chapter 85, Bubble reports on the Titans' investigation findings during a combined meeting of the DVD, Young Defenders, and Tacony Titans to discuss the Rogue Wave threat, relaying that Sundial's postcognition revealed the drugs are being transported into the city by land.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Supporting

    During Maya Richardson's manufactured blizzard, all Tacony Titans members are overwhelmed with storm response - search and rescue operations throughout the night including car accidents, people without power, and medical emergencies. In Chapter 229, Sundial contacts the Auditors requesting intelligence support and coordination, setting up a shared communication channel between the two teams. Bubble and Compass are assigned to residential check-ins while Moonshot sweeps the Cottman corridor and Sandman coordinates from base. The Titans are stretched thin dealing with the storm's aftermath and the fifteen coordinated Kingdom break-ins it concealed.


## Trivia

- Her codename "Bubble" and her "bubbly" personality form a deliberate thematic pairing.
- Youngest Titan at fifteen; the next youngest is Sandman at eighteen.
- The Titans are "the boy scouts of Tacony" - the "defensive, reactive" counterpart to the Auditors' "aggressive, proactive" approach, a dynamic Rosa's shield-oriented powers embody perfectly.
- An early roster listed in Chapter 17 included a member called "Weave" who does not appear in later compositions, suggesting a roster change.
- Her Arc 12 arrest became a catalyst for discussions among the Titans about whether to go underground or stand down.
