## Background

Daisy Zhen was kidnapped at approximately age eight from Los Angeles by agents of Project Hollywood, a clandestine program that mass-abducted marginalized children to condition them into metahuman weapons. She was lured into a black car by strangers who claimed her parents had sent them, then transported to a facility with gray buildings, barbed wire fences, and locked doors. A woman in a white coat informed Daisy this was her "new home" and that training would begin soon. Over the following years, she was subjected to mysterious "treatments" where she was put to sleep and woke with new injuries and unexplained bandages. She heard screams from other children at night and learned to stay quiet and compliant after being punished for crying. Her only comfort object was a stuffed penguin named Mr. Waddles, given to her at the facility. Her parents, Wei and Xiuying Zhen, were never able to find her.

During a "final test" involving a bald man with telekinetic abilities, Daisy's own powers manifested violently under intense mental pressure, and she threw the man through a door with copied telekinesis, possibly killing him. Rather than being punished, she was rewarded and put through regular power testing, moving objects with her mind, and "desensitization training" involving violent images and simulated weapon scenarios.

At approximately age twelve, Daisy was transported to Philadelphia in a shipping container and delivered to Amira Irshad (Patches), the leader of the Philly Phreaks, by a handler known as Mrs. Z. Spinelli later confirmed that the Kingdom of Keys had "gifted" Daisy to the Phreaks as a weapon. Patches gave Daisy a basement room with a soft mattress and stuffed penguins. Daisy experienced nightmares that triggered her gravity nullification power, and Patches comforted her by reading manga featuring a girl who joins a Demon Lord. Daisy identified with the character who chose power and independence, and adopted the persona of "Deathgirl." Patches served as a surrogate parental figure, but Daisy remained deeply emotionally damaged from her years of abuse.

Daisy participated in the Phreaks' confrontation with the Young Defenders on South Street, where she demonstrated her power-copying abilities by cycling through multiple teammates' powers. She later took part in the kidnapping and torture of Sam Small alongside Aaron McKinley and the other Phreaks. During the Chernobyl trial, the Phreaks launched a terrorist attack on the Philadelphia courthouse, where Daisy fought Sam in a brutal one-on-one battle on the courthouse steps. Sam ultimately subdued her, and Daisy was remanded to Daedalus Correctional Facility in solitary confinement.

In September 2025, a joint Kingdom of Keys and Red Calf operation breached Daedalus to extract Daisy on Porcelain's orders. She woke prematurely during the extraction, copied the operatives' powers, and escaped on her own. Daisy fell through a liquefied tunnel floor into an older mining level beneath Daedalus, deliberately maintaining anger at Mudslide to keep his liquefaction powers active. She discovered she could liquefy stone with a single touch rather than needing both hands, an advancement beyond her previously known capability, and used a mental mantra about Mr. Waddles to maintain her emotional connection to Mudslide's powers.

After encountering a group of escaped prisoners who recognized her as "Deathgirl, the copier" from the isolation wing, Daisy formed a tactical alliance with Cold-Cut (who had freezing abilities) and Switchback (gravity manipulation). As rising floodwaters created urgency, the group navigated mine tunnels with Cold-Cut creating ice bridges to seal leaks. At Junction 12, Daisy used liquefaction powers to carve a spiral ramp up a ventilation shaft, and Flux (a prisoner with metal manipulation) removed grates blocking their exit. On the surface, Switchback provided money and advice before departing toward the Canadian border, while Cold-Cut unexpectedly agreed to accompany Daisy south. They acquired civilian clothes and adopted false identities as aunt and niece, boarding a bus to Albany. Cold-Cut departed at Albany for Saratoga.

Alone in Albany, Daisy used payphones and the public library to search for her parents, leveraging her limited Cantonese to connect with the local Chinese-American community and track down their address on Western Avenue. She had been awake for approximately four days by the time she arrived at their apartment. Her father Wei immediately activated an "emergency protocol," revealing that her parents had been planning for her potential return for three months with legal representation already in place. Federal marshals arrived almost immediately, but family attorney Patricia Gilly intervened and established Daisy's rights as a minor.

A compromise medical evaluation at Albany Medical Center by Dr. Michaels confirmed exhaustion, mild dehydration, and post-traumatic stress. During an emergency court hearing, DOJ attorney Jennifer Ross argued for federal custody, but Judge Esposito denied the government's request and ordered temporary placement at the Whitford Institute in Chicago, the country's only specialized psychiatric facility for powered youth. The judge mandated full parental access, weekly medical reports, and comprehensive review in 30 days. Dr. Olivia Reed from Whitford coordinated the transfer. Wei promised to relocate the family to Chicago. During the flight, Daisy produced Mr. Waddles from her belongings, showing rare vulnerability. Porcelain (Chezki Espinosa), the man with a braided beard and sunglasses, was observed watching the courthouse proceedings, confirming continued Red Calf interest in Daisy.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | A9/SO/PEM/P |
| **Category** | Adjust |
| **Power Ranking** | 9/10 |
| **Control** | 1/10 |
| **Hostility** | 10/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 10/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 10/10 |

### Abilities

- **Anger-Induced Dynamimesis** - Automatically and autonomously copies and enhances the superpowers of the individual Daisy is currently most angry at. The copied power is estimated to be 20–30% stronger than the original and often manifests without the original power's weaknesses.
- **Physical Mutation Manifestation** - Copied powers manifest as physical mutations on her body, including additional appendages, bone spikes, chitinous skin, insect wings, and other alterations depending on the source power.
- **Rapid Power Shifting** - Can shift between copied powers by redirecting her anger toward a different individual. This shifting can occur multiple times in quick succession, making her highly unpredictable in combat.
- **Emotional Power Direction** - Demonstrated the ability to consciously maintain or redirect anger to control which power she copies. During the Daedalus escape, she deliberately maintained anger at Mudslide to keep his liquefaction powers active by repeating a mental mantra, and could consciously "chase" specific individuals by making herself angry at them to recall their powers without needing proximity. She can also switch between copied powers by redirecting her emotional focus to a different target.
- **No Proximity Requirement** - Does not require physical proximity to the target whose power she copies. The ability is classified as "Postmile" range.
- **Power Enhancement** - Copied powers sometimes manifest with reduced limitations. During the Daedalus escape, Daisy's copied liquefaction worked with a single touch rather than the original user's two-handed requirement, though effectiveness varied by material (less effective on soil than stone).

### Limitations

- **Emotional Dependency** - Power is entirely dependent on anger. If her anger subsides or is redirected, the copied and enhanced powers may diminish or disappear.
- **Physical Strain** - Rapid shifting and physical mutations place significant strain on her body. Long-term effects are unknown but potentially severe.
- **Lack of Control** - Power activates and shifts autonomously based on anger, increasing the risk of unintended consequences and collateral damage. Her control rating is assessed at 1/10.
- **Exhaustion** - As a young teenager of otherwise normal endurance, Daisy is prone to fits of exhaustion and overexertion that cause her to lose consciousness, deactivating her powers.
- **Singular Copying** - Can only copy a single power at a time.

### Training & Skills

- Conditioned in combat and violence through Project Hollywood's desensitization training program, including exposure to violent imagery and simulated weapon scenarios.
- Demonstrated tactical intelligence and survival skills during her escape from Daedalus, including navigating underground tunnel systems, forming strategic alliances, and using public resources to locate her parents.
- Limited Cantonese language ability, sufficient to communicate with members of the Chinese-American community.

## Personality

Daisy masks intense misanthropy and self-loathing beneath a layer of bravado, rage, and violent posturing. She styled herself as a "Demon King" and displayed extreme hostility and willingness to cause harm during her time with the Phreaks, including eagerly participating in the torture of Sam Small. Underneath the aggression lies deep fear, emotional immaturity, and the psychological scars of years of abuse beginning in early childhood. She is prone to tantrums and emotional outbursts, and her lack of emotional regulation directly feeds her uncontrollable powers.

Despite her conditioning, Daisy has shown glimpses of vulnerability and capacity for growth. She kept a stuffed penguin named Mr. Waddles throughout her imprisonment and carried it with her during her escape, producing it during the medical transport flight to Chicago in a moment of rare openness. During her final confrontation with Sam on the courthouse steps, she broke down sobbing and apologizing incoherently as her strength gave out. Her behavior during the Daedalus escape demonstrated remarkable resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and a desperate desire to reunite with her parents: she proposed a "tactical alliance" with Cold-Cut based on complementary powers, navigated mine tunnels under rising floodwater, used public resources systematically to find her parents in an unfamiliar city, and leveraged her limited Cantonese to connect with a community that could help her. The personal items in her Daedalus cell (Mr. Waddles, educational books, photos) indicated that rehabilitation efforts were having a positive effect before the prison break interrupted her progress. Her methodical approach to finding her parents despite having been awake for four consecutive days demonstrates remarkable determination and self-sufficiency for a fourteen-year-old.
