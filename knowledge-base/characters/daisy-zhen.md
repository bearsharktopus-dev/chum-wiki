## Background

Daisy Zhen was kidnapped at approximately age eight from Los Angeles by agents of Project Hollywood, a clandestine program that mass-abducted marginalized children to condition them into metahuman weapons. Over the following years, she was subjected to "treatments" that deliberately damaged her amygdala and prefrontal cortex with psychoactive substances to create "perpetual emotional dysregulation" - turning her into a weapon that could be "set and forget." Her powers manifested during a "final test" when she threw a telekinetic handler through a door with his own copied power. Her only comfort object from this period was a stuffed penguin named Mr. Waddles.

At approximately age twelve, Daisy was shipped to Philadelphia and delivered to Patches (Amira Irshad) of the Philly Phreaks by Mrs. Zenith, a Kingdom of Keys handler. Patches served as a surrogate parent - giving Daisy a room with stuffed penguins, reading her manga, and comforting her through nightmares - but also deployed her as a weapon. Daisy adopted the "Deathgirl" persona after identifying with a manga character who chose power and independence.

Daisy fought the Young Defenders on South Street (Book 3), participated in Sam Small's kidnapping and torture (Book 4), and led the Phreaks' terrorist attack on the Philadelphia courthouse during the Chernobyl trial (Book 6), where Sam subdued her. She was remanded to Daedalus Correctional Facility. In September 2025, a joint Kingdom/Red Calf extraction operation breached Daedalus to retrieve her, but she woke prematurely, copied the operatives' powers, and escaped on her own into the mine tunnels beneath the facility (Book 13). After allying with fellow escapees and traveling to Albany, she located her parents using payphones, the public library, and the local Chinese-American community. A court hearing placed her at the Whitford Institute in Chicago for psychiatric rehabilitation, where she currently resides.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | A9/SO/PEM/P |
| **Category** | Adjust |
| **Power Ranking** | 9/10 |
| **Control** | 1/10 |
| **Hostility** | 10/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 10/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 10/10 |

### Abilities

- **Anger-Induced Dynamimesis** - Automatically and autonomously copies and enhances the superpowers of the individual Daisy is currently most angry at. The copied power is estimated to be 20-30% stronger than the original and often manifests without the original power's weaknesses.
- **Physical Mutation Manifestation** - Copied powers manifest as physical mutations on her body, including additional appendages, bone spikes, chitinous skin, insect wings, and other alterations depending on the source power.
- **Rapid Power Shifting** - Can shift between copied powers by redirecting her anger toward a different individual. This shifting can occur multiple times in quick succession, making her highly unpredictable in combat.
- **Emotional Power Direction** - Can consciously maintain or redirect anger to control which power she copies, including "chasing" specific individuals by making herself angry at them to recall their powers. Used a mental mantra to sustain Mudslide's liquefaction during the Daedalus escape.
- **No Proximity Requirement** - Does not require physical proximity to the target whose power she copies. The ability is classified as "Postmile" range.
- **Power Enhancement** - Copied powers sometimes manifest with reduced limitations (e.g., single-touch liquefaction vs. Mudslide's two-handed requirement), though effectiveness may vary by context.

### Limitations

- **Emotional Dependency** - Power is entirely dependent on anger. If her anger subsides or is redirected, the copied and enhanced powers may diminish or disappear.
- **Physical Strain** - Rapid shifting and physical mutations place significant strain on her body. Long-term effects are unknown but potentially severe.
- **Lack of Control** - Power activates and shifts autonomously based on anger, increasing the risk of unintended consequences and collateral damage. Her control rating is assessed at 1/10.
- **Exhaustion** - As a young teenager of otherwise normal endurance, Daisy is prone to fits of exhaustion and overexertion that cause her to lose consciousness, deactivating her powers.
- **Singular Copying** - Can only copy a single power at a time.

### Other Skills

- Combat conditioning and desensitization training from Project Hollywood.
- Demonstrated tactical intelligence and survival resourcefulness during her Daedalus escape.
- Limited Cantonese, sufficient for basic communication.

## Personality

Daisy masks intense fear and self-loathing beneath bravado, rage, and violent posturing - styling herself a "Demon Lord" and displaying extreme hostility during her time with the Phreaks. Underneath the aggression lies deep emotional immaturity and the psychological scars of years of abuse. Her lack of emotional regulation directly feeds her uncontrollable powers.

Despite her conditioning, Daisy has shown genuine vulnerability and capacity for growth. She has kept Mr. Waddles throughout every stage of her life since Project Hollywood. Her breakdown on the courthouse steps (Book 6) and her determined, resourceful journey to find her parents after the Daedalus escape (Book 13) both reveal a child fighting to reclaim something normal. Personal items in her Daedalus cell indicated rehabilitation was having a positive effect before the prison break interrupted it.

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Listed in the character tags for Interlude MR.4 (Maya Richardson POV), in which Porcelain discusses his interest in Daisy as an asset with Mrs. Zenith, referring to her as "a demonstration, a weapon" and pushing for her extraction from Daedalus.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Supporting (Interlude)

    In Interlude WXZ.1 (Wei and Xiuying Zhen POV), Daisy's parents are contacted by NSRA Agent Kaplan and flown to Daedalus to visit their daughter for the first time since her kidnapping five years prior. Daisy is described as having choppy, uneven hair and a hardness in her eyes. She refers to herself as "Deathgirl" and was told her parents were dead or had given her away. Despite her hostility, she remembers fragments of her earlier life - seashells at Santa Monica, cooking dumplings, a scratchy ballet tutu, and her grandmother's jade butterfly necklace. She demonstrates a grounding technique (5-4-3-2-1 senses) during an anger flash, indicating therapeutic progress. Brain scans show new neural connections forming due to adolescent neuroplasticity. Dr. Ethan Novak explains that Project Hollywood deliberately damaged her brain (amygdala and prefrontal cortex) with psychoactive substances to create "perpetual emotional dysregulation." Her parents begin planning to move to Albany to be near Daedalus.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Main (Interlude)

    Target of a joint Kingdom of Keys and Red Calf extraction operation at Daedalus on September 10th, orchestrated by Porcelain to coincide with state senate hearings and Boston protests as cover. The extraction team (Mudslide, Vector, Tarbaby, Mrs. Synapse) reaches her cell (Cell 17, Block D-7), but Daisy wakes prematurely from sedation because she is better nourished than expected - her cell contains personal items (Mr. Waddles, books, photos) indicating rehabilitation was having a positive effect. She copies Vector's telekinesis, Mrs. Synapse's nerve manipulation, and Mudslide's liquefaction in rapid succession without physical contact, dissolves the tunnel floor, and escapes into older mining levels beneath the facility. In Interlude DZ.2, Daisy falls through the liquefied floor and deliberately maintains anger at Mudslide to keep his powers active, discovering she can liquefy stone with a single touch rather than needing both hands. She encounters other escapees who recognize her as "Deathgirl, the copier" from the isolation wing, and forms a tactical alliance with Switchback (gravity manipulation) and Cold-Cut (freezing abilities). The group navigates flooded mine tunnels - Cold-Cut creates ice bridges to seal leaks, Daisy carves a spiral ramp up a ventilation shaft using liquefaction, and Flux (metal manipulation) removes grates blocking their exit. On the surface, Switchback provides money and departs toward the Canadian border; Cold-Cut accompanies Daisy south, posing as aunt and niece on a bus to Albany. Cold-Cut departs at Saratoga. Alone in Albany, Daisy uses payphones, the public library, and the Chinese-American Cultural Association to locate her parents on Western Avenue using her limited Cantonese, having been awake for approximately four days. In Interlude DZ.3, her father Wei activates a pre-arranged "emergency protocol" with attorney Patricia Gilly already retained. Federal Marshals arrive but Gilly establishes Daisy's minor rights. A medical evaluation by Dr. Michaels at Albany Medical Center confirms exhaustion, dehydration, and PTSD; Dr. Michaels references "The First Place" (implied to be Project Hollywood). At an emergency hearing before Judge Esposito, DOJ attorney Jennifer Ross demands federal custody, but the judge orders temporary placement at the Whitford Institute in Chicago with full parental access, weekly reports, and 30-day review. Dr. Olivia Reed from Whitford coordinates the transfer. Wei and Xiuying pledge to relocate to Chicago. During the medical flight, Daisy produces Mr. Waddles from her belongings. Porcelain (braided beard, sunglasses) is observed watching the courthouse proceedings, confirming Red Calf's continued interest.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in passing when Sam and Amelia compare the danger of fighting Patriot to previous encounters, with Sam noting that the Deathgirl fight was scarier (Ch. 232). Also referenced by Sam when discussing the Phreaks' courthouse attack and its consequences (Ch. 220).

??? warning "Intermission 15.5: This Side Up"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Referenced in Interlude TF.2 (Trent Fairfax POV). Fairfax visits the recovery ward at Jefferson Hospital where victims of the courthouse attack are still being treated, reflecting on the chain of responsibility: "Maya brought Deathgirl into the fold. Maya operates under me." Confirms the Kingdom hierarchy of Antithesis to Mrs. Zenith to Deathgirl to Phreaks. Marcus Whitmore, a courthouse victim, asks Fairfax about Deathgirl going missing from Daedalus and the Phreaks being transferred.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Mentioned

    Invoked by Songbird protesters confronting Sam, who argue against metahumans by citing Deathgirl: "Like Deathgirl was a child? The one you let walk away from that courthouse? How many people died because you didn't put her down when you had the chance?" (Ch. 233).


## Trivia

- Mudslide insisted on taking Daisy's personal belongings during the extraction to keep her calm.
- Her PERKS assessment was conducted by Officer Michael Johnson in August 2024, with a supplemental power assessment by Dr. Emily Nakamura in September 2024.
- Patches manipulated Daisy into fighting by telling her that Playback worked for "bad people" who made her parents leave.
- Chernobyl was kept out of the courthouse battle because Crossroads warned Deathgirl could copy his nuclear powers and become a walking meltdown.
- The prison break was not yet public knowledge at the time of Daisy's court hearing, with only seven high-risk escapees reported in the press (the "Magnificent Seven").
- She appears positioned for a potential heel-antihero turn.
