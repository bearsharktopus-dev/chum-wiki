## Background

Zero is a metahuman with the ability to negate other metahumans' powers at range, operating as a member of Pattinson's Pals under the leadership of Patriot (Richard Johnson) and Egalitarian (Natalie). Almost nothing is known about Zero's personal identity, history, or the origin of his abilities.

Zero first appeared during a confrontation with Sam Small and Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) in Tacony during a training session in September 2024. He and a group of Pattinson's Pals followers stalked and chased Sam and Maggie through the streets after negating their powers from a distance, forcing the pair to flee on foot until they escaped his effective range. Zero later appeared flanking Patriot at the homecoming confrontation at Tacony Charter Academy and at a subsequent rally at Dilworth Park.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Area-of-Effect Power Negation** -- Suppresses metahuman abilities within a radius around himself without requiring physical contact. Both Sam's enhanced senses and Maggie's force fields ceased functioning while within his range. This is notably distinct from Mr. Nothing's power negation, which requires direct physical touch.

### Limitations

- His effective range has finite limits; Sam and Maggie's powers returned once they put sufficient distance between themselves and Zero during the Tacony chase.
- Specific upper limits of his range, whether his negation is selective or indiscriminate, and whether it affects all power types equally are not documented.
- During the chase, Sam noted that her old Deathgirl wound resurfaced without her regeneration active in Zero's field, suggesting his negation affects passive and autonomous powers as well as active ones.

### Training & Skills

- No documented training or non-power skills.

## Personality

Zero's personality is largely unknown. He operates as a loyal follower within Pattinson's Pals, appearing at rallies and confrontations alongside Patriot. His willingness to chase two teenagers through the streets of Tacony with a group of followers suggests an aggressive enforcement mentality consistent with the Pals' vigilante ideology.

## Relationships

| Richard Johnson (Patriot) | Leader | Flanks Patriot at rallies and public events. Operates under Patriot's direction as part of Pattinson's Pals. |
| Natalie (Egalitarian) | Teammate | Fellow Pattinson's Pals member. Both possess powers that counter metahumans in different ways -- Zero negates powers directly while Egalitarian's vertigo affects only non-powered individuals. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary | Chased Sam through the streets of Tacony after negating her powers. Appeared at subsequent confrontations. |
| Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) | Adversary | Negated Maggie's force fields during the Tacony training session confrontation. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Confronts Sam and Maggie during a training session in an abandoned Tacony lot (Ch. 109), negating their powers at range and forcing them to flee through the streets of Tacony with his followers in pursuit.

## Trivia

- Zero's power negation at range is explicitly contrasted with Mr. Nothing's contact-based power negation, making Zero a qualitatively different and arguably more dangerous threat in the story's power landscape.
- His appearance is described as distinctive: a fedora, trench coat, and domino mask with baby-blue eyes visible above it.
- Sam's old Deathgirl wound resurfacing in Zero's field demonstrates that his negation strips even passive regenerative effects, not just actively deployed powers.
- His full capabilities, identity, origin, and connection to any broader organization beyond Pattinson's Pals remain entirely unexplored as of Book 16.
- The plot thread tracker classifies Zero's power negation as an OPEN thread (Thread 19, Books 6-7), noting that power negation is "extremely rare and dangerous in this setting" and that his area-of-effect version is "far more threatening" than Mr. Nothing's touch-based variant.
