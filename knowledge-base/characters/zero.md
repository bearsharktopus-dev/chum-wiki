## Background

Citizen Zero is a metahuman member of Pattinson's Pals with the ability to negate other metahumans' powers at range. Almost nothing is known about his personal identity, history, or the origin of his abilities. He operates as part of Patriot's core team, appearing across Book 7 in confrontations, rallies, and private meetings.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Area-of-Effect Power Negation** - Suppresses metahuman abilities within a radius around himself without requiring physical contact. Sam's regeneration and tooth projection ceased functioning and Maggie's repulsive fields stopped working while within his range. This is notably distinct from Mr. Nothing's power negation, which requires direct physical touch.

### Limitations

- His effective range has finite limits; Sam and Maggie's powers returned once they put sufficient distance between themselves and Zero during the Tacony chase.
- Specific upper limits of his range, whether his negation is selective or indiscriminate, and whether it affects all power types equally are not documented.
- When Zero's power first took effect, Sam's old Deathgirl wound resurfaced without her regeneration active, suggesting his negation affects passive and autonomous powers as well as active ones.

## Personality

Zero projects a predatory, unhurried confidence. During the Tacony chase (Ch. 109-110), he stood under a streetlight with his hands in his pockets while his followers did the running, content to let his targets tire themselves out. At a private warehouse meeting (Ch. 111), he dismissed Bloodhound contemptuously, suggesting "a little more pressure" would deal with her.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Richard Johnson (Patriot) | Leader | Operates as part of Patriot's core team within Pattinson's Pals. |
| Natalie (Egalitarian) | Teammate | Their powers are complementary inverses - Zero negates metahuman powers, while Egalitarian's vertigo affects only non-powered individuals. |
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Adversary | Negated Sam's powers and chased her through Tacony (Ch. 109-110). |
| Maggie O'Brien (Flashpoint) | Adversary | Negated Maggie's force fields during the same Tacony confrontation. |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Confronts Sam and Maggie during a training session in an abandoned Tacony lot (Ch. 109), negating their powers at range and forcing them to flee through the streets of Tacony with his followers in pursuit. Zero himself barely chases, standing under a streetlight with his hands in his pockets while his followers try to cut the pair off. Sam and Maggie escape once they exit his range and reach the Tacony Music Hall (Ch. 110). Sam later overhears Zero at a warehouse meeting with Patriot and Egalitarian, where he dismisses Bloodhound and suggests applying more pressure (Ch. 111). During the Auditors' investigation, the team compiles surveillance photos including shots of Zero buying drugs or weapons. Appears on stage flanking Patriot at the Dilworth Park protest/counterprotest rally, carrying twin batons holstered at his hips (Ch. 117). Patriot names Zero as one of his core team members during a midnight meeting with Bloodhound (Ch. 118).


## Trivia

- His appearance is distinctive: a fedora, trench coat, and domino mask with baby-blue eyes visible above it. Also carries twin batons holstered at his hips.
- His full capabilities, identity, origin, and connection to any broader organization beyond Pattinson's Pals remain entirely unexplored as of Book 16.
- The plot thread tracker classifies his power negation as an OPEN thread (Thread 19, Books 6-7), noting that AoE power negation is "extremely rare and dangerous in this setting" and "far more threatening" than Mr. Nothing's touch-based variant.
