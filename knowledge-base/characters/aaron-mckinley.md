## Background

Aaron McKinley was the leader of the Tacony Coyotes, a local teen gang operating out of the area beneath the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge in Northeast Philadelphia. He was physically distinctive, described as pale-skinned with tattoos, cornrows, and wind chime earrings. His gang engaged in vandalism, drug dealing, and petty theft throughout the Tacony and Mayfair neighborhoods. Aaron possessed fire-ignition powers activated by his gaze, making him the only metahuman in the group and the source of his authority over the other members.

Aaron's criminal trajectory escalated dramatically after his first encounter with Sam Small and Jordan Westwood in September 2023, when the two young vigilantes confronted the Coyotes beneath the bridge. The fight ended with Sam biting into Aaron's shoulder and breaking his collarbone. Humiliated and injured, Aaron was subsequently summoned by the Kingdom of Keys, for whom the Coyotes had been running low-level operations. Faced with the threat of severe punishment for losing the Kingdom's money, Aaron was given an assignment: kill Bloodhound. He formed a temporary alliance with members of the Philly Phreaks, including Pumice and Deathgirl, and identified Sam's civilian identity by surveilling Tacony Charter Academy.

After his coordinated ambush on Sam resulted in her capture and torture - during which he removed her fingernails and broke her hand - Sam escaped by growing teeth from her wrists and knuckles, puncturing Aaron's throat and tearing eight jagged lines across his face. His subsequent alliance with the Phreaks collapsed when Chrysalis, Pumice, and Deathgirl confronted him at the docks. Pumice showed Aaron the damage Sam had inflicted on his stone face during her escape, and Chrysalis delivered a devastating character assessment before telling him he was "not worth the bullet." Aaron retreated from Philadelphia with injuries including a dislocated knee (reset by the vet with a splint) and a re-broken nose, spending time in Bucks County and surrounding areas while his fire powers evolved. He returned months later to conduct a calculated arson and stalking campaign across Tacony in February 2025, which ended with his arrest following a final confrontation with Sam at an abandoned house near Vogt Park. He was sentenced to 38 years at Daedalus Correctional Facility.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Fire Ignition (Gaze-Based)** - Aaron's original power allows him to ignite flammable materials and generate fire through his gaze. Initial manifestation produced standard yellow-orange flames capable of setting objects and people on fire, weakening metal supports, and creating area denial.
- **Fire Color Spectrum (Evolved)** - Over time, Aaron developed the ability to produce multiple types of fire with distinct properties. Yellow flames represent his baseline ability. Red flames are hotter and more focused. Blue flames produce toxic fumes. White flames represent his most advanced and volatile manifestation, sometimes appearing unexpectedly even to Aaron himself.
- **Smoke Generation** - Aaron can produce thick smoke to obscure vision, create smokescreens for escape, and fill enclosed spaces. This ability became more pronounced as his powers evolved.
- **Fire Immunity** - Aaron is unharmed by his own flames, as demonstrated when Jordan threw a burning cloak onto him during their initial fight and he remained unaffected.
- **Toxic Fume Tolerance** - Through deliberate exposure to his own blue fire's toxic byproducts, Aaron built a tolerance to the fumes that would incapacitate others.

### Limitations

- **Gaze Dependency** - Aaron's fire-ignition power requires his gaze, making it vulnerable to visual obstruction. Sam neutralized this during their first fight by spitting blood into his eyes.
- **Respiratory Damage** - Prolonged exposure to his own blue fire's toxic fumes caused significant deterioration of Aaron's lungs, noted by the veterinarian who treated him.
- **Inconsistent Control** - Aaron's evolved fire abilities, particularly white fire, sometimes manifested unpredictably, suggesting incomplete mastery over his more advanced powers.
- **Physical Limitations** - Despite his metahuman fire abilities, Aaron possesses no enhanced durability or healing. He sustained severe injuries across multiple fights, requiring treatment from a criminal-affiliated veterinarian.

### Training & Skills

- Street fighting experience as a gang leader, though lacking formal combat training.
- Proficiency in psychological warfare and intimidation tactics, including orchestrating indirect threatening messages through chains of unwitting intermediaries.
- Surveillance and stalking skills, demonstrated by his methodical tracking of Sam's movements around her school, home, and known locations.
- Knowledge of accelerant placement and fire manipulation for arson, including sabotaging sprinkler systems.

## Personality

Aaron is sadistic, vengeful, and fixated on dominance through pain and fear. He speaks with a cruel playfulness that masks deep-seated rage, and his approach to conflict centers on causing maximum suffering rather than achieving tactical objectives. His torture of Sam - selecting a claw hammer and delivering a monologue about his father's philosophy on pain and power - reveals someone who has internalized violence as a framework for understanding the world. When confronted by others about his methods, he responds with threats and escalation rather than reflection.

Beneath the aggression, Aaron is driven by humiliation and a desperate need to prove his worth. His repeated defeats by a teenage girl destroyed his standing among both the Kingdom of Keys and the Philly Phreaks, the latter of whom called him "unoriginal and uninspired" before abandoning him. Rather than retreating permanently, Aaron chose to isolate himself and develop his powers in pursuit of personal revenge, reframing every setback as a tactical repositioning. He declared himself the sole Coyote - "The Coyotes are dead. Long live the Coyote" - and pursued Sam with single-minded obsession, conducting extensive surveillance and an escalating arson campaign designed to terrorize her before a final confrontation.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Primary adversary | Obsessively fixated on Sam after repeated humiliations. Tortured her during captivity, removed her fingernails. Sam scarred his face during her escape. Their final fight ended with his arrest. |
| Jordan Westwood (Safeguard) | Adversary | Fought Jordan during the initial Coyotes confrontation. Jordan hit him with a baseball bat during his attack on the Music Hall. |
| Mr. Polygraph | Kingdom handler | Broke Aaron's nose and assigned him to kill Bloodhound as punishment for losing Kingdom money. |
| Joseph Jones (Pumice) | Temporary ally | Formed an alliance based on shared hatred of Bloodhound. Pumice later turned on Aaron at the docks, punching him when he threatened Chrysalis. |
| Angela Perez (Chrysalis) | Temporary ally turned critic | Delivered a devastating assessment of Aaron's character, calling him unoriginal and telling him he was "not worth the bullet." |
| Daisy Zhen (Deathgirl) | Temporary ally | Participated in the ambush on Sam alongside Aaron and Pumice. Aaron berated her during the fight, calling her "useless." |
| The Vet (Dr. Fontana) | Medical provider | A veterinarian who treated criminals, including Aaron on multiple occasions. Advised Aaron to leave Philadelphia. |
| Katherine Huang | Defense attorney | Represented Aaron through Tremont & Fairfax. Her involvement inadvertently helped the Auditors trace connections between the law firm, the Kingdom of Keys, and Stheno Pharmaceuticals. |
| Kate Smith (Miss Mayfly) | Victim (probable) | Aaron is the presumed perpetrator of the fire that burned down Kate's house, though circumstances were ambiguous. Kate's powers originally manifested during a fire probably set by Aaron. |
| Derek Taylor (Bloodhound II) | Adversary | Helped Sam track Aaron using his enhanced werewolf sense of smell. Fought Aaron at the bridge construction site. |

## Trivia

- Aaron's physical description includes cornrows and wind chime earrings, details that helped Sundial's psychometric sketch confirm his identity during the Book 9 arson investigation.
- His former Coyotes gang members were all found dead in what was reported as a drive-by shooting, though the circumstances remain unexplained.
- The veterinarian who treated Aaron, Dr. Fontana, is referred to as "Doc" in AMK.1 and "The Vet" in AMK.2. He repeatedly advised Aaron that he was not suited for the criminal lifestyle.
- Aaron's fire powers are functionally distinct from Alex Kirby's (Hellhound) pyrokinesis; Aaron's are described as chaotic and gaze-based, while Alex's involve pressurized flammable gas jets with more controlled application.
- His arson campaign in Book 9 triggered a wave of copycat arsons across Philadelphia, making it difficult to determine which fires were directly his work.
- Sam feels unexpectedly conflicted about Aaron's lengthy 38-year sentence despite their violent history.
- Aaron's father apparently espoused a philosophy about pain and power that Aaron internalized and repeated during his torture of Sam.
- The Kingdom of Keys funded his defense through Tremont & Fairfax, though Katherine Huang herself was genuinely unaware of the Kingdom connection.
- During the Kingdom meeting in AMK.1, Mr. Polygraph initially threatened a Yakuza-style punishment -- cutting off Aaron's pinky finger -- before relenting and breaking his nose with a punch instead.
- When explaining his defeat to the vet in AMK.2, Aaron fabricated the excuse that Sam had suddenly developed "knives for arms," which the vet dismissed.
- The Phreaks' rejection of Aaron in AMK.2 centered not just on his tactical failures but on a comparison to their former leader Patches, who they said genuinely cared for the group's members -- something Aaron never did.
- After his abandonment by the Phreaks, Aaron considered heading to Atlantic City or nearby counties, reframing the vet's advice to leave Philadelphia as a "tactical retreat" rather than admitting defeat.
- Pumice referenced having a "secret weapon" when he and Aaron formed their alliance at the warehouse near the docks in AMK.1, foreshadowing Deathgirl's involvement in the ambush.
