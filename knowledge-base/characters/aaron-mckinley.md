## Background

Aaron McKinley was the leader of the Tacony Coyotes, a local teen gang operating out of the area beneath the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge in Northeast Philadelphia. He possessed fire-ignition powers activated by his gaze, making him the only metahuman in the group and the source of his authority.

His criminal trajectory escalated dramatically after his first encounter with Sam Small (Arc 2), which ended with Sam biting into his shoulder and breaking his collarbone. Humiliated and facing Kingdom retribution for lost money, Aaron was assigned to kill Bloodhound. He allied with members of the Philly Phreaks, identified Sam's civilian identity, and ambushed her - resulting in her capture and torture. Sam's escape left Aaron with eight jagged scars across his face (Arc 4). Abandoned by the Phreaks and treated by a criminal veterinarian, Aaron retreated from Philadelphia while his fire powers evolved. He returned months later to conduct a calculated arson and stalking campaign across Tacony (Arc 9), ending with his arrest and a 38-year sentence at Daedalus. While incarcerated, Mr. Antithesis recruited him into the Kingdom as "Mr. Prometheus," offering Fly and a Camden fiefdom in exchange for killing Sam.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

No official PERKS assessment on file.

### Abilities

- **Fire Ignition (Gaze-Based)** - Aaron's original power allows him to ignite flammable materials and generate fire through his gaze. Initial manifestation produced standard yellow-orange flames capable of setting objects and people on fire, weakening metal supports, and creating area denial.
- **Fire Color Spectrum (Evolved)** - Over time, Aaron developed the ability to produce multiple types of fire with distinct properties. Yellow flames represent his baseline ability. Red flames are hotter and more focused. Blue flames produce toxic fumes. White flames represent his most advanced and volatile manifestation, sometimes appearing unexpectedly even to Aaron himself.
- **Smoke Generation** - Aaron can produce thick smoke to obscure vision, create smokescreens for escape, and fill enclosed spaces. This ability became more pronounced as his powers evolved.
- **Fire Immunity** - Aaron is unharmed by his own flames, as demonstrated when Jordan threw a burning cloak onto him during their initial fight and he remained unaffected.
- **Toxic Fume Tolerance** - Through deliberate exposure to his own blue fire's toxic byproducts, Aaron built a tolerance to the fumes that would incapacitate others.

### Limitations

- **Gaze Dependency** - Aaron's fire-ignition power requires his gaze, making it vulnerable to visual obstruction. Sam neutralized this during their first fight by spitting blood into his eyes.
- **Respiratory Damage** - Prolonged exposure to his own blue fire's toxic fumes caused significant deterioration of Aaron's lungs, noted by the veterinarian who treated him.
- **Inconsistent Control** - Aaron's evolved fire abilities, particularly white fire, sometimes manifested unpredictably, suggesting incomplete mastery over his more advanced powers.
- **Physical Limitations** - Despite his metahuman fire abilities, Aaron possesses no enhanced durability or healing. He sustained severe injuries across multiple fights, requiring treatment from a criminal-affiliated veterinarian.

### Training & Skills

- Street fighting experience as a gang leader, though lacking formal combat training.
- Proficiency in psychological warfare and intimidation tactics, including orchestrating indirect threatening messages through chains of unwitting intermediaries.
- Surveillance and stalking skills, demonstrated by his methodical tracking of Sam's movements around her school, home, and known locations.
- Knowledge of accelerant placement and fire manipulation for arson, including sabotaging sprinkler systems.

## Personality

Aaron is sadistic, vengeful, and fixated on dominance through pain and fear. He speaks with a cruel playfulness that masks deep-seated rage, centering conflict on maximum suffering rather than tactical objectives. His torture of Sam - selecting a claw hammer while delivering a monologue about his father's philosophy on pain and power - reveals someone who has internalized violence as a framework for understanding the world.

Beneath the aggression is humiliation and a desperate need to prove his worth. Repeated defeats by a teenage girl destroyed his standing among the Kingdom and the Phreaks. Rather than retreating permanently, he reframed every setback as a tactical repositioning, declaring himself the sole Coyote and pursuing Sam with single-minded obsession. During his time away from Philadelphia, he attended therapy but weaponized the self-awareness he gained, describing his anger and control issues as "gifts" rather than problems.

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sam Small (Bloodhound) | Primary adversary | Obsessively fixated after repeated humiliations. Tortured her during captivity (Arc 4); Sam scarred his face during her escape. Final fight ended with his arrest (Arc 9). |
| Jordan Westwood (Safeguard) | Adversary | Fought during the initial Coyotes confrontation (Arc 2) and the Music Hall attack (Arc 9). |
| Mr. Polygraph | Kingdom handler | Broke Aaron's nose and assigned him to kill Bloodhound as repayment for lost money (Arc 4). |
| Mr. Tyrannosaur | Kingdom associate | Present during Aaron's Kingdom summons; physically restrained him. |
| Joseph Jones (Pumice) | Temporary ally | Alliance based on shared hatred of Bloodhound. Later turned on Aaron at the docks. |
| Angela Perez (Chrysalis) | Temporary ally turned critic | Called him "unoriginal" and "not worth the bullet" before the Phreaks abandoned him. |
| Daisy Zhen (Deathgirl) | Temporary ally | Participated in the ambush on Sam. Aaron berated her as "useless" and accidentally set her hair on fire. |
| The Vet (Dr. Fontana) | Medical provider | Criminal-affiliated veterinarian who treated Aaron multiple times and advised him to leave Philadelphia. |
| Katherine Huang | Defense attorney | Represented Aaron through Tremont & Fairfax; her involvement helped the Auditors trace Kingdom-Stheno connections. |
| Kate Smith (Miss Mayfly) | Victim (possible) | A fire broke out at Kate's house during the arson campaign, though circumstances are ambiguous - the fire was yellow-orange (not matching Aaron's evolved signatures) and Kate had her own reasons and means to start a fire. Kate's smoke-absorption powers manifested during this blaze. |
| Derek Taylor (Bloodhound II) | Adversary | Helped Sam track Aaron by scent (Arc 9). |
| Trent Fairfax (Mr. Antithesis) | Kingdom recruiter | Visited Aaron in prison, recruiting him as "Mr. Prometheus" with Fly, Camden territory, and millions in exchange for killing Sam (Intermission 15.5). |

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Supporting Antagonist

    Introduced as leader of the Tacony Coyotes in Chapter 20. Sam and Jordan confront his gang beneath the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge. Aaron reveals fire-ignition powers, sets Sam's costume ablaze, and collapses part of the overpass. Sam bites into his shoulder, breaks his collarbone, and neutralizes his fire by spitting blood in his eyes. Jordan steals the gang's drugs and money.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Main Antagonist / Interlude

    In Interlude AMK.1, Aaron recovers from his defeat. He seeks treatment from a criminal veterinarian, is summoned by the Kingdom of Keys where Mr. Polygraph breaks his nose and assigns him to kill Bloodhound. Aaron resets his own nose, declares the Coyotes dead, and allies with Pumice. He surveils Tacony Charter Academy and identifies Sam's civilian identity. He ambushes Sam with a crowbar while she walks home alone through the snow (Ch. 50), initiating a brutal multi-phase assault. Pumice, Deathgirl, and Chrysalis join the attack. Sam is captured and tortured - Aaron removes her fingernails with a claw hammer while Deathgirl breaks her left hand. Sam escapes by growing teeth from her body, scarring Aaron's face in the process (Chs. 51-52). In Interlude AMK.2, the Phreaks confront him at the docks, criticize his leadership, and abandon him. Aaron retreats to an abandoned basement where he discovers a new blue fire ability that produces toxic fumes, damaging his lungs. The vet warns him about his deteriorating respiratory health. Aaron interprets advice to leave the city as a "tactical retreat" and departs Philadelphia.

??? warning "Book 9: Sheol"

Aaron is described wearing a blackout mask over his eyes as containment, with his right arm fully braced from wrist to shoulder as a result of Sam's injuries. Trent renames him "Mr. Prometheus" and recruits him into the Kingdom of Keys, offering a dose of Fly (synergistic with pyrogenetic powers), Kingdom membership, a fiefdom over Camden, and millions of dollars in exchange for making his own jailbreak and killing Samantha Small.


## Trivia

- Originally described with cornrows and wind chime earrings; by Arc 9 his appearance had changed to an undercut with two long braids, well-fed and tanned. Sundial's psychometric sketch from his original description helped confirm his identity during the arson investigation.
- His former Coyotes gang members were all found dead in what was reported as a drive-by shooting, though the circumstances remain unexplained.
- His fire powers are functionally distinct from Alex Kirby's (Hellhound) pyrokinesis; Aaron's are chaotic and gaze-based, while Alex's involve pressurized flammable gas jets with more controlled application.
- His arson campaign triggered a wave of copycat arsons across Philadelphia, making it difficult to determine which fires were directly his work.
- Sam feels unexpectedly conflicted about his lengthy 38-year sentence despite their violent history.
- Aaron's father ("Papa") is confirmed dead. He espoused a philosophy about pain and power - taught through "belt leather and hard lessons" - that Aaron internalized. His parents kicked him out before the story, telling him he was not their problem anymore.
- The Kingdom funded his defense through Tremont & Fairfax, though Katherine Huang was genuinely unaware of the Kingdom connection.
- When explaining his defeat to the vet, Aaron fabricated the excuse that Sam had developed "knives for arms," which the vet dismissed.
- The Phreaks' rejection centered not just on his tactical failures but on a comparison to their former leader Patches, who they said genuinely cared for members - something Aaron never did.
- Aaron got dental work done before his final confrontation with Sam, showing up with perfect teeth.
- During the final fight, he soaked the abandoned house in water to prevent accidental fire - a level of strategic planning contrasting with his earlier impulsive behavior.
- Each color of his fire has a distinct smell: yellow flames smell like rotten eggs (sulfurous), white flames produce an ammonia smell.
