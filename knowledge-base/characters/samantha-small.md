## Background

Samantha Small was a fourteen-year-old Jewish girl living in Mayfair, Philadelphia when a boating accident on Pop-Pop Moe's boat in August 2023 triggered her Activation Event, granting shark-derived metahuman abilities including enhanced bite force, blood-sensing, accelerated regeneration, and tooth generation from any part of her body. Registered through the JLUMA system shortly after, she was recruited into the Young Defenders by Liberty Belle (Diane Williams), who became her first mentor. Sam's early career as the vigilante Bloodhound was a brutal education: within her first year, she witnessed a Kingdom of Keys execution, had her family home destroyed, was tortured by Aaron McKinley, watched Liberty Belle die in her arms, and sustained massive radiation exposure confronting Chernobyl alone. During her subsequent hospitalization, she was diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar disorder alongside her pre-existing ADHD, began treatment with lithium, and met her maternal grandmother Camilla de Leon for the first time.

After recovering, Sam co-founded the Auditors with Jordan Westwood, Connor Spinelli, and Joshua Pleasants (Miasma) - an independent team operating out of the Tacony Music Hall, dedicated to exposing the Kingdom of Keys. Over the next two years, she evolved from impulsive field operative to strategic leader, guiding the Auditors through escalating conflicts involving the Kingdom, the power-drug network Rogue Wave, the government-sanctioned Argus Corps, and individual antagonists including the returning Aaron McKinley and the white supremacist Shrike. She navigated anti-vigilante legislation pushed by Councilwoman Maya Richardson, negotiated a protection arrangement with Rogue Wave to safeguard her family, and began mentoring powered youth through a community center program established by Councilman Jamal Davis.

Sam retired the Bloodhound identity after killing Niles Nolan (Shrike) in a dissociative episode during their final confrontation, passing the mantle to Derek Taylor as Bloodhound II. After months of attempted retirement spent working as an EMT intern and running the mentorship program, she acknowledged that she had never truly stopped doing vigilante work and adopted the new identity of Miss Megalodon in February 2026. She currently operates in Mayfair under this alias while continuing her roles as peer mentor, EMT trainee, and de facto intelligence coordinator for Philadelphia's independent hero community.

Sam is the daughter of Benjamin Small, a city planner, and Rachel Small (nee Blanc), a librarian. Her paternal grandfather Morris "Pop-pop Moe" Small is a retired engineer with historical connections to Daedalus Correctional Facility and Liberty Belle. Her maternal grandfather Victor Blanc is an estranged figure whose personality reveals troubling parallels with Sam's own tendencies. She has no siblings, stands five feet ten inches tall, and has a broad-shouldered, wide-hipped, rectangular "powerlifter" build.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | G4/B/C |
| **Category** | Gigant (primary), Brain (secondary), Create (tertiary) |
| **Power Ranking** | 4/10 |
| **Control** | 5/10 |
| **Hostility** | 6/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 2/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 5/10 |

Sam's primary classification is Gigant (enhanced physical attributes), secondary Brain (blood-sensing), and tertiary Create (tooth generation). Her power ranking is modest compared to heavy hitters like Captain Plasma, but her threat level is elevated by tactical intelligence, pain tolerance, and willingness to sustain injuries that would incapacitate other combatants.

### Abilities

- **Enhanced Bite Force** - Bite force dramatically exceeding human norms. She can bite through flesh, bone, and some industrial materials. Her most reliable close-quarters offensive capability.
- **Blood Sense** - Sensory ability to detect and identify blood within a significant radius. She can sense blood on objects, detect internal bleeding, identify drugs or foreign substances in a person's bloodstream, and assess injuries with diagnostic precision. She identifies Jump and Fly users by their fluorescent orange, "fizzy" blood signature from blocks away, and uses long-dried blood particles on Philadelphia's streets as a LIDAR-like map for spatial awareness and navigation. Functions as her primary investigative, medical, and environmental awareness tool.
- **Accelerated Regeneration** - Heals from injuries at a dramatically accelerated rate. She has recovered from crushed tracheas, severe puncture wounds, extensive burns, broken bones, gunshot wounds, and cardiac arrest. Regeneration requires high-calorie, high-protein nutritional support and is not instantaneous; severe injuries still require days to weeks of recovery. Central to her heroic philosophy: she views absorbing damage others cannot survive as a moral obligation.
- **Tooth Generation (Odontogenesis)** - Can grow teeth from any surface of her body. First manifested under extreme stress during Arc 4. Tactical applications include:
  - **Instant Armor** - Growing overlapping teeth across body parts as improvised armor. Complete full-body coverage first manifested during the Shrike confrontation (Arc 14), though it triggers claustrophobia linked to her Activation Event.
  - **Blading** - Growing a single tooth through her forearm as a concealed cutting implement, useful for misdirection.
  - **Tooth-Knuckles** - Her most common offensive application. Teeth from the knuckles enhance striking damage. She developed fine control over tooth sharpness by Arc 5, with gloves slotted for teeth to fit through as pointed knuckledusters.
  - **Shin-Teeth** - A tooth grown through an exposed costume gap for kicks, capable of concentrating enough point pressure to crack Pumice's stone body (Arc 6).
  - **Palm-Teeth** - Teeth from palms for extra grappling grip or as slashing weapons.
  - **Biting Surfaces** - Teeth on forearms and other contact points during grappling.
- **Enhanced Durability** - Physical toughness exceeding baseline humans. Her jaw absorbs punches with minimal effect via a reflexive lockjaw response. She has sustained extraordinary cumulative damage without permanent disability, though Dr. Song has warned of long-term consequences.
- **Equilibrium State** - Discovered during Arc 15 that she can sustain physical activity indefinitely by reaching equilibrium between exertion and regeneration, eliminating normal fatigue.

### Limitations

- Regeneration is not instantaneous; severe injuries require days to weeks of recovery with medical intervention. Dr. Song has noted small benign tumors, chronic organ damage, and extensive scar tissue, warning that regeneration might accelerate cancer.
- Full-body Instant Armor triggers claustrophobia and dissociative episodes rooted in her Activation Event (drowning).
- Tooth generation is physically strenuous and draining.
- Experienced Hypeman withdrawal (headaches, tremors, shaking) after a single use in Arc 11. Nicotine partially alleviates symptoms, leading to an ongoing struggle with cigarettes.
- Blood sense can be overwhelming in environments with large amounts of blood or many injured individuals.
- Baseline-weight human who can be physically overpowered by opponents with superior strength, size, or weaponry.
- Takes lithium, Concerta (methylphenidate), Zofran (as needed), Prazosin, and Desvenlafaxine for bipolar disorder, ADHD, and PTSD. Medication disruption affects cognitive function and emotional regulation.

### Training & Skills

- **Boxing** - Primary martial art, trained by Multiplex. Now teaches boxing to teammates and mentees.
- **Aikido** - Supplementary training from Rampart.
- **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu** - Supplementary grappling training.
- **First Aid / EMT** - Trained in first aid by Gossamer starting in Arc 5; supplemented by Tasha's anatomy knowledge from Arc 8 onward. Works as an EMT intern, combining blood sense with formal medical knowledge to diagnose internal injuries without imaging equipment. Regularly treats civilians on patrol using blood sense to detect injuries behind closed doors.
- **Dirty Fighting** - Fights pragmatically with no code of honor, freely using deception, environmental manipulation, and psychological tactics.
- **Investigative Skills** - Inherited Liberty Belle's detective files and developed her own methodology combining surveillance, informant networks, and strategic intelligence distribution. Capable of lockpicking, undercover work, and evidence documentation.
- **Strategic Leadership** - Coordinates multiple vigilante teams (Auditors, Tacony Titans) and institutional allies (DVD, FBI, Councilman Davis) as an intelligence hub for Philadelphia's hero community.
- **Territorial Mapping** - Studies city planning maps, sewer plans, and infrastructure overlays to memorize patrol routes, sight lines, choke points, and escape routes.
- **PR and Media Strategy** - Deliberately uses media coverage, FOIA-able police reports, and bystander video as weapons against opponents.
- **Peer Mentorship** - Runs training sessions for powered youth covering power control, grounding techniques, safety protocols, and de-escalation.

## Personality

Sam is energetic, self-deprecating, and impulsive, with a moral compass that bends but does not break under extraordinary pressure. Her narration features stream-of-consciousness thoughts, parenthetical asides, and a distinctive blend of teenage vernacular with unexpectedly sharp observations. She possesses an overwhelming "truth drive" - a compulsive need to uncover and expose concealed information, articulated through the phrase "if it can be destroyed by the truth it deserves to be destroyed by the truth," though she lacks the political sophistication to fully appreciate the principle's complexity. She is deeply funny in a self-lacerating way, frequently undercutting heroism or vulnerability with dark humor. In combat, she uses humor as targeted bullying designed to make opponents angry and sloppy.

Beneath the wisecracking exterior, Sam carries extraordinary trauma. Her relationship with danger is paradoxical: not suicidal, but an adrenaline junkie whose overwhelming lust for life manifests as seemingly self-destructive behavior. Her regeneration enables and reinforces this pattern - because she heals from injuries that would permanently disable others, she treats her body as expendable in service of protecting those who cannot recover as she can. Her core philosophical position is that regeneration creates an ethical obligation to absorb harm and to offer mercy repeatedly, even when it fails, because most people only get to make the mistake of showing mercy to the wrong person once.

Sam's mental health is a persistent thread. Her bipolar disorder manifests in identifiable patterns she has learned to self-monitor, including flagging potential hypomanic episodes. She takes medication consistently and has voluntarily requested therapy on multiple occasions. She experiences dissociative episodes, hypervigilance, stress-related hair-pulling, and difficulty sleeping. Her ADHD contributes to her stream-of-consciousness processing style, and her autism manifests in intense focus, pattern recognition, and occasional difficulty with social conventions.

Her relationships are defined by fierce protectiveness and an inability to delegate risk, rooted in a generational self-reliance philosophy traced from Holocaust survivor Leah Small through Pop-pop Moe and Benjamin to Sam herself. Family therapy identified that Sam's vigilantism and her father's gun ownership stem from the same conviction that institutions cannot be trusted to protect loved ones. Multiple people have confronted her self-sacrificial tendencies - Maggie, Jennifer Patterson, and Maxwell Martinez chief among them. The central arc of Sam's character development is her gradual acceptance that she cannot personally be present for every crisis, and that systems she builds can function without her. Maxwell's diagnosis of a "load-bearing life" - where stepping back causes everything to collapse - prompted her to seek sustainability rather than oscillating between burnout and compulsion.

## Arc Appearances

??? warning "Book 1: Pup"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam's boating accident on Pop-Pop Moe's boat triggers her Activation Event, granting shark-based powers. She undergoes her JLUMA interview on August 1, 2023, and is registered with a provisional license. Liberty Belle recruits her into the Young Defenders. Sam runs her first patrol with Gale (apprehending Mudslide at a Walgreens robbery) and encounters Jordan Westwood as the villain "Safeguard." The two develop a friendship, teaming up as the vigilante duo "Big Bad Wolf." A staged fake heist at the Dobson Textile Factory goes catastrophically wrong when Kingdom of Keys operatives arrive, and Sam witnesses Mr. Polygraph execute a man. Sam and Jordan escape with Alex Garcia's drone support. The arc ends with the DVD adults learning about the Kingdom through Sam's intelligence.

??? warning "Book 2: Keys"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam reports Kingdom intelligence to the full DVD, casually revealing her regeneration for the first time. She attends Rosh Hashanah at Pop-Pop Moe's in Ventnor, NJ, where his Shulchan Arukh quote ("Do not stand idly by the blood of your neighbor") deeply affects her. She trains with Rampart in boxing, BJJ, and bone conditioning, and starts dating Gale. Sam and Jordan confront the Coyotes gang and Aaron McKinley beneath the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge. Jordan's month-long solo Kingdom investigation leads to an undercover infiltration of the Crescent nightclub where Sam identifies operatives Mrs. Heartbeat, Dr. Xenograft, and Mr. T-Rex. The Kingdom tracks Sam through scent-trailing basset-crow hybrids, and Mr. T-Rex destroys the Small family home in retaliation. Sam moves in with Lily Chen's family in Bridesburg. Her parents discover the full extent of her double life.

??? warning "Book 3: Dybbuk"

    **Role:** Main

    Living with Lily's family, Sam confesses her feelings to Jamila Fayad in Germantown, beginning their relationship. She attends a Demon Core concert in Camden where she punches a skinhead who grabs at Jamila's hijab. Sam participates in the Young Defenders' first full-team operation against the Philly Phreaks on South Street, fighting Patches and Deathgirl (revealed as a power copier). Spindle is confirmed as a double agent against the Phreaks. Liberty Belle returns bald from chemotherapy, revealing her cancer has spread with eight months to a year prognosis, and intensifies Sam's training across combat, tradecraft, and surveillance. On Halloween, Sam's team infiltrates a Kingdom warehouse at 4547 Trenton Avenue, where Sam witnesses Mr. Polygraph execute a man. Sam conducts weeks of solo surveillance on Belle, discovering her visits to the PES refinery, a cancer clinic, and a Professor Franklin memorial bench. The arc culminates when Belle invites Chernobyl to the PES refinery in defiance of government stand-down orders. Sam disobeys evacuation and intervenes, hurling sharpened metal pipes at Chernobyl's armor. Despite their combined efforts, Chernobyl kills Belle with a pile driver spike. Belle dies in Sam's arms, her last words an apology and acknowledgment that Sam was right to come.

??? warning "Book 4: Exorcism"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam inherits Liberty Belle's detective files and case archives at a will reading, along with a personal letter acknowledging her potential as a detective. She confronts Councilman Davis about the government's role in protecting Chernobyl, leading him to propose "Young Defenders Dark" - an off-the-books team supervised by Miasma, who suggests the name "The Auditors." NSRA agents attempt to confiscate Belle's materials but are turned away by Miasma's legal arguments. Sam undergoes power testing with Dr. Leonard Harris, who measures her bite force at over 3,600 Newtons, confirms blood sense as ESP triggered by airborne blood particles with 80+ meter range, and classifies her as a "Buffet Style" metahuman.

    Walking home from testing, Sam is ambushed by Aaron McKinley, Pumice, Deathgirl, and Chrysalis. Aaron removes all five fingernails on her right hand with a claw hammer while Deathgirl smashes her left hand. Under extreme stress, Sam discovers tooth generation - growing teeth from her wrists to saw through restraints and from her knuckles to fight free. Miasma raids the NSRA office in Hatboro-Horsham for Chernobyl intelligence, but four security guards are killed and Miasma is framed for the murders. The Auditors investigate posing as student journalists and prove the Kingdom was behind the frame job by identifying Mr. Polygraph and Mr. ESP impersonating NSRA agents.

    Agent Torres provides Chernobyl's location in the old Arch Street subway station. Sam, Jordan, and Spindle enter the tunnels, are ambushed by Mr. ESP and Mudslide, and Sam is shot twice through the abdomen. After Chernobyl dispatches Mr. ESP, Sam faces him one-on-one, dismantling his suit with tooth-covered hands while he refuses to strike back, saying she reminds him of his daughter. Sam chooses mercy - hugging him and asking him to turn himself in - before collapsing from radiation exposure. She is hospitalized at Jefferson as a Jane Doe. The arc establishes her defining moral principle: regeneration creates an ethical obligation to absorb harm and extend mercy.

??? warning "Intermission 4.5: Amnion"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam recovers from radiation-induced injuries. Dr. Desai identifies PTSD and possible bipolar disorder alongside pre-existing ADHD, suggests an autism assessment, and begins lithium treatment. Sam meets her maternal grandmother Camilla de Leon for the first time, learning of her Hispanic heritage. She celebrates her fifteenth birthday in the hospital.

??? warning "Book 5: Mayfly"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam returns home on April 18, 2024, to a rebuilt family home and resumes school with a buzz cut and diminished muscle mass. She trains with Gossamer at DVD HQ in boxing and first aid (mandated by Crossroads). She celebrates Passover Seder with her family and Jamila, performing the Ma Nishtana as the youngest present.

    Sam and Jordan resume patrols from the Tacony Music Hall as the Auditors, with Sam as the Big Bad Wolf (wolf mask, cloak, hood) and Jordan as Safeguard. They encounter the Tacony Titans - Sundial, Bubble, and Moonshot - who propose an alliance. When Ricochet attacks her neighborhood, Sam disobeys Crossroads' order to stay away and joins the fight alongside Playback, Crossroads, and the newly-appearing Miss Mayfly. Afterward, she walks home using blood sense to detect injuries behind closed doors and treats civilians - thirty minutes fighting, three hours helping, establishing her community healer role.

    Derek Taylor approaches Sam, revealing he is a werewolf, and asks for help stopping his best friend Elias Franklin (Chimera), who took Fly and plans to attack the IBC offices. Sam and Derek confront Chimera on the seventh floor; Derek saves Sam by holding a switchblade to his own throat, gambling on Elias's love. Elias reveals his Fly supplier was a bald man with lightning powers (later identified as Sparkplug). The Auditors investigate the drug network, identify Sparkplug as kingpin and Squeal as his dealer, and run a sting operation that goes sideways into a warehouse fight.

    Sundial proposes pooling resources, and the combined teams plan a joint operation at Dobson Mills warehouse. Miss Mayfly crashes the operation with stink bombs and firecrackers, forcing improvisation. During the chaotic battle, Sam demonstrates improved tooth-knuckle control - teeth deliberately duller, extending only centimeters for striking force. Jordan bluffs Sparkplug with a gun to save the hostage Miss Mayfly. After the battle, Sam cradles the injured Mayfly and recognizes her as Kate Smith when her gas mask shatters. Kate reveals she started vigilante work while Sam was hospitalized: "someone had to keep watch." Sam learns Kate led an entire civilian support team - Team Mayfly, including Tasha Reynolds and other school friends.

    Sam grounds Miss Mayfly from field ops and negotiates a tech-support-only compromise. The combined teams execute a takedown at Sparkplug's Dorchester condo: Jordan clones an RFID key fob, Derek scent-tracks to the unit, and Sam fights Sparkplug in his bathrobe amid an apartment rigged with metal studs. She delivers a sedative injection while absorbing electrocution. Sparkplug (Christian Praznik) reveals during interrogation that Rogue Wave is an organization, not a person. The arc concludes with Sam fighting Kate at their childhood basketball court after Kate takes Jump and gains iron skin. Kate's emotional core erupts - abandonment, class resentment, jealousy - and she wins physically but agrees to hang up her costume.

??? warning "Book 6: Sideshow"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam's summer routine settles in: dates with Jamila, training with Rampart, and Jump-related incidents with Bubble. Kate is estranged after the basketball court fight; Team Mayfly is splintering. Prosecutor Anne-Marie Gibson contacts Sam as a key witness for Illya Fedorov's trial. Sam undergoes weeks of deposition preparation, reveals the NSRA's years-long collaboration with Illya, and gives her deposition on July 22nd facing defense attorney Gerald Caldwell.

    Jamila breaks up with Sam, revealing she believes she is asexual/aromantic, is terrified of dying, and that their paths are fundamentally incompatible. Sam spirals into a 36-hour depression. At the DVD HQ, she spars with Rampart and manages to cut his cheek for the first time. At a Young Defenders meeting, Gale announces she is stepping back and Puppeteer reveals a diagnosis precluding advancement - losses that devastate Sam on top of the breakup.

    On patrol, Sam discovers a man undergoing a horrific Jump mutation in Love Park - metal objects erupting from his body. She provides first aid to an injured civilian and fights Pumice, using a shin-tooth (growing a tooth through an exposed costume gap for a roundhouse kick) to create an actual crack in Pumice's stone body. Chimera/Elias Franklin is identified as the Phreaks' ally providing tainted Jump variants.

    Sam testifies at Illya Fedorov's trial and refuses NSRA suppression orders. The Phreaks attack the courthouse; Sam undergoes a rage-fueled physical transformation (denticle plates, bone blades, throat barbs) and defeats Deathgirl in a savage one-on-one fight, then leads search and rescue using blood sense. She receives a call from her father expressing pride for the first time. She begins her sophomore year amid riot police and metal detectors, and is invited to speak at a congressional hearing.

??? warning "Book 7: Security"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam returns to Tacony Charter Academy as a sophomore to find it transformed into a militarized zone with metal detectors, armed guards, and X-ray scanners. On the second day, she intervenes when security guard Lewis Ridley violently assaults a Black freshman named James Jackson over a hat violation. Sam's aikido training kicks in and she throws Ridley to the ground. Jordan captures it on video, reversing Principal Heckerman's initial threat of expulsion. Sam receives one week of detention.

    The guards retaliate with a targeted "random search." Sam and Jordan investigate, discovering all hostile guards are regulars at Patty's, a cop bar associated with Pattinson's Pals. They enter Patty's and overhear Ridley trash-talking Sam's family. Patriot and Egalitarian corner them in the parking lot, ordering Sam to drop her "little crusade." Sam, Jordan, Derek, and Connor create an anonymous whistleblower website that floods with submissions of guard abuse. Copycat sites spring up across Philadelphia schools.

    Sam begins mentoring Flashpoint (Maggie O'Brien), a 15-year-old with repulsion field powers. During a training session, Citizen Zero and Pattinson's Pals followers ambush them - Zero's ranged power negation (unlike Mr. Nothing's touch-based) strips their powers entirely. They flee to the Music Hall, powers returning as they escape Zero's range.

    At Rosh Hashanah dinner, Uncle Shelly reveals Pop-Pop Moe's firm helped build Daedalus Correctional Facility. Cousin Abigail Silverman independently deduces Sam's identity as Bloodhound. Moe reveals Sam broke his boat during her Activation - "you had just become this snarling thing of the water" - a detail Sam had no memory of. The family performs Tashlich at the pier.

    Sam rallies the full Auditors team: Sam, Jordan, Spindle, Tasha, and Flashpoint. She reverse-pickpockets Patriot with her blood at a press conference, then tracks him to a warehouse where she records him discussing national expansion plans and anti-superhuman legislation. Jordan schedules a cron job to post their compiled evidence during the homecoming dance as an alibi.

    At homecoming, the post goes live. Patriot storms the gymnasium with Egalitarian and tactical police. Egalitarian's vertigo power collapses every non-powered person in the gym - except Sam and Jordan, outing them both as powered. Mr. Weston triggers a cascade of "I'm Jordan Westwood!" from students and staff. Sam steps between Patriot and Jordan and is brutally beaten - broken nose, cracked ribs, throat grab. She involuntarily grows teeth from her palms. The students stagger upright through Egalitarian's vertigo to form a human wall with linked arms and phones recording. Jordan escapes via spatial manipulation. Sam is hospitalized over the weekend.

    Sam testifies as Bloodhound in costume before the Governmental Affairs Committee in Washington, D.C., advocating for independent oversight, body cameras for superheroes, and psychological evaluations. She experiences a PTSD panic attack during testimony but pushes through.

??? warning "Book 8: Big"

    **Role:** Main

    Maya Richardson wins the City Council special election. Sam's parents recognize her as the woman with Mr. T-Rex when their house was destroyed. Sam takes Maggie on her first real patrol - rescuing a cat, de-escalating a street argument - and articulates an 80/20 ratio of community service to supervillain fighting.

    Sam and Jordan visit Republican candidate Richard Duvall with T-Rex attack video but find him condescending and racist. Councilman Davis confirms DVDs have known Richardson is Mrs. Zenith but cannot prosecute through the Kingdom's layers of intermediaries. Sam, Jordan, and Tasha conduct a two-day investigation including dumpster diving Richardson's campaign office and going undercover at her office (Sam as "Sarah from Temple University" in a blonde wig). Richardson wins with 81 percent. Richard Johnson is confirmed as Patriot; his disappearance deflates Pattinson's Pals overnight.

    Sam proposes revisiting the Crescent nightclub. Gossamer creates a disguise and coaches her persona-building. At the Crescent, Sam plants surveillance bugs, orders a whiskey sour (her super-liver handles it), and slips into the back hallways where she discovers a Kingdom operations map marked with red circles on City Hall, the Zoo, high schools, and the docks. Mudslide catches her in the back hallways and shoots her through the upper arm. Sam escapes using blood scent navigation and field-dresses her wound.

    Sam presents intel at a DVD debrief. The adults order no more unauthorized solo missions; Sam nods "like a liar." She trains Maggie in combat behind the Music Hall, where Maggie confesses dark thoughts about her powers and Sam firmly redirects her. On an unofficial patrol with Rampart, Sam confirms Rogue Wave as a mind-control trigger - mentioning it to a captured thug transforms him into a mindless attacker.

    Playback arrives at the Music Hall bleeding, revealing the Kingdom's "Operation Ivory" - a zoo heist. At the Philadelphia Zoo, Sam and Tasha investigate. Sam's breakthrough theory: the Kingdom's interest is the land and buildings, not the animals. They encounter Dr. Trinh-Norwood (Mrs. Xenograft) in the reptile house, who admits her Kingdom involvement is "purely financial."

    Sam rallies roughly thirty powered allies across Philadelphia for the anticipated heist. Gossamer fits her with a winterized costume. On a snow day, the heist begins: Mr. Tyrannosaur crashes through the rhino enclosure while Kingdom goons take hostages. Sam fights through groups of goons while the DVD heavy hitters engage Tyrannosaur. She notices the goons are herding hostages away from the Reptile House and realizes the entire siege is a smokescreen. Inside the darkened Reptile House, she discovers the real heist: Mudslide liquefying poison dart frog tanks while Mr. Nothing and Mrs. Heartbeat assist. Mr. Nothing grabs Sam's chin - the only exposed skin - nullifying all her powers and holding a pistol to her kneecap.

    Maggie saves Sam with a repulsion-field fastball to Nothing's temple. The ensuing fight sees Mudslide turn the floor to quicksand and hurl liquefied glass while Sam and Maggie battle Nothing and Mudslide respectively. Mudslide shoots Maggie three times in the chest - Sam's old bulletproof vest absorbs the impacts but Maggie sustains broken ribs and internal bleeding. Sam zip-ties Nothing after a brutal hand-to-hand exchange, then physically snaps Maggie out of a berserker state when she nearly crushes Mudslide's head with her repulsion fields.

    Nothing and Mudslide are captured. Tyrannosaur escapes; Mrs. Heartbeat escapes with some frogs. Multiplex validates Sam: without her, they would have missed the real heist entirely. He acknowledges Maggie as a student of "the Diane school" of superheroism.

    **Role:** Main

    Weeks after the zoo siege, Sam patrols mostly alone while Maggie recovers. Jordan announces a full-ride MIT scholarship, triggering Sam's fear that everyone is moving on while she remains stuck. A garbage can fire near school triggers a severe PTSD panic attack - fingernail pain in her right hand linked to Aaron McKinley's torture. Jordan and Tasha conduct fire-exposure experiments, discovering the trigger is territory-linked: fires near familiar places provoke the strongest reactions.

    A fire destroys Amy's coffee shop; Sundial's psychometry at the scene produces a sketch matching Aaron McKinley. The arsonist was present during the rescue, watching Sam from the crowd. Jordan cross-references the fires with Sam's patrol routes and discovers they form a circle around her school. Aaron's fire powers have evolved dramatically - from yellow to red, blue, and invisible fire - with a trail of arsons stretching from Bucks County toward Philadelphia. He plants a "Happy Nails & Spa" gift card in Sam's locker with a hammer sticker, referencing the claw hammer torture.

    Sam and Derek track Aaron's scent through Tacony, confirming he has methodically mapped Sam's entire life. The trail leads to a construction site beneath the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge. The first fight erupts; Sam uses Fury Forge's fire blanket to block flames, but Aaron escapes. He retaliates by attacking the Music Hall directly, then sets fires at the library and pulls the school fire alarm, igniting Sam's sleeve and injuring six students. Sam sustains second-degree burns.

    At the hospital, Sam persuades Crossroads to use coin-flip precognition, extracting intelligence from an alternate timeline without Sam having to share her plans. Sam escapes at midnight. She discovers Kate Smith's house on fire - the origin ambiguous, as Kate had both means and motive. Sam rescues Kate upstairs, finding deliberate self-harm cuts on her arms, gives Kate her oxygen mask, and performs CPR until paramedics arrive.

    Sam forces Crossroads to narrow Aaron's location to an abandoned house near Vogt Park. In the flooded basement, Aaron monologues about weaponizing therapy. Sam crashes through the second floor and fights him through darkness, gasoline explosions, and hand-to-hand combat, smashing a foam capsule into his face to cut off his line-of-sight-dependent fire. She systematically dismantles him, deliberately dislocating his elbow - a message, not mercy. Aaron is dragged out in handcuffs.

    **Role:** Main

    Sam testifies in Aaron McKinley's arson deposition, facing defense attorney Katherine Huang of Tremont & Fairfax - the same firm later connected to both Kingdom legal defense and Argus Corps. Kate and Liam Smith are living with the Smalls while Kate recovers. Sam and Jordan pick up the first indirect evidence of a smoke-using vigilante clearing out drug houses, beginning the investigation into Soot.

    The Superhuman Activity Regulation Act (SARA) passes 12-5 in City Council, banning vigilante activities for anyone under eighteen. The Young Defenders formally dissolve. Sam and Lily refuse to quit; Gossamer commits to the Auditors. Jordan formally declares Sam the Auditors' leader. Sam turns sixteen during Passover.

    On a Kensington patrol, Sam and Maggie encounter Bash using a black autoinjector (Hypeman) and discover Rogue Wave's contracts have physiological enforcement - a dealer literally cannot answer questions about Rogue Wave without a blood vessel popping. They are arrested for obstruction and spend the night in holding. Sam encounters Soot directly for the first time robbing a loan shark. At a Rogue Wave marina distribution event, Sam and Jordan observe Monkey Business's contract-binding power in action. Soot is present and calls Sam "Smalls," showing pink fingernails - another data point connecting Soot to Kate.

    Jordan stages a cafeteria stunt to provoke Rogue Wave sleeper agents into revealing themselves. Officer Ridley attacks Jordan with a taser; Sam puts Ridley in a chokehold. Both receive suspensions. Sam builds a five-point evidence chain linking Kate to Soot. Jordan discovers Stheno Pharmaceuticals near Kingdom fronts on Trenton Avenue, incorporated by Tremont & Fairfax. Richardson announces Argus Corps: Patriot, Turbo Jett, Captain Devil, and Miasma.

    The Auditors infiltrate the Stheno warehouse. The mission spirals into a multi-faction battle when warehouse security, Soot, and Argus Corps all converge. Miasma deliberately turns around and pretends not to see Sam. Soot threatens to release chlorine gas; Sam refuses to abandon a zip-tied guard upstairs. She fights Patriot on the staircase, frees the guard, and jumps from the window as chemical drums chain-detonate. The warehouse explodes behind them as the Auditors flee in a taxicab, laughing hysterically.

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam confronts Kate about being Soot; Kate denies it cold. Nurse Sylvia diagnoses multiple ankle fractures from the warehouse escape. Sam begins boxing training with Multiplex, who identifies three core weaknesses: flinching instead of slipping, over-reliance on regeneration, and uncreative power use. She discovers the jaw clench technique and Instant Armor during training.

    Devonte and Akilah at Chambers & Woo Investigations confirm the Stheno USB contains approximately 200GB of encrypted pharmaceutical data. The street name for the black autoinjectors is Hypeman - expensive, exclusive, and mildly addictive. Mr. Retribution and Mrs. Quiet, Kingdom operatives, confront Sam about Soot's identity. Soot has caused approximately $80 million in Kingdom damages. Under duress at gunpoint, Sam agrees to a deal: a face-to-face with Kingdom upper management and two Hypeman samples, in exchange for Soot information. She feeds misleading details. The Kingdom demonstrates extensive knowledge of Sam's family.

    Kate takes Sam to her safehouse and implicitly confirms she is Soot. Kate confesses she is in love with Sam and is a lesbian tormented by Catholic guilt after a near-death experience during the house fire. Soot is partly rage outlet, partly penance - a "sin eater" philosophy. Sam does not reciprocate romantically but is supportive.

    Sam is driven to Manhattan to meet Mr. Antithesis - Kingdom upper management with amber eyes, clinical detachment, and obsessive hand sanitizer use. She feeds him a rehearsed mix of truth and lies about "Kate" and receives two Hypeman autoinjectors.

    The Auditors execute the Soot fake death operation at Lardner's Point Park. Sam wears Soot's costume while the team poses as a fake villain group called "the Washes." Kingdom operatives arrive including Mr. Polygraph, who interrogates Sam-as-Soot - Sam feeds rehearsed lies his detection confirms as "honest," proving Polygraph can be fooled. Mrs. Quiet shoots Sam three times. Lily hurls Sam into the Delaware River. Drowning, Sam injects Hypeman into her belly, triggering aggressive healing and uncontrollable tooth sprouting. Crossroads locates her approximately twenty minutes later. The Kingdom believes Soot is dead.

    Kate and Liam relocate to Center City under the new identity "Kay Smith." On their final night, Sam and Kate fight at their childhood basketball court. Kate reveals extensive martial arts training and wins with an aikido throw. Sam analyzes the decrypted Stheno data, confirming it is Hypeman manufacturing data with Stheno producing, Tremont & Fairfax covering, and Richardson protecting. Jordan departs for MIT. Sam's Hypeman withdrawal symptoms worsen - shaking, headaches, rapid heartbeat - though she attributes them to dehydration.

??? warning "Book 12: Authorized Personnel Only"

    **Role:** Main

    Three weeks after Kate's departure, Sam leads the Auditors alone with worsening Hypeman withdrawal. Amelia provides a new costume with self-repairing fabric and teeth-compatible weak points. On a night patrol, Tasha gives Sam a cigarette, discovering nicotine manages the withdrawal symptoms. Informant Darius Robinson tips them about a Sunoco station on Longshore Avenue.

    The Auditors raid the station, confirming Jump distribution. They encounter Marathon and Dead Drop (a ferrokinetic who chains Sam up), with Blink freeing Sam and Gossamer revealing a new bullwhip weapon. Rogue Wave hijacks NBC10 again, posting a recruitment scavenger hunt and later announcing free Jump samples citywide, sparking chaos.

    Sam meets Bulldozer at Patty's Bar to propose coordinating against Richardson. Patriot confronts Sam at a basketball court, unsettled but warning her off. Camilla de Leon arrives, revealing Richardson has threatened Rachel's library. Rachel decides to testify against the anti-vigilante bill in Harrisburg.

    Sam tracks Elias Franklin's Fly-altered blood trail to a warehouse where he is documenting Jump distribution for Rogue Wave. Rush Order ambushes Sam on South Street. The fight becomes a public spectacle; Sam reads Rush Order's "plant" tell and lands a headbutt. Ben Small arrives with a handgun. In the exchange of gunfire, Rush Order is hit in the shoulder and Ben in the thigh. "Gun Dad" goes viral. Rush Order later posts an HIRC video declaring Ben under Rogue Wave protection.

    During recovery, Amelia upgrades Sam's suit with a collapsible polymer helmet. Sam sneaks into Richardson's town hall and walks down the center aisle as Bloodhound, raising Duvall's suspicious death and the T-Rex attack. Rachel stands up and reveals herself as organizer of a coalition of parents with powered children. Richardson loses control of the room. Captain Devil confronts Sam, revealing invisible talons and acid blood. Sam sprays diluted pig blood to visualize the talons and flees. Maggie bodyslams Captain Devil with force fields; Sam escapes on Lily's scooter.

    ParentsOfPoweredKids.co.us launches and gains 20,000 signatures in hours, spreading to multiple states. Sam realizes Rachel planned for her to show up - the motion sensors were a trap to know when Sam left. Ben establishes punishment terms: library volunteering, tracker, and mandatory communication before patrols. Rachel tells Sam to coordinate their recklessness next time.

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam begins her junior year still serving her punishment - library volunteering, tracker bracelet, observation-only patrols. While digitizing the Morrison Collection (a 73-box archive of superhuman history), she discovers Liberty Belle's early career as "Breakout" and a "Daedalus Contractors" tab listing Pop-pop Moe's weatherproofing company. Belle had noted Sam's recruitment was not coincidental: "M. Small - not coincidence. Grandfather and granddaughter." Sam confronts Moe, who reveals the full scope of his Daedalus involvement and Belle's 2014 visits investigating the dismantling of rehabilitation programs.

    At the Harrisburg state senate hearings on SB-147, a Boston Commons explosion, protests in fourteen cities, and a Daedalus Correctional breach occur within twelve hours - clearly coordinated. Rachel delivers powerful testimony, and SB-147 fails 11-9. The Daedalus breach releases the "Magnificent Seven," including Niles Nolan (Shrike) - a serial killer who murdered five women using metal spike powers before Belle captured him. Shrike begins terrorizing NE Philadelphia, impaling birds in expanding neighborhoods. Sam identifies the pattern as matching the butcher bird and connects it to Shrike from Belle's notebooks.

    Victor Blanc, Sam's maternal grandfather - a 72-year-old long-haul trucker and self-identified sociopath - arrives unexpectedly, his visit arranged by the Kingdom as psychological warfare. He reveals troubling family history and suggests Sam get tested for autism and antisocial personality disorder, saying it "runs in families." Sam visits him secretly and learns the truth about the arranged visit.

    Shrike escalates: 36 mannequins impaled on spikes at a Kensington church, forming a deconstructed address puzzle. One labeled "The Genuine Hound" has raw meat to test for blood-sensing. Derek impersonates Bloodhound during the citywide manhunt while Sam coordinates from home. Sam detects a heartbeat in a barbed-wire-wrapped dumpster on Amber Street and chews through the wire with her teeth, sustaining severe mouth injuries, to rescue a trapped man.

    At 3:17 AM, Shrike breaks into Sam's home. He is explicitly antisemitic and neo-Nazi, targeting her Jewish heritage. After a standoff with Ben holding a gun, Shrike delivers an ultimatum: leave an invitation at the Metropolitan Opera House with a place and date, or he will impale everyone she knows. The Small family flees their home.

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Main

    The Smalls evacuate to the Music Hall after Shrike's home invasion. Sam cashes in Rush Order's public declaration of Rogue Wave protection for Ben. Monkey Business, Rush Order, and Birthday Suit arrive at the Music Hall for negotiations. Rachel impresses Monkey Business by catching him on juvenile contract voidability. The deal is sealed with a palm-tooth handshake. Critically, Rush Order whispers that Maya was not in Harrisburg during the hearings - whoever testified was not Maya. He knows via his homing ability.

    Sam leaves an invitation at the Metropolitan Opera House specifying the Van Kirk and James construction site. The confrontation becomes a public spectacle after Shrike sends press releases. Sam engages Shrike in a deadly spike field, learning to shuffle and skid to avoid ground-level impalement. DVDs arrive as backup. After police move in to cuff him, a gunshot from skinheads triggers chaos. Shrike breaks free, takes Hypeman, and begins Round 2. He pins Sam with a cabinet rail across her throat. Full-body Instant Armor erupts for the first time. Sam enters a berserker state - no language, only primal combat instinct. She bites through Shrike's forearm, tears herself free, and finishes him with a clothesline to the temple. Both go down.

    Sam is hospitalized with multiple lacerations, puncture wounds, severe calf damage requiring an external fixator, tracheal trauma, and a fractured metacarpal. The abdominal wound would have been fatal without surgery. Shrike dies approximately one hour later. That evening, Sam tells her parents: "I don't think I want to be Bloodhound anymore." Rachel cries from relief.

    A one-month timeskip follows. Sam heals at home with a medical boot. Derek starts the Vysera drug trial. Davis visits with blueprints to convert the Music Hall into a community center. Sam begins an EMT internship at Station 37. Family therapy with Dr. Kaplan explores generational trauma from Leah Small to Sam. Maggie confronts Sam about secretly researching Kingdom operations: "You're not retired, Sam. You're pretending to be retired."

    Sam begins the peer mentorship program with Zara Khan, Liam O'Connor, Alex Kirby, and Jasmine Walker. During an EMT shift, a riot erupts between the Community Watch and the anti-powered Songbirds. Sam injects a seizing Jumphead with midazolam despite electrical discharge; her heart stops for 23 seconds before Deena revives her. Bulwark reveals the Kingdom is intercepting and tainting Rogue Wave Jump shipments as a gang war tactic.

    Sam and Tasha investigate Councilman Silverstein, discovering he is fast-tracking liquor licenses for Kingdom fronts and receiving donations from the same shell companies owning Kingdom properties. Nina de la Cruz confirms seeing Richardson and Silverstein meeting with politicians at the Crescent. The Kingdom sends Garbage Day to the Music Hall, who destroys their computers and deliberately dislocates Tasha's shoulder. Sam notices Tasha's self-harm scars for the first time. Tasha plants a BugTag tracker in Garbage Day's jacket. Jordan's backup sync preserves the data - the Silverstein connection remains secret.

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Main

    Sam texts the BugTag tracker data to Rush Order, fulfilling her Rogue Wave debt. The resulting Roxborough Memorial confrontation produces nineteen arrests including Mr. Polygraph. Monkey Business texts that the debt is paid.

    Sam is ambushed by Patriot and Turbo Jett with an arrest warrant citing twelve incidents over six weeks. She realizes someone has been impersonating her as Bloodhound - a third person entirely. She runs, using blood sense as parkour guidance, and finds Miasma in an alley. Miasma reveals he is a mole inside Argus Corps, secretly working against the Kingdom since the team's formation.

    Sam goes underground for eleven days, rotating through Miasma's safehouses and conducting systematic Kingdom raids. She uses polarized goggles, burner phones, and improves her lockpicking. Crossroads texts target assessments. On Day 7, she pickpockets Silverstein during surveillance. On Day 8, she visits Kate in Center City, who forces Sam to sleep ten hours while she stands guard. Sam uploads approximately three hundred photos of Kingdom financial records to Jordan, who feeds them to CapeWatch Philly and the Inquirer.

    On Day 11, Sam confronts the shapeshifter at Maya's residence - the impersonator wearing Sam's face perfectly, countering tooth demonstrations with prosthetics. Sam punches her to prove two bodies exist and is arrested. Gerald Caldwell secures release with an ankle monitor. Crossroads arrives injured - Mrs. Heartbeat caught him, stabbing and shooting him. He reveals his real name is Maxwell Martinez.

    Confined by the ankle monitor, Sam returns to routine while Maxwell tracks Kingdom expansion from the Smalls' couch. Ben corrects the model from radial to infrastructure-based. A targeted blizzard hits NE Philadelphia - sixteen inches in six hours - enabling overnight break-ins across Kingdom territory. Alex Kirby arrives with unauthorized reconnaissance, then barely survives fighting Garbage Day at a warehouse. Sam benches him: "I'm not Belle. I'm not going to do to you what she did to me."

    After the ankle monitor is removed, Sam and Amelia suit up as "Remora" and "Stingray" to confront the shapeshifter (Elena Morales) at a constituent outreach event. Amelia engages Patriot with whips while Sam herds civilians. Miasma drives off with Elena in custody. At a Fishtown safehouse, Miasma obtains a recorded confession. The key admission - that Elena is not Maya - burns Maya's alibi machine.

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Main

    The Tacony Community Center opens the same morning Elena's confession hits the news. Sam receives keys as associate program coordinator. Agent Ford of the FBI establishes Sam as an off-the-books evidence channel, revealing the FBI has been tracking NE Philadelphia activity for months and a grand jury is being convened.

    Sam investigates the tainted Jump crisis through her EMT work. Her blood-tasting identifies the adulterant as a stimulant from the methylphenidate family - she recognizes it as Concerta because she takes it herself. She maps geographic clustering, stakes out distribution points, and traces the supply chain to the Bellwether District. Marathon, a Rogue Wave operative, appears at Bellwether with a backpack of explosives; Sam talks him into joint reconnaissance instead of demolition.

    A Songbird bounty hunter attacks Sam on the street with a photo targeting Sam Small specifically, not Bloodhound. This triggers a breakdown: "All 'retired' means is I'm doing it alone, without backup, without telling anyone. It means I'm doing it worse." She asks her parents to schedule therapy with Dr. Desai.

    Maxwell departs after three months on the Smalls' couch, helping Sam prepare for the FBI call using coin-flip precognition. Sam provides Bellwether details to Ford, establishing FBI jurisdiction. A federal raid produces sixteen detentions and drug and weapons charges for the Kingdom. Explosive devices in the basement are Marathon's work, which Sam tells nobody.

    Sam begins therapy voluntarily for the first time, telling Desai she is "going to actually tell you stuff." The central insight: "I've been treating my life like a sprint. I need help figuring out how to pace myself." The "load-bearing life" concept emerges - stepping back would cause everything to collapse.

    Sam adopts the Miss Megalodon identity. Amelia's new suit is blue and white with tension-hardening knuckles, tooth seams, a right forearm gauntlet (pepper spray, smoke, pig's blood solution), and a polymer shark-shaped helmet with a voice modulator. Her first outing stops a Kingdom false-flag robbery at Donovan's Hardware. Her parents negotiate patrol terms: planned route, home by ten, text updates.

    Jennifer Patterson sees through Sam immediately and challenges her on long-term sustainability. Sam deliberately takes a public beating from four Songbirds on Torresdale Avenue, controlling the narrative with bystander video, a police statement, and a walk to the community center visibly injured. The video goes viral.

    Mr. Nothing intercepts Sam on the Broad Street Line heading to meet Maya, threatening her with a screwdriver and demonstrating the Kingdom's reach. Patriot appears on the platform and escorts Sam to Maya's office after presenting Nothing with a choice - he picks freedom. Sam pickpockets the screwdriver.

    The meeting with Maya is the arc's climax. Sam delivers a three-doors speech: the Kingdom goes away, stalemate while the feds close in, or kill Sam and activate everyone on her thirteen-name list. She holds Nothing's screwdriver to her own neck: "I'm willing to blade myself for cheap heat." Maya blasts Sam into the door with barokinesis, tries to redirect her toward Porcelain and the Daedalus breakout, and when Sam refuses: "Get the fuck out of my office."

    In the aftermath, Maya loses Argus Corps oversight through a Davis-led council coalition. Turbo Jett confronts Maya about Duvall's autopsy showing decompression injuries. Maya deploys barokinesis at six to seven atmospheres; Jett walks through it. Maya manipulates Jett with selective truth, admitting to killing Duvall and revealing her daughter Roxy is held hostage. Maya ultimately chooses EXIT, resigning from City Council.

## Trivia

- She has been described as "probably the strongest seventeen-year-old girl on the planet" in baseline human capability terms.
- Sam does not read comics, a detail revealed when Alex Kirby made a Peter Parker comparison.
- Sam's birthday is April 16. She celebrated her fifteenth birthday in the hospital during Arc 4.5 and turned sixteen during Arc 10.
- She frames her identity shift from Bloodhound to Megalodon as a mathematical piecewise function - different functions on the same domain, representing a discontinuity rather than a contradiction.
- She initially considered "Shark-girl" as a hero name in Chapter 2 and dismissed it immediately. Her initial reaction to her own powers was that they were "shitty" and mostly gross.
- The Tacony Community Center was partly made possible by the Garbage Day attack on the Music Hall, which triggered insurance, emergency city funds, and historical preservation funding that Davis leveraged for the renovation.
- Sam keeps her JLUMA in her phone case.
- The Small family observes Shabbat dinner at Pop-pop Moe's house in Ventnor, New Jersey.
