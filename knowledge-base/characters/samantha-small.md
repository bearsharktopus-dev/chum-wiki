## Background

Samantha Small was a fourteen-year-old Jewish girl living in Mayfair, Philadelphia when a boating accident in August 2023 triggered her Activation Event, granting her a suite of shark-derived metahuman abilities including enhanced bite force, blood-sensing, accelerated regeneration, and the capacity to grow teeth from any part of her body. The accident occurred on Pop-Pop Moe's boat; during the event, Sam transformed into what Morris later described as a "snarling beast of the sea, like an angry marlin," destroying the boat's engine. Sam has no memory of the transformation itself. Sam was subsequently registered through the JLUMA (Juvenile Licensed Use of Metahuman Abilities) system, which brought her to the attention of Diane Williams, the veteran superhero Liberty Belle, who recruited Sam into the Young Defenders program and became her first mentor.

Sam's early career as the vigilante Bloodhound was defined by a rapid and brutal education in the realities of superhuman conflict in Philadelphia. Within her first year of activity, she witnessed a murder committed by the Kingdom of Keys criminal organization, had her family home destroyed by Mr. T-Rex, was tortured by the pyrokinetic Aaron McKinley (who removed her fingernails), watched Liberty Belle die in her arms after a confrontation with Chernobyl, and fell into a radiation-induced coma after pursuing Chernobyl alone into the subway tunnels beneath Philadelphia. She was hospitalized for weeks during Arc 4.5, during which she was formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, ADHD, and autism, and began treatment with lithium and other medications. She also discovered during this period that her mother Rachel's maiden name was Blanc and that she had Hispanic heritage through her maternal grandmother Camilla, whom she met for the first time.

Following her hospitalization, Sam's approach to vigilantism evolved from impulsive direct action toward strategic leadership. She co-founded the Auditors with Jordan Westwood, an independent investigation team operating out of the Tacony Music Hall, dedicated to exposing and dismantling the Kingdom of Keys. Over the course of the next two years, Sam led the Auditors through an escalating series of conflicts involving the Kingdom, the power-drug distribution network Rogue Wave, the government-sanctioned Argus Corps, and multiple individual antagonists including the white supremacist Shrike and the returning Aaron McKinley. She navigated anti-vigilante legislation pushed by Councilwoman Maya Richardson, negotiated a protection arrangement with Rogue Wave to safeguard her family, and mentored a new generation of powered youth through a community center program established by Councilman Jamal Davis.

Sam retired the Bloodhound identity following a near-fatal confrontation with Niles Nolan (Shrike) in late September 2025, during which she manifested complete Instant Armor for the first time and killed Shrike in a dissociative episode. She passed the Bloodhound mantle to Derek Taylor, who became Bloodhound II. After months of attempted retirement spent working as an EMT intern and running the mentorship program at the Tacony Community Center, Sam acknowledged that she had never truly stopped doing vigilante work and adopted the new identity of Miss Megalodon in February 2026. As of the beginning of Arc 17, she operates in Mayfair under this new alias while continuing her roles as peer mentor, EMT trainee, and de facto intelligence coordinator for Philadelphia's independent hero community.

Sam is the daughter of Benjamin Small, a city planner, and Rachel Small (nee Blanc), a librarian. Her paternal grandfather Morris "Pop-pop Moe" Small is a retired engineer with historical connections to the construction of Daedalus Correctional Facility and to Liberty Belle. Her maternal grandfather Victor Blanc is an estranged, emotionally detached figure whose unexpected visit to Philadelphia revealed troubling parallels between his personality and Sam's own tendencies. She has no siblings. She stands five feet ten inches tall and has been described as having a broad-shouldered, wide-hipped, rectangular "powerlifter" build.

## Powers & Abilities

### PERKS Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Classification** | G4/B/C |
| **Category** | Gigant (primary), Brain (secondary), Create (tertiary) |
| **Power Ranking** | 4/10 |
| **Control** | 5/10 |
| **Hostility** | 6/10 |
| **Collateral Damage** | 2/10 |
| **Threat Level** | 5/10 |

Sam's powers are classified under three PERKS categories. Her primary classification is Gigant, reflecting her enhanced physical attributes (bite force, durability, regeneration). Her secondary classification is Brain, covering her blood-sensing abilities. Her tertiary classification is Create, reflecting her ability to generate teeth from her body. Her overall power ranking is relatively modest compared to heavy hitters like Captain Plasma, but her threat level is elevated by her tactical intelligence, pain tolerance, and willingness to sustain injuries that would incapacitate other combatants.

### Abilities

- **Enhanced Bite Force** — Sam possesses a bite force dramatically exceeding human norms, consistent with shark-derived physiology. She can bite through materials including flesh, bone, and some industrial materials. This is her most reliable offensive capability in close-quarters combat.
- **Blood Sense** — A sensory ability allowing Sam to detect and identify blood within a significant radius. She can sense the presence of blood on objects, identify whether a person is bleeding internally, detect drugs or foreign substances in a person's bloodstream, and assess injuries with diagnostic precision that has impressed medical professionals. This ability functions as her primary investigative and medical tool and is categorized under the Brain PERKS classification.
- **Accelerated Regeneration** — Sam heals from injuries at a dramatically accelerated rate compared to baseline humans. She has recovered from crushed tracheas, severe puncture wounds, extensive burns, broken bones, smoke inhalation, gunshot wounds, and cardiac arrest. Her regeneration requires high-calorie, high-protein nutritional support and is not instantaneous; severe injuries still require days to weeks of recovery. Dr. Song has noted that Sam's regeneration has produced "small benign tumors" alongside scar tissue and evidence of chronic organ damage from repeated severe trauma. Her regeneration philosophy is central to her approach to heroism: because she can heal from injuries that would permanently disable or kill others, she views absorbing damage and offering mercy as a moral obligation rather than recklessness.
- **Tooth Generation (Odontogenesis)** — Sam can grow teeth from any surface of her body. She discovered this ability during her torture by Aaron McKinley in Arc 4, when teeth grew from her gums and jaw in a stress response. She has since developed multiple tactical applications:
  - **Instant Armor** — Growing a layer of teeth across her knuckles, forearms, or other body parts to create improvised armor and weapon surfaces. During the Shrike confrontation, she manifested complete Instant Armor covering her entire body for the first time, though this triggered a claustrophobic response and dissociative episode due to its similarity to her initial Activation Event (being trapped underwater).
  - **Blading** — Growing a single tooth through her forearm and using it as a concealed cutting implement, useful for misdirection and feigning injury.
  - **Tooth-Knuckles** — Growing teeth from her knuckles to enhance striking damage, her most commonly used offensive application of the ability.
  - **Biting Surfaces** — Growing teeth on forearms and other contact points during grappling to tear at opponents.
- **Enhanced Durability** — While not invulnerable, Sam demonstrates physical toughness exceeding baseline humans. Her jaw can absorb punches with minimal effect (a reflexive lockjaw response), and she has sustained extraordinary cumulative damage across her career without permanent disability, though Dr. Song has warned of possible long-term consequences.
- **Equilibrium State** — Sam discovered during her fugitive operations in Arc 15 that she can sustain physical activity indefinitely once reaching an equilibrium between exertion and her regenerative capabilities, allowing extended operations without the normal fatigue experienced by baseline humans.

### Limitations

- Sam's regeneration is not instantaneous and severe injuries require significant recovery time; a crushed trachea, severe puncture wounds, and leg damage from the Shrike fight required weeks to months of recovery with medical intervention including external fixators and biopolymer scaffolding.
- Her regeneration may have long-term health consequences; Dr. Song has noted small benign tumors, chronic organ damage, and extensive scar tissue, and has warned that regeneration might accelerate cancer rather than prevent it.
- The complete Instant Armor covering her full body triggers claustrophobia rooted in her original Activation Event (drowning), causing dissociative episodes and loss of conscious control.
- Tooth generation requires significant physical effort, which Sam has described as extremely strenuous.
- She experienced withdrawal symptoms (headaches, tremors, uncontrollable shaking) after using Hypeman, a power-enhancing drug she injected to survive being shot multiple times during the Soot deception operation in Arc 11. Cigarettes partially alleviated these symptoms, and she subsequently struggled with nicotine use.
- Her blood sense, while powerful, can be overwhelming in environments with large amounts of blood or many injured individuals.
- She is a baseline-weight human in terms of mass and can be physically overpowered by opponents with superior strength, size, or weaponry despite her regeneration.
- Sam takes lithium, Concerta (methylphenidate), Zofran (as needed), Prazosin, and Desvenlafaxine for her bipolar disorder, ADHD, and PTSD. Disruption of her medication regimen affects her cognitive function and emotional regulation.

### Training & Skills

- **Boxing** — Sam's primary martial art, trained extensively by Multiplex (Elijah Brooks) of the Delaware Valley Defenders. She progressed from fundamentals to advanced techniques over the course of multiple training arcs and now teaches boxing to her teammates and mentees.
- **Aikido** — Supplementary martial arts training.
- **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu** — Supplementary grappling training.
- **Dirty Fighting** — Sam fights pragmatically and without adherence to any code of honor in combat. She uses deception, environmental manipulation, and psychological tactics freely.
- **Emergency Medical Training** — Sam works as an EMT intern and has demonstrated diagnostic abilities that impressed hospital residents, combining her blood sense with formal medical knowledge to identify internal injuries without imaging equipment.
- **Investigative Skills** — Inherited Liberty Belle's detective files and equipment, and developed her own investigative methodology combining surveillance, informant networks, and strategic intelligence distribution. Capable of lockpicking (improved from 40 seconds to 18 seconds during her fugitive operations), undercover work, and evidence documentation.
- **Strategic Leadership** — Evolved from impulsive field operative to team leader and intelligence coordinator. Coordinates multiple vigilante teams (Auditors, Tacony Titans, Pattinson's Pals) and institutional allies (DVD, FBI, Councilman Davis) as an information hub.
- **Territorial Mapping** — Studies city planning maps, sewer plans, and infrastructure overlays to memorize patrol routes, sight lines, choke points, and escape routes throughout Mayfair and Tacony.
- **PR and Media Strategy** — Developed an understanding of public relations warfare, deliberately using media coverage and official records (FOIA-able police reports, bystander video) as weapons against opponents. Notably allowed herself to be beaten by Songbird operatives to generate sympathetic public footage.
- **Peer Mentorship** — Runs training sessions for powered youth, teaching power control exercises, grounding techniques, safety protocols, and de-escalation strategies.

## Personality

Sam is energetic, self-deprecating, and impulsive, with a moral compass that bends but does not break under extraordinary pressure. Her narration features stream-of-consciousness thoughts, parenthetical asides, and a distinctive blend of teenage vernacular with unexpectedly sharp observations. She possesses what has been described as an overwhelming "truth drive," a compulsive need to uncover and expose concealed information that she articulates through the phrase "if it can be destroyed by the truth it deserves to be destroyed by the truth," though she lacks the political sophistication to fully appreciate the complexity of that principle. She is deeply funny in a self-lacerating way, frequently undercutting moments of genuine heroism or vulnerability with dark humor. In combat, she uses humor as a deliberate weapon, not in the vein of lighthearted quipping, but as targeted bullying designed to make opponents angry and sloppy.

Beneath the wisecracking exterior, Sam carries the accumulated weight of extraordinary trauma for someone her age. By seventeen, she has been tortured, burned alive, shot multiple times, set on fire, arrested, made a fugitive, and killed a man. She has watched her mentor die in her arms, had her home destroyed, suffered cardiac arrest, and been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, ADHD, and autism. Her relationship with danger is paradoxical: she is not suicidal, but she is an adrenaline junkie whose overwhelming lust for life (what might be termed an overwhelming Eros) manifests as seemingly self-destructive behavior. She gravitates toward bad situations for the physiological rush of surviving them. Her regeneration enables and reinforces this pattern; because she heals from injuries that would permanently disable others, she treats her body as expendable in service of protecting people who cannot recover as she can. Her core philosophical position is that regeneration creates an ethical obligation to absorb harm on behalf of others and to offer mercy repeatedly, even when it does not work, because most people only get to make the mistake of showing mercy to the wrong person once.

Sam's mental health is a persistent thread throughout the narrative. Her bipolar disorder manifests in identifiable patterns that she has learned to self-monitor, including flagging potential hypomanic episodes and questioning whether her elevated mood is genuine or symptomatic. She takes her medication consistently and has voluntarily requested therapy on multiple occasions, including asking her parents to schedule sessions with Dr. Desai after recognizing her own deteriorating mental state. She experiences dissociative episodes, hypervigilance, stress-related hair-pulling, and difficulty sleeping. Her ADHD contributes to her stream-of-consciousness processing style, and her autism manifests in her intense focus, pattern recognition, and occasional difficulty with social conventions. She uses cigarettes to manage what she initially attributed to stress but later understood as Hypeman withdrawal symptoms, though her mother established strict conditions around this habit after revealing that Sam's maternal grandmother died of lung cancer.

Sam's relationships are defined by fierce protectiveness and an inability to delegate risk. She struggles profoundly with allowing others to face danger on her behalf, a pattern rooted in the self-reliance philosophy she inherited from her father (who inherited it from Pop-pop Moe, who inherited it from his Holocaust-survivor wife Leah). Family therapy with Dr. Kaplan identified that Sam's vigilantism and her father's gun ownership both stem from the same philosophical conviction that institutional systems cannot be trusted to protect the people you love. Multiple authority figures and peers have confronted Sam about her self-sacrificial tendencies, including Maggie (who delivered an ultimatum demanding Sam operate as strategist rather than lone field operative), Mrs. Patterson (who challenged her to build a sustainable career rather than burning out by twenty-five), and Maxwell (who observed that Sam's "retirement" simply meant doing the same work alone, without backup, and worse). The turning point came in Book 16 when Sam had a breakdown in a Faraday cage during a therapy session, confronting the reality that her "retirement" was a fiction. Maxwell's diagnosis — that Sam had built a "load-bearing life" where stepping back would cause everything to collapse — prompted her to seek a sustainable model rather than oscillating between burnout and compulsion. Sam's gradual acceptance that she cannot personally be present for every crisis, and that systems she builds can function without her, represents one of the central arcs of her character development.

## Relationships

Sam has systematically worked to expose Richardson's corruption through investigative journalism, political coalition-building, and covert operations. |
| Maxwell Martinez (Crossroads) | Ally / Advisor | Young adult DVD member with precognitive abilities who serves as Sam's Socratic-method therapist and strategic advisor. Recovering from an assassination attempt by Mrs. Heartbeat, he has been living in the Small family home while providing dispatching and intelligence support. |
| Jamal Davis | Political Ally | City Councilman who proposed converting the Tacony Music Hall into a community center and established the powered youth mentorship program that Sam leads. Provides political cover, resources, and institutional legitimacy for Sam's activities. |
| Lawrence Sullivan (Monkey Business) | Complicated | Rogue Wave leader with supernatural contract-binding abilities. Sam negotiated a protection arrangement with him to safeguard her family from Shrike, sealed by mixing their blood. She subsequently fulfilled the debt by tipping off Rogue Wave about Kingdom operations. |
| Joshua Pleasants (Miasma) | Secret Ally | A mole within Argus Corps and former ally of Liberty Belle who provided Sam with safehouses during her fugitive period and helped orchestrate the capture of Elena Morales. His relationship with Sam echoes and contrasts his earlier relationship with Belle. |
| Alex Kirby (Hellhound) | Mentee | Sixteen-year-old with pyrogenesis, one of four initial mentorship program students. Romantically interested in Sam (rejected gracefully on Valentine's Day). Conducted an unauthorized solo raid on a Kingdom warehouse against Sam's wishes, reflecting Sam's own tendency toward unilateral action. Now training parkour with Sam weekly. |

The Daedalus prison break releases approximately fifty prisoners, including Shrike. Sam's maternal grandfather Victor Blanc arrives in Philadelphia, arranged by the Kingdom as psychological warfare. Shrike begins hunting Sam with explicitly anti-Semitic motivations, escalating from dead birds to a home invasion. Rachel's coalition defeats Richardson's anti-vigilante legislation at the state senate 11-9. The Kingdom is revealed to be subordinate to the international mercenary group Red Calf, led by Porcelain. The arc concludes with the Small family fleeing their home. |
| Book 14: Shelter in Place | Main | Sam negotiates a protection arrangement with Rogue Wave through Derek's connection to Elias, sealed by mixing blood with Monkey Business. She discovers Shrike is using the Metropolitan Opera House as his base and sets up a confrontation at the Van Kirk construction site. The battle with Shrike and his skinhead followers proves nearly lethal. Sam manifests complete Instant Armor for the first time, experiences a dissociative episode, and kills Shrike. She is hospitalized with a crushed trachea, severe puncture wounds, and leg damage requiring an external fixator. Sam retires the Bloodhound identity and passes it to Derek. Councilman Davis proposes converting the Music Hall into a community center. Sam begins the peer mentorship program with Zara Khan, Liam O'Connor, Alex Kirby, and Jasmine Walker. She experiences cardiac arrest for 23 seconds during a Jumphead incident while working as an EMT. The Kingdom attacks the Music Hall through the enforcer Garbage Day, injuring Tasha, but Tasha plants a tracker on the attacker. |
| Book 15: Severe Weather Warning | Main | Sam tips off Rogue Wave about Kingdom evidence disposal, fulfilling her debt and resulting in nineteen arrests including Mr. Polygraph. Richardson retaliates by deploying the shapeshifter Elena Morales to impersonate Sam as Bloodhound, generating an arrest warrant. Sam goes underground as a fugitive, conducting eleven days of systematic raids against Kingdom operations with Crossroads providing intelligence. She compiles evidence and feeds it to the Philadelphia Inquirer and CapeWatch Philly. She confronts Elena at Maya's address, proving two physical bodies exist simultaneously. Gerald Caldwell secures Sam's release with an ankle monitor. Maya uses weather manipulation to generate a targeted blizzard facilitating Kingdom break-ins. Sam and Amelia, disguised as "Remora" and "Stingray," capture Elena Morales during a constituent outreach event, obtaining a recorded confession that breaks Maya's alibi machine. |
| Book 16: Category Five Hurricane | Main | The Tacony Community Center officially opens as Elena's confession hits the news. Sam attends the grand opening wearing the Bloodhound costume symbolically. She receives keys to the center as associate program coordinator. Agent Ford of the FBI establishes Sam as an off-the-books evidence channel. Sam investigates the tainted Jump crisis, mapping the supply chain from street dealers through an auto body shop to a Bellwether District industrial cutting operation. She forms a reluctant alliance with Marathon for joint reconnaissance. She is attacked by a Songbird bounty hunter, realizes her retirement is unsustainable, and adopts the Miss Megalodon identity. She stops a Kingdom false-flag robbery at Donovan's Hardware in her first outing. She deliberately takes a public beating from Songbird operatives for its PR value, generating bystander video evidence while building an official police paper trail. |

## Trivia

- Sam's Activation Event was a near-drowning incident during a boating accident, which is why her complete Instant Armor triggers claustrophobia -- the sensation of being fully enclosed mirrors the feeling of being trapped underwater.
- She has been described as "probably the strongest seventeen-year-old girl on the planet" in baseline human capability terms, possessing a powerlifter build with broad shoulders and wide hips at five feet ten inches.
- Sam does not read comics, a detail revealed when Alex Kirby made a Peter Parker comparison and she responded that she does not read comics.
- Her medication regimen includes lithium, Concerta (methylphenidate), Zofran (as needed), Prazosin, and Desvenlafaxine. She recognized the stimulant adulterant in tainted Jump as Concerta because she takes it herself.
- Sam's birthday is April 16. She celebrated her fifteenth birthday in the hospital during Arc 4.5 and turned sixteen during Arc 10.
- The name "Megalodon" was chosen independently by Sam and first spoken aloud to a civilian (Mr. Donovan) during her first outing stopping a false-flag robbery. Her Megalodon costume is blue and white with a shark-shaped polymer helmet featuring a permanent slight grin and a voice modulator that produces a flat, mechanical, almost masculine sound.
- Sam frames her identity shift from Bloodhound to Megalodon as a mathematical piecewise function -- different functions on the same domain, representing a discontinuity rather than a contradiction.
- She is Jewish on her father's side (Ashkenazi) and Hispanic on her mother's side (through the Blanc family), though she did not learn about her Hispanic heritage until meeting her grandmother Camilla during Arc 4.5.
- Sam has killed exactly one person: Niles Nolan (Shrike), during a dissociative episode in which she lost conscious control. Shrike died approximately one hour after being hospitalized.
- Her approach to mercy is philosophically grounded in her regeneration: because she can survive mistakes that would kill others, she believes she has an obligation to offer mercy repeatedly, even to those who have proven they do not deserve it.
- Sam uses a "truth drive" philosophy she cannot fully articulate: "if it can be destroyed by the truth it deserves to be destroyed by the truth."
- The Tacony Community Center was made possible in part because the Garbage Day attack on the Music Hall triggered historical preservation funding that Councilman Davis redirected toward renovation.
- Multiple characters have noted that Sam is more transparent than she believes herself to be; both Mrs. Patterson and Maxwell Martinez have seen through her strategic calculations in real time.
- Sam's self-reliance philosophy was traced through four generations of her family in therapy: from Holocaust survivor Leah Small to Pop-pop Moe to Benjamin Small to Sam herself.
- She initially considered "Shark-girl" as a hero name in Chapter 2 and dismissed it immediately. Her initial reaction to her own powers was that they were "shitty" and mostly gross.
- Sam keeps her JLUMA in her phone case.
- The Small family observes Shabbat dinner at Pop-pop Moe's house in Ventnor, New Jersey.
