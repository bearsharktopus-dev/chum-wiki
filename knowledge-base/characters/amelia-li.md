## Background

Amelia Li is a fourth-generation Chinese-American from a large family in Chinatown, Philadelphia. Her Brain-type power grants an extraordinary intuitive understanding of textiles, weaving, and material science. Her parents have never fully accepted her superhero activities, a persistent tension that underlies her compulsive people-pleasing.

Approved for a JLUMA due to negligible collateral damage potential, she joined the Young Defenders as costumier and field medic, adopting the codename Gossamer on a friend's recommendation. She also contributed to the adult Delaware Valley Defenders. Her JLUMA was upgraded to a full LUMA in 2023.

After SARA dissolved the Young Defenders, Amelia briefly considered retiring but reversed course and joined the Auditors as quartermaster and equipment specialist. She has since developed an internship in "support devices" expected to become full-time after school.

| **Threat Level** | 1/10 |

### Abilities

- **Intuitive Textile Understanding** - Possesses an innate, intuitive grasp of textiles, weaving, tailoring, and material science as it relates to fabric and clothing. This understanding is experiential and intuitive rather than theoretical; she cannot explain or teach the underlying principles to others.
- **Anomalous Muscle Memory** - Her power provides exceptional muscle memory for complex textile-related tasks. She can perform intricate work without conscious planning or visual aid, and her muscle memory functions equally through any medium (needle and thread, sewing machine, or other tools) as long as at least one hand is on one of the objects being manipulated.
- **Structural Analysis (Textile-Analogous)** - Her understanding extends to structures that behave like textiles or can be conceived of as thread-related or strands under tension, including ropes, steel cables, nets, sails, knots, suspension bridges, and bullwhips. She can assess load-bearing structures and identify structural weak points.
- **Medical Application** - Can perform complex medical tasks analogous to weaving or tailoring, such as suturing wounds and tying tourniquets, with minimal instruction.
- **Anomalous Textile Creation** - Has developed the ability to create textiles with properties that defy conventional material science, including self-repairing fabrics, tension-hardening materials, fabrics that actively circulate air, and materials with designated weak points for tactical purposes. She does not fully understand how she produces these effects.
- **Whip Mastery** - Has secretly trained herself to use bullwhips with remarkable precision, leveraging her intuitive understanding of structures under tension. She possesses four distinct anomalous whips: a sparking whip with metal tips and LED-strip luminescence that produces enormous cracking sounds with orange sparks and white light; a hurting whip that is thin and narrow like a sword blade for primary combat; a grabbing whip that is flat and stumpy, able to curl, coil, and grab objects at a distance; and a climbing whip called the Line, made of leather that goes rigid when pulled, used for rappelling and ascending structures.

### Limitations

- **Material Scope** - Her powers apply only to threads, ropes, steel cables, fabrics, clothes, nets, sails, knots, and structures behaving like textiles. Rigid materials such as concrete, non-textile metals, plastics, glass, and electronic components are entirely outside her scope.
- **Contact Required** - Physical contact or proximity to the material is necessary for her power to manifest effectively. She has limited capability in understanding patterns or structures through indirect means such as pictures or videos.
- **Non-Combative Origin** - Her powers are not inherently offensive or defensive. Her combat effectiveness depends on equipment she has prepared in advance, particularly her whips and custom gear.
- **Inexplicable Mechanisms** - She cannot explain how she creates her anomalous textiles, which limits her ability to replicate or teach her techniques. Her creations have been described as "microscope breakers" because their properties defy analysis.

### Training & Skills

- First aid and field medicine: bandaging, suturing, CPR. Served as the Young Defenders' designated field medic and trained teammates at Crossroads' direction.
- Skilled boxer with expert-level technique and balletic footwork. Serves as Sam's primary boxing trainer; also taught Sam gymnastics.
- Notable costume creations include the original Bloodhound, Remora, Stingray, Bloodhound II, and Miss Megalodon suits.
- Teaches breathing exercises and meditation to teammates.

## Personality

Amelia is methodical, detail-oriented, and somewhat maternal toward younger teammates. She speaks with authority on technical matters but harbors vulnerability about the perceived inadequacy of her powers, questioning what value "super-tailoring" holds in a superhero context. Compulsively people-pleasing - a trait PERKS officers noted from her first assessment and one rooted in her parents' disapproval.

She has grown increasingly confident with the Auditors, taking on field roles and asking pointed questions when the moment demands it. Demonstrates strong analytical thinking and, despite her agreeable exterior, possesses sharp humor - Sam describes her smiles as "as cutting as her scissors."

??? warning "Book 11: Alarm Will Sound"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Gives Sam a new costume with self-repairing fabric that has strategic weak points for teeth, upgraded body armor, and a hidden forearm pocket. The materials are described as "microscope breakers" (Ch. 179). Conducts drive-by surveillance of the Sunoco station on her moped, taking polaroid photos for the team's investigation whiteboard (Ch. 180).

??? warning "Book 13: Burn After Reading"

    **Role:** Major Supporting

    Plays "Brainwash" during the staged confrontation at Lardner's Point Park, wearing a purple and gray costume with a black and white spiral mask equipped with a voice changer. The Brainwash persona is presented as having mind control but actually uses subtle telekinesis to control bodies via voice commands. Commands Kingdom operatives to stop during the confrontation (partially effective). Mrs. Quiet sees through the deception, noticing that a jacket fluttered backward - indicating physical force rather than mental control. Mr. Retribution rag-dolls Brainwash, cracking the mask and briefly exposing Amelia's face. The operation successfully fakes Soot's death, with Sam shot and thrown into the Delaware River as planned (though the severity of the injuries exceeded expectations).

??? warning "Book 14: Shelter in Place"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Arrives at the Music Hall emergency meeting after Shrike's home invasion, with scooter helmet in hand, alongside Lily. Pragmatically asks about the timeline: "Like what? Days? Weeks? Months?"

Accompanies Sam and Maggie on the covert mission to the Metropolitan Opera House to investigate Shrike. Takes the worst chemical exposure from rooftop aerosol traps (industrial cleaner mixed with pepper spray), dropping to her knees while Maggie uses forcefields to protect her face. Wears a domino eyepiece and N-95 mask for subsequent operations (Ch. 207). Positioned on her scooter circling the perimeter during the Van Kirk construction site confrontation with Shrike, serving as extraction, but unable to get through the spike barricade (Ch. 207-208). Fixes Sam's costume in the hospital after the Shrike fight while Sam recovers from surgery (Ch. 209). Finishes costume repairs and handles Music Hall cleanup while Sam recovers, confirmed by Lily's visit (Ch. 210).

??? warning "Book 15: Severe Weather Warning"

    **Role:** Major Supporting

    Arrives with a duffel bag of fabric samples and takes Sam's measurements for a new costume. Designs the base layer with self-repairing seams - strategic weak points that tear cleanly for teeth then stitch themselves back together (works four out of five times; the fifth caught fire, which she "mostly" fixed). Adds an outer layer of store-bought armor plates and guards with quick-release clasps, and samegawa (shark skin leather) on palms, knuckle backs, forearm sheets, and boot tops for extra grip. Mentions her internship in "support devices" and notes that consumer-available bulletproof vests "open a lot of doors, supply-line side" (Ch. 225). Operates with Lily and Maggie in Bridesburg during the blizzard, stopping two attempted break-ins - the team notes that "Amelia's whip is REALLY good" (Ch. 229-230). Designs both the Remora suit (deep water dark with black and white stripes, pink accents, domino mask, jaw/throat guard, voice modulator) for Sam and the Stingray suit (countershaded white and blue-grey, black fur lining, full-face smooth pointed mask with reflective eye lenses) for herself. Arrives soaked at Sam's house with both kits plus extras, having passed three cars in ditches on the way (Ch. 229). As Stingray, uses her sparking whip to scatter Kingdom soldiers on the streets, intimidating them with enormous cracking sounds and orange sparks. During the confrontation with Argus Corps at Alice-as-Maya's constituent event, engages Patriot directly - he catches her whip, grabs her ankle below the padding, and tries to twist it. She retrieves her lost whips with the grabbing whip, then cracks the sparking whip across Patriot's face, leaving a constellation of flint and metal cuts on his jawline. Escapes with a badly sprained ankle, using her climbing whip (Line) to ascend a fire escape one-handed with her bad ankle hooked around the rope (Ch. 229-230). Provides Derek with a completed Bloodhound costume - resized for his six-foot-something male build, with winter and summer variations and kevlar where it matters - behind a Northeast Philly high school on Halloween morning (Ch. 232 interlude). Asks Sam the pointed question during a team meeting: "You're treating yourself like a messenger" - calling out Sam's refusal to act as a leader. Sam asks to talk to Amelia privately afterward about getting a new costume (Ch. 238). Sends Sam a package that arrives on the porch in brown cardboard with Amelia's handwriting and no return address, containing what becomes the Miss Megalodon suit (Ch. 238).

??? warning "Book 16: Category Five Hurricane"

    **Role:** Supporting

    Sam wears a Bloodhound costume that Amelia repaired (described as a "Frankenstein version") for the community center grand opening (Ch. 233). Sam gives Amelia the Bloodhound helmet for "archival" (Ch. 235). Sam opens Amelia's package at 11:04 PM - the Miss Megalodon suit: blue and white, recycled from the Remora suit, with lighter fabric, padded construction, tension-hardening knuckles with tooth seams at joints, a gauntlet on the right forearm (pepper spray, smoke, pig's blood tracking solution), a belt with first aid kit, two emergency drones folded flat, and zip ties, and a polymer printed shark-shaped helmet with a slight permanent grin and voice modulator (Ch. 239). Sam notes that heat-dispersing gloves for Alex Kirby would be a future project for Amelia (Ch. 240).
