## Overview

The Daedalus Prison Break was a coordinated assault on the nation's first purpose-built superhuman prison on September 10, 2025. Porcelain - widely described as "the strongest superhuman on Earth" and leader of Red Calf - blackmailed Maya Richardson into forcing the Kingdom of Keys' compliance. The primary objective was extracting Daisy Zhen, a 13-year-old power copier.

The operation breached the facility but failed to secure its target: Deathgirl woke prematurely, copied three powers simultaneously (Mudslide's liquefaction, Vector's telekinesis, Synapse's nerve manipulation), and escaped into the prison's lower tunnels. She eventually reached Albany and reunited with her parents. Among the approximately fifty escapees, Niles Nolan / Shrike subsequently launched a sustained campaign of terror against Sam Small across northeast Philadelphia.

## Background

Porcelain's connection to Daedalus predated the facility's completion. During construction in 2006, an Israeli military consultant named "Chezki Espinosa" observed containment testing and praised contractor Morris "Pop-pop Moe" Small of Horvath-Small Ltd. Liberty Belle later investigated the facility and identified the Espinosa-Porcelain connection before her death.

The Kingdom's participation was coerced. Porcelain visited Mr. Antithesis's Manhattan office and threatened to expose Richardson's Kingdom connections. Richardson's weather powers were required for storm cover, and Mrs. Doppelganger impersonated her at the Harrisburg hearings to maintain her alibi. The timing was deliberate: the hearings, the Boston protest Activation incidents, and the prison break were all designed to fragment law enforcement and media attention simultaneously.

## The Extraction

The four-person team - Mr. Mudslide (liquefaction/tunneling), Vector (telekinesis), Tarbaby (resin generation), and Mrs. Synapse (nerve manipulation/medical) - entered through a J-shaped tunnel Mudslide bored beneath the facility while the B-Team created diversions above. An anti-phase lattice in the titanium ore electrocuted Mudslide during tunneling, but the team reached D-Block successfully.

Mrs. Xenograft had identified a corridor absent from Porcelain's blueprints, suggesting hidden sections the Kingdom was not informed about. Blake Matthews / Mr. Tyrannosaur was designated as contingency but was not deployed.

When Deathgirl woke and copied three powers, she dissolved the tunnel floor and escaped into old mining levels below Daedalus. Tarbaby revealed he had pre-planted a tracker as a contingency.

## Deathgirl's Escape

Interludes DZ.2 and DZ.3 follow Daisy's journey from the flooded mining tunnels to Albany. She maintained Mudslide's liquefaction by "chasing" her anger at him. Switchback (gravity manipulation) helped organize escapees underground using game theory before splitting north toward Canada. Cold-Cut (freezing abilities) accompanied Daisy through dangerous passages - creating ice bridges and sealing tunnel leaks - while Daisy built a spiral ramp up a ventilation shaft with her copied liquefaction. Flux (metal manipulation) removed surface grates.

Above ground, Cold-Cut accompanied Daisy as far as Saratoga before departing. Daisy used a payphone, library, and Chinese-American Cultural Association to locate her parents Wei and Xiuying Zhen in Albany. They activated pre-prepared legal protocols, and attorney Patricia Gilly negotiated Whitford Institute placement - the only specialized facility for powered youth - rather than a return to Daedalus.

## Aftermath

### Political Impact

The timing was devastatingly effective. Senator Martin attempted to leverage the crisis to postpone the Harrisburg hearings, but Rachel Small's coalition reframed the failure: a prison designed for isolation rather than rehabilitation had been breached, proving the containment approach was fundamentally flawed. The anti-vigilante legislation was defeated 11-9 in committee, with Senator Cho casting the deciding vote.

### Shrike's Campaign

Collateral escapee Niles Nolan / Shrike - a serial killer with spike-creation powers and anti-Semitic motivations, one of Liberty Belle's first captures in 2010 - targeted Sam as Belle's successor. His escalating campaign (dead birds, an impaled bloodhound, an elaborate hostage operation, a home invasion at the Small residence) drove Book 13's second half and led directly to Book 14.

### Legal Precedent

The DOJ demanded federal custody of Deathgirl, but Gilly successfully argued for the Whitford Institute, establishing that a specialized therapeutic facility was preferable to maximum security for a 13-year-old. Porcelain observed the hearing in disguise, suggesting the outcome served his interests.

## Trivia

- Porcelain was "not concerned about collateral escapes," confirming the chaos was intentional.
- The extraction team received $2M per surviving operator, paid by Red Calf through the Kingdom.
- Blake Matthews and Mrs. Quiet privately agreed the operation "smells wrong" at the planning meeting, foreshadowing the Kingdom's reluctant participation.
- Mrs. Xenograft identified a missing corridor in Porcelain's blueprints, raising questions about undocumented sections of Daedalus.
