## Overview

The Daedalus Prison Break was a coordinated assault on the nation's first purpose-built superhuman prison, carried out on September 10, 2025. The operation was not initiated by the Kingdom of Keys but forced upon them by Porcelain - widely described as "the strongest superhuman on Earth" and leader of the Red Calf paramilitary organization - who blackmailed Maya Richardson into compliance. The primary objective was the extraction of Daisy Zhen, a 13-year-old with the ability to copy other superhumans' powers.

The operation succeeded in breaching the facility but failed to secure its target: Deathgirl woke prematurely during extraction, copied multiple powers from her rescuers simultaneously, and escaped into the prison's lower tunnels. She eventually made her way to Albany, New York, where she reunited with her parents. Approximately fifty prisoners escaped during the chaos, including at least seven high-risk individuals who remained at large for weeks. One of those escapees - Niles Nolan / Shrike - subsequently targeted Sam Small in a sustained campaign of terror across northeast Philadelphia.

## Background

Porcelain's connection to Daedalus predated the facility's completion. During construction in 2006, an Israeli military consultant named "Chezki Espinosa" observed testing of containment systems and praised the work of contractor Morris "Pop-pop Moe" Small of Horvath-Small Ltd. Liberty Belle later investigated Daedalus's concerning isolation features and identified the Espinosa-Porcelain connection before her death. The extraction operation thus represented a return to a facility Porcelain had studied from inception.

The Kingdom's participation was coerced. Interlude MR.8 reveals that Porcelain visited Mr. Antithesis's Manhattan office and left him in rare emotional distress, having threatened to expose Richardson's dual identity. Richardson's weather powers were required for storm cover, and Mrs. Doppelganger was assigned to impersonate her at the Harrisburg state senate hearings - where anti-vigilante legislation was being debated - to maintain her alibi. The timing was deliberate: the hearings, the Boston protest Activation incidents, and the prison break were all designed to fragment the attention of law enforcement and media simultaneously.

## The Extraction

The extraction team consisted of four Kingdom operatives: Mr. Mudslide (liquefaction, tunneling), Vector (telekinesis), Tarbaby (resin generation), and Mrs. Synapse (nerve manipulation/medical). They entered through a J-shaped tunnel Mr. Mudslide bored beneath the facility while the B-Team created diversions above. An anti-phase lattice in the titanium ore electrocuted Mudslide during tunneling, but the team reached Cell Block D successfully.

Mrs. Xenograft had identified a corridor absent from the blueprints Porcelain provided, suggesting hidden sections of the prison the Kingdom was not informed about. Blake Matthews / Mr. Tyrannosaur was designated as "contingency response" - to "drop a T-Rex on it" if required - but was not deployed.

When Deathgirl woke prematurely and copied three powers simultaneously, she dissolved the tunnel floor beneath her and escaped into old mining levels below Daedalus. Tarbaby revealed he had pre-planted a tracker on her as a contingency. The team extracted by helicopter while tracking Deathgirl's northward movement.

## Deathgirl's Escape

Interludes DZ.2 and DZ.3 follow Daisy Zhen's journey from the flooded mining tunnels beneath Daedalus to Albany. She maintained Mudslide's liquefaction powers by "chasing" her anger at him, and encountered other escapees who recognized "Deathgirl, the copier." Switchback (gravity manipulation) reluctantly guided her south, and Cold-Cut (freezing abilities) accompanied her through dangerous passages - creating ice bridges, sealing tunnel leaks, and building a spiral ramp up a ventilation shaft. Flux (metal manipulation) removed grates at the surface.

The escapees split above ground. Cold-Cut accompanied Daisy south as far as Saratoga, then departed. Daisy used a payphone, a library, and a Chinese-American Cultural Association to locate her parents Wei and Xiuying Zhen on Western Avenue in Albany. Her parents activated pre-prepared emergency legal protocols, and attorney Patricia Gilly negotiated her placement at the Whitford Institute in Chicago - the only specialized facility for powered youth - rather than a return to Daedalus.

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences

The break released approximately fifty prisoners, with at least seven high-risk individuals (the "Magnificent Seven") remaining at large. Crossroads reported "ski mask military gear types" at the facility during the aftermath, suggesting federal investigation. The operation exposed a critical vulnerability: despite Daedalus being described as purpose-built and virtually inescapable, a determined external assault with powered operatives and insider knowledge of the facility's design proved capable of breaching it.

### Political Impact

The timing was devastatingly effective. Senator Martin attempted to leverage the Daedalus crisis to postpone the Harrisburg hearings, but Rachel Small's coalition reframed the failure: a superhuman prison designed for isolation rather than rehabilitation had been breached, proving the containment-based approach was fundamentally flawed. The anti-vigilante legislation was defeated 11-9 in committee, with Senator Cho casting the deciding vote.

### Shrike's Campaign

One of the collateral escapees - Niles Nolan / Shrike - was a serial killer with spike-creation powers and explicitly anti-Semitic motivations. One of Liberty Belle's first captures in 2010, Shrike targeted Sam Small as Belle's successor. His escalating campaign (dead birds across northeast Philadelphia, an impaled bloodhound dog, an elaborate hostage operation, and a home invasion at the Small residence) drove the narrative of Book 13's second half and led directly to the events of Book 14.

### Legal Precedent

The custody battle over Deathgirl set significant precedent: the DOJ demanded federal custody, but Patricia Gilly successfully argued for the Whitford Institute - establishing that a specialized therapeutic facility for powered youth was preferable to a maximum-security prison for a 13-year-old. Porcelain observed the hearing in disguise, suggesting the outcome served his interests.

## Trivia

- Porcelain was described as "not concerned about collateral escapes," confirming the chaos was intentional rather than a failure of the operation.
- Mr. Mudslide insisted on bringing Deathgirl's penguin plushie "Mr. Waddles" during the extraction - a moment of unexpected humanity from a Kingdom operative.
- The extraction team received $2M per surviving operator, paid by Red Calf through the Kingdom.
- Blake Matthews and Mrs. Quiet privately agreed the operation "smells wrong" at the planning meeting, foreshadowing the Kingdom's reluctant participation.
- Mrs. Xenograft identified a missing corridor in the blueprints Porcelain provided, raising questions about what sections of Daedalus remain undocumented.
