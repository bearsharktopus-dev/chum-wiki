# Project Titan

> A classified U.S. military program (2006-2013) that first attempted to artificially induce superhuman abilities in soldiers and, after that effort failed, pivoted to integrating naturally occurring metahumans into military command structures.

## Overview

Project Titan was a top-secret Department of Defense initiative authorized by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in March 2006, responding to the growing global prevalence of superhuman individuals. Classified TOP SECRET//NOFORN throughout its existence, it underwent two distinct phases: an experimental program aimed at creating superhumans artificially, and a subsequent effort to integrate naturally powered personnel into existing military structures.

Both phases were overseen by the Project Titan Oversight Committee. General James D. Thurman authored the Phase Two final assessment, recommending a continued but more targeted approach.

## Background

By the mid-2000s, conventional armed forces lacked doctrine, equipment, or organizational frameworks for operating alongside - or against - metahuman combatants. Incidents such as the Tesla Incident had demonstrated the catastrophic consequences of engaging superhumans without adequate preparation. The Joint Chiefs authorized Project Titan with three core objectives: developing reliable artificial induction methods, understanding superhuman activation mechanisms, and creating a controllable source of superhuman military assets.

## Timeline

### Phase One: Artificial Induction (2006-2008)

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| March 15, 2006 | Joint Chiefs authorize Project Titan with a two-year mandate |
| 2006-2008 | 500 military volunteers recruited; rigorous screening and informed consent obtained |
| 2006-2008 | Radiation exposure experiments (gamma, cosmic, other): no activations; 12% develop severe health complications |
| 2006-2008 | Chemical/biological agent trials from superhuman blood work: 2 subjects display temporary enhanced strength, unreplicable, resulting in organ failure |
| 2006-2008 | Psychological stress tests (simulated near-death): 3 subjects activate, consistent with the general population rate of 0.15% |
| 2006-2008 | CRISPR/gene therapy targeting theorized superhuman genes: no activations; 1 subject develops uncontrolled cellular growth and is terminated |
| August 12, 2008 | Phase One assessment: committee recommends cessation of all artificial induction and transition to Phase Two |

### Phase Two: Integration and Utilization (2008-2013)

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2008 | Restructuring begins; recruitment of naturally occurring superhuman personnel commences |
| 2008-2009 | 5 training bases, 3 R&D centers, and 2 specialized medical facilities established; standardized protocols and adaptive equipment developed |
| 2009-2013 | ~65% of identified superhuman personnel successfully integrated into specialized units |
| 2009-2013 | Superhuman units effective in hostage rescue, disaster response, and special operations; less impactful in conventional warfare |
| 2009-2013 | ~35% struggle with military structure; some receive honorable discharges. Higher-than-expected PTSD rates observed |
| 2009-2013 | Retention challenges as members leave for private sector or cite disagreement with military structure |
| October 12, 2013 | General Thurman submits final assessment recommending continued but more targeted integration |

## Aftermath

Phase One's human cost was severe: 3 deaths, 67 severe complications, 212 mild-to-moderate complications, 89 PTSD diagnoses, and 134 other psychological disorders. Estimated lifetime healthcare costs for affected participants reached $890 million on top of $1.2 billion in research spending - an effective cost of $400 million per activation, with only 3 statistically insignificant successes.

Phase Two's final assessment identified persistent structural problems: command hierarchy friction, resource-intensive individualized training, inadequate psychological support, unresolved international law questions regarding superhuman warfare, and budgetary strain. The committee recommended narrower specialization, revised training emphasizing psychological resilience, more flexible command structures, and diplomatic engagement toward international superhuman warfare conventions.

All project data remained classified at TOP SECRET//NOFORN.

## Legacy

Project Titan's definitive demonstration that artificial induction is not feasible effectively closed that line of military research, redirecting strategy toward working with the existing metahuman population. The Phase Two infrastructure - training bases, R&D centers, medical facilities, and organizational doctrines - established foundational precedents for U.S. military engagement with metahuman capabilities. Lessons regarding command integration, the psychological burden of superhuman service, and limitations in conventional warfare informed subsequent planning and contributed to the broader national framework alongside systems such as PERKS and the NSRA.

The project also highlighted the tension between military ambition and ethical constraint. The high Phase One casualty rates and Phase Two mental health toll underscored the human costs of treating superhuman abilities as military assets - a tension that continues to shape policy debates.

## Trivia

- The Phase One activation rate (0.6%, 3 of 500) was not statistically significant versus the general population rate of 0.15% (p > 0.05), meaning the experiments produced no measurable effect beyond natural occurrence.
- Phase Two's total five-year budget was $17 billion, with $5 billion in the first year alone, requiring approximately 5,000 support staff.
- The Phase One report recommended classifying all data under the same legal framework (U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 798) used for PERKS assessment documentation.
- General Thurman is the only named individual on the Oversight Committee; Phase One report signatories are fully redacted.
