## Overview

The Big Raid was a global, coordinated assault on superhuman criminal networks launched in 2018 by GESSOC (Global Enforcement and Suppression of Superhuman Organized Crime), an international task force assembled specifically for the operation. It remains the most sweeping anti-crime operation ever conducted, combining government, superhero, and law enforcement resources across the world to dismantle supervillain organizations and their entangled traditional crime syndicate partners.

The operation exposed how deeply superhuman criminal groups had merged with mafias, cartels, and triads, leading GESSOC to expand well beyond its original superhuman-focused mandate. While widely celebrated as a historic achievement, the resulting power vacuum gave rise to faceless, decentralized syndicates far more violent than their predecessors. As of 2023, its legacy remains deeply contested.

## Background

By the late 2010s, superhuman criminal organizations had become deeply enmeshed with traditional organized crime networks, forming a vast, interconnected infrastructure that no single nation could address. Superhuman abilities expanded criminal enterprises' reach and insulated their leadership from law enforcement. GESSOC was founded in March 2018 as a purpose-built task force to coordinate a simultaneous worldwide strike, bringing together superhero teams and intelligence resources under a unified command.

## Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| March 2018 | GESSOC formally established; coordinated strikes launched against high-profile supervillain organizations worldwide |
| Weeks following | Deep links between superhuman and traditional crime syndicates uncovered; operational scope expanded |
| Subsequent weeks | Major organizations dismantled in rapid succession; high-ranking crime lords arrested or turned informant, triggering cascading collapses |
| Immediate post-Raid | Power vacuum triggers turf wars as smaller gangs and emerging superhuman criminals scramble for control |
| Months following | Drug prices spike; laundering-dependent businesses collapse; seized assets redistributed primarily through government channels |
| 2018-2019 | New decentralized syndicates consolidate in the vacuum |
| By 2023 | Post-Raid criminal landscape has stabilized into anonymous, fluid, and more violent networks |

## Aftermath

### Criminal Landscape

The old hierarchy's destruction created a massive power vacuum. The organizations that eventually consolidated were faceless, decentralized, and anonymous - lacking the named leadership, codes of honor, and public notoriety of the old crime families. They favored stealth and technological sophistication over spectacle, with transactional loyalty and constant personnel turnover that made infiltration and prosecution far more difficult. The new criminal element was also markedly more violent, with a greater willingness to engage in lethal confrontations and higher civilian collateral.

### Economic Impact

The abrupt collapse of black market industries sent shockwaves through local and national economies. Drug prices spiked, creating both a public health crisis and a surge in drug-related crime. Businesses that had unknowingly served as laundering fronts shuttered, devastating neighborhood economies. Seized assets were redistributed unevenly, disproportionately benefiting government agencies. Corporations overhauled financial safeguards in response, driving up compliance costs, though these pressures eventually spurred innovations in governance and transparency.

### Legal and Political Responses

In the United States, federal funding for the NSRA and other superhuman law enforcement increased substantially, with some states granting expanded pursuit and arrest powers and increasing investment in juvenile metahuman recruitment programs. Europe expanded surveillance capabilities and introduced stricter anti-terror legislation. Japan and South Korea pursued regulated superhuman integration emphasizing oversight, while Russia and North Korea granted near-unlimited power to superhuman enforcement agencies, drawing international criticism.

Public reaction was sharply divided between civil liberties advocates protesting expanded government powers and those supporting stronger measures against the more unpredictable criminal landscape.

## Legacy

The Big Raid is defined by a fundamental duality: extraordinary success in dismantling entrenched criminal empires, yet simultaneously giving birth to a criminal landscape many consider more dangerous.

Superheroes initially enjoyed a surge of public support, but growing awareness of collateral damage and concerns about superhumans in law enforcement eroded some goodwill. The Raid also blurred villain-hero lines, as some supervillains had played roles in the takedown. The romanticized image of the charismatic crime lord was replaced by an anonymous, faceless menace - producing pervasive unease that the post-Raid threats are less comprehensible and therefore more frightening.

Institutionally, the Raid demonstrated the potential of large-scale international cooperation between governments and superhero organizations, establishing a model for future operations. Its lessons continue to inform policy debates about superhuman law enforcement, civil liberties, and the balance between security and freedom.

## Trivia

- The Big Raid is the subject of a seven-part retrospective by journalist Alex Chen, published in HeroWatch Today (April-June 2023) for the five-year anniversary.
- Among the unintended economic consequences, the drug price spike was less severe in states like Colorado and California where legal marijuana was already available.
