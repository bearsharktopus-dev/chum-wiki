## Overview

The Big Raid was a global, coordinated assault on superhuman criminal networks launched in 2018 by GESSOC, an international task force assembled specifically for the operation. Drawing on the combined resources of governments, superhero teams, and law enforcement agencies across the world, the operation targeted the supervillain organizations and criminal syndicates that had entrenched themselves in the global underworld over the preceding decades. It remains the most sweeping anti-crime operation ever conducted.

The Raid succeeded in its primary objective: the rapid and systematic destruction of the world's most powerful criminal organizations. High-ranking crime lords, both superhuman and non-superhuman, were arrested in rapid succession. Many others turned informant to save themselves, accelerating the collapse of their own organizations. The operation exposed the deep entanglement between superhuman criminal groups and traditional organized crime families, ultimately leading GESSOC to expand its scope well beyond its original superhuman-focused mandate.

While widely regarded as a historic achievement, the Big Raid also had severe unintended consequences. The power vacuum left by the fallen empires gave rise to a new generation of criminal syndicates -- faceless, decentralized, and far more violent than their predecessors. The economic disruption was widespread, and the legal and political aftershocks continue to reverberate years later. As of 2023, five years after the event, its legacy remains deeply contested.

## Background

By the late 2010s, superhuman criminal organizations had grown into a formidable global problem. Supervillain groups had accumulated enormous power and influence, operating with near-impunity in many jurisdictions. These groups were not isolated actors; they had become deeply enmeshed with traditional organized crime networks -- mafias, triads, cartels, and similar syndicates -- forming a vast, interconnected criminal infrastructure. Superhuman abilities were used to expand the reach of these enterprises and to insulate their leadership from law enforcement.

The scale and sophistication of these intertwined networks exceeded the capacity of any single nation's law enforcement to address. In response, GESSOC was founded in March 2018 as a purpose-built international task force. It was not a preexisting agency but was created specifically for this mission: to coordinate and execute a simultaneous worldwide strike against superhuman organized crime. GESSOC brought together superhero teams and intelligence resources from across the globe under a unified operational command.

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| March 2018 | GESSOC formally established as an international task force with the mandate to dismantle superhuman criminal networks |
| March 2018 (initial phase) | Coordinated strikes launched against high-profile supervillain organizations and known criminal metahumans worldwide |
| Weeks following initial strikes | GESSOC operatives uncover deep links between superhuman criminal groups and traditional organized crime syndicates; operational scope expanded accordingly |
| Subsequent weeks | Surgical raids dismantle major criminal organizations in rapid succession; high-ranking crime lords arrested or turned informant, triggering cascading collapses of criminal hierarchies |
| Immediate post-Raid period | Power vacuum triggers intense turf wars and instability as smaller gangs and emerging superhuman criminals scramble for control |
| Months following | Drug prices spike sharply; local businesses tied to laundering networks collapse; seized assets redistributed, primarily through government channels |
| 2018--2019 | New, decentralized criminal syndicates begin to consolidate in the vacuum left by the old empires |
| By 2023 | The post-Raid criminal landscape has stabilized into a new paradigm of anonymous, fluid, and more violent criminal networks |

## Aftermath

The immediate consequences of the Big Raid were dramatic and far-reaching, touching every dimension of global society.

### Criminal Landscape

The destruction of the old criminal hierarchy created a massive power vacuum. Smaller gangs and opportunistic metahuman criminals rushed to claim territory, sparking a chaotic period of turf wars and street violence. The organizations that eventually consolidated bore little resemblance to their predecessors. The new syndicates were faceless, decentralized, and anonymous -- lacking the named leadership, codes of honor, and public notoriety of the old crime families. They operated with cold pragmatism, favoring stealth and technological sophistication over spectacle. Loyalty within these groups was transactional and fleeting, with criminals shifting between organizations constantly, making infiltration and prosecution far more difficult.

The new criminal element was also markedly more violent. Operating under the assumption that capture meant certain defeat, these criminals showed a far greater willingness to engage in lethal confrontations with law enforcement and superheroes alike. Street-level violence increased, and civilians were more frequently caught in the crossfire.

### Economic Impact

The Raid caused immediate and severe economic disruption. The abrupt collapse of black market industries -- particularly the drug trade -- sent shockwaves through local and national economies. Drug prices spiked, creating both a public health crisis and a surge in drug-related crime. Numerous small businesses that had unknowingly served as fronts for money laundering operations lost their funding and shuttered, devastating neighborhood economies and eliminating jobs. Seized illicit assets were redistributed, but the process was uneven and disproportionately benefited government agencies rather than affected communities.

On a macroeconomic level, corporations were forced to overhaul financial safeguards in response to the exposure of laundering networks, driving up compliance costs. Consumer spending patterns fluctuated in affected areas. Over time, these pressures spurred innovations in corporate governance and transparency, but the short-term pain was widely felt.

### Legal and Political Responses

Legal systems worldwide were forced to adapt rapidly. In the United States, federal funding for the NSRA and other superhuman law enforcement units was increased substantially. Some states passed legislation granting these units expanded pursuit and arrest powers. Many state and municipal governments also increased funding for juvenile superhuman training and recruitment programs, aiming to bring young metahumans into the lawful fold before they could turn to crime.

In Europe, several nations expanded surveillance capabilities and introduced stricter anti-terror legislation. Japan and South Korea pursued a more regulated integration of superhuman abilities into their legal systems, emphasizing oversight and ethical guidelines. Russia and North Korea took a more authoritarian approach, granting near-unlimited power to their superhuman enforcement agencies, drawing international criticism for potential human rights violations.

Public reaction was sharply divided. Civil liberties advocates and rights organizations protested the expansion of government powers, particularly the increased use of superhuman abilities in law enforcement. Conversely, a significant portion of the public, driven by fear of the new and more unpredictable criminal landscape, supported stronger measures. This divide was especially pronounced in urban areas, where superhuman crime was most visible.

## Legacy

The Big Raid is widely regarded as one of the most pivotal events in recent world history. Its legacy is defined by a fundamental duality: it was an extraordinary success in its stated objective of dismantling entrenched criminal empires, yet it simultaneously gave birth to a criminal landscape that many consider more dangerous and harder to combat than what came before.

The operation permanently altered public perception of superheroes and supervillains. In the immediate wake of the Raid, superheroes enjoyed a surge of public support and admiration. Over time, however, growing awareness of collateral damage, questions about accountability, and concerns about the expanding role of superhumans in law enforcement eroded some of that goodwill. The Raid also complicated the public image of supervillains: some had played roles in the takedown of criminal networks, blurring the line between hero and villain in ways that persist in public discourse.

The romanticized image of the powerful crime lord -- charismatic, operating by a code, larger than life -- was replaced in the public imagination by an anonymous, faceless menace. This shift produced a pervasive unease, a sense that the threats of the post-Raid world are less comprehensible and therefore more frightening than those of the old order.

On an institutional level, the Raid demonstrated the potential of large-scale international cooperation between governments and superhero organizations, establishing a model for future collaborative operations. GESSOC's formation and operational success proved that coordinated global action against superhuman threats was achievable, even if its secondary consequences were not fully anticipated. The lessons of the Big Raid continue to inform policy debates about superhuman law enforcement, civil liberties, economic resilience, and the proper balance between security and freedom.

## Trivia

- The Big Raid is the subject of a seven-part retrospective series by journalist Alex Chen, published in HeroWatch Today between April and June 2023 to mark the five-year anniversary of the operation.
- GESSOC was founded specifically for the Big Raid and did not exist as an organization prior to 2018.
- The operation initially targeted only superhuman criminal groups but expanded its scope after discovering that these groups were deeply intertwined with traditional organized crime networks such as mafias, cartels, and triads.
- Among the unintended economic consequences of the Raid, drug prices spiked nationwide, an effect noted to be less severe in states like Colorado and California where legal marijuana was already available.
- The Raid led to a notable increase in government investment in juvenile metahuman recruitment programs, reflecting a strategic shift toward prevention rather than purely reactive enforcement.
